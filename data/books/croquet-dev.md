A bit about this site
The purpose of CroquetDev is to help people develop their association croquet.  It is written from my own experiences over many years of playing croquet.  I have attempted to write articles in a detailed but easily understandable way.  This site is not intended as a replacement for any other croquet site on the internet - it is simply my own thoughts and opinions.  This site is in no way completed but I intend to add additional info over time.
The diagrams on this site are all SVG files, which means they are scalable to any size without degrading the quality, and take up next-to-no space whatsoever compared with images.  All the diagrams have been created by me using Figma.  The animations are also SVGs, with object animation done by a tool called SVGator.  All the photos have been taken by me over the years (except the one with me in it).  
If you have any feedback, requests or even wish to host your own article on this site, please let me know.
This isn't a croquet news website, and hence does not get updated daily, or even weekly.  But every so often there should be a significant update to the site.  If you would like to be notified whenever there is a meaningful update to this site, feel free to subscribe by putting your email into the box below - you will receive a confirmation email (check your junk folder) with a link to click to confirm your subscription.

Intro

          The following article gives a basic overview of Association Croquet
          (or simply "croquet") and is aimed at those who have not played
          before. As such it does not go into low-level detail. This site has
          further sections which explore various facets of the sport in much
          greater detail, but if you are new to the game then this is the place
          to start.
        







          Association Croquet is a mallet sport often likened to a cross between
          snooker and golf. It is played on equal terms between men and women,
          and between players of all ages. There is also a robust handicapping
          system used in croquet (as with golf) meaning that a handicap game can
          be enjoyed between players with vastly differing abilities. As with
          other sports such as tennis, croquet can be played as either singles
          or doubles. Croquet requires a good ability to think under pressure
          and a certain amount of physical and mental fitness - each game may
          last between 30 minutes and 3 hours (and sometimes longer) and in
          major events these are usually played as best-of-3 or best-of-5 games.
        




              An international-level doubles match between NZ and USA
            



          There are national croquet federations recognised by the World Croquet
          Federation (WCF) in 29 countries around the world, and there is a very
          strong competitive croquet scene in a number of these countries. The
          WCF organises numerous world championship events, both for teams and
          individuals - the most famous event is probably the MacRobertson
          Shield, which is a 4-yearly team event for the 4 strongest
          croquet-playing nations (New Zealand, Australia, England and the USA).
          The shield has been competed for since 1925 and comprises one team
          from each country, each comprised of the 6 best available players from
          that country. In addition to this, there are both 'Open' and 'Womens'
          world championships organised by the WCF, and all the major
          croquet-playing nations also hold national events in various
          categories. As well as national events, there are regional and
          inter-club tournaments, and of course local club championships at most
          croquet clubs.
        





The game

          The game itself is a contest between two sides - one playing the blue
          & black balls, and the other playing the red & yellow balls. The basic
          objective is to score 26 points with your balls before your opponent
          does with theirs. A single point is scored by hitting oneâ€™s ball through a hoop.  The hoops are numbered and must be scored in a specific order. In order to play most effectively, it is best to try and score several hoops in one turn (known as "playing a break") - this is
          where the snooker comparison comes in. Unlike snooker, however, it is
          impossible to finish a game in one single turn without giving your
          opponent any chance - this is because in croquet each side has 2
          balls, and upon the start of a player's turn they must decide which
          ball they want to play with for the duration of that turn. While it is
          possible for Player A to score all of the hoops for one of their balls
          in a single turn, the turn must come to a stop at some point in order
          for Player B to play their turn, before the Player A can have another
          opportunity to score points with their second (or "partner") ball. Play at
          the expert level often involves a player scoring points with one of
          their balls while also manoeuvring the other balls around the court to
          specific positions in order to cause their partner ball to travel
          through some of its own hoops (called "peeling").
        




              English player Gabrielle Higgins is playing the yellow ball and is
              lining up a peel on partner ball (red)
            



          You win a game of croquet by hitting your balls onto the peg - this is
          called a pegout. This can only be done after each of your balls has
          scored all of its hoops.

The Court

          There are 6 hoops, numbered "1" through to "6" at fixed positions
          around the court, plus a "peg" in the very centre of the court. In
          order to score 26 points, you must run each of your balls through each
          of its hoops in the correct order twice (once in each direction) and
          then hit both your balls onto the peg in the middle. The hoops "7"
          through to "12" are not named as such, with hoop 7 being called
          "1-back" and so on, as you can see on the diagram below,

Turns and Shots

          The game starts off with the toss of a coin and the winner of the toss
          is allowed to decide whether to play first or second, or may instead
          choose which colours to play with. The balls are initially played into
          the game from either of the two 'baulk' lines (measured in exactly 1
          yard from the white line), and once all the balls are in the game, the
          player when beginning their turn can elect to play with either ball.
          Each turns consists initially of only one shot. With this shot, if you
          fail to hit your ball onto another ball, or fail to score your current
          hoop, then that is the end of your turn.
        

          However, it is possible to extend your turn to multiple shots -
          sometimes many dozens - the following rules apply:
        


Make a roquet - a roquet is when you hit your ball
            onto another ball - doing so will earn two extra shots
          

Score a hoop - hitting your ball through its
            current hoop - doing so will earn one extra shot
          

Let's look at these in more detail:
Making a roquet

          Hitting your ball onto another ball is one of the fundamentals of
          croquet. At the start of every turn, with your ball you are allowed to
          "roquet" each of the other balls once.




                Former world champion, Joe Hogan, about to make a roquet
              


Every time you make a roquet,
          you will earn two extra shots - these extra shots cannot be
          accumulated and saved to be used later; they must be played
          immediately following a roquet. The extra shots are as follows:
        


Croquet stroke - this is the shot from which the
            game takes its name. After making a roquet, you are entitled to pick
            up your ball and place it in contact with the ball you just
            roqueted. Then you hit your ball again in a way that causes both
            balls to move
          

Continuation stroke - after the "croquet" stroke,
            you receive one more shot called a continuation stroke. With this,
            the idea is usually to roquet another ball (thereby gaining an
            additional two shots again) or score your hoop
          







                  With yellow and blue in contact, Alain Giraud has played a
                  croquet stroke by striking yellow so that both balls move
                








                  After playing a croquet stroke, Reg Bamford earns a
                  continuation stroke and can run the hoop with black
                




Scoring a hoop

          In order to score a hoop, your ball must pass completely through it,
          with none of the ball visible on the playing side of the hoop. When
          your ball passes through its current hoop, you receive one additional
          stroke.
        




              The arrows above indicate the direction of travel of the blue
              ball. On the left, the ball has not started to run the hoop; the
              image in the middle shows a ball that has started to run the hoop
              but not completed; the image on the right shows a ball that has
              fully completed running the hoop
            



          When you score the hoop and earn your additional stroke, your ball
          once again becomes "live" on all the other balls, meaning it can
          roquet each one of them again once before it has to score another
          hoop.
        

          To find out more detail about the above shots, and many others,
          navigate to the
          Shots section


Utilising the other balls

          As mentioned above, at the start of each turn, your ball is 'live' on
          all the other 3 balls â€“ this means it is able to roquet any of them.
          You are only allowed to roquet each other ball once before scoring
          your hoop, however. When a hoop point is scored, it resets this
          allowance, and your ball can roquet each of the other balls once
          again.
        



            Click on the above picture to see a basic animation of the sequence
            of shots. In the animation, blue is the striker's ball and it
            roquets each other ball once before running its hoop
          



          By using this sequence of roquet > croquet > continuation to utilise
          each ball, you can look to position each of the balls around the court
          in a way that enables you to manoeuvre your ball through its hoops and
          score multiple hoops in a single turn - this is called "playing a
          break", just as in snooker. You are not required to use each of the
          other balls before running your hoop, but the more balls that you
          utilise, the more additional shots you will obtain. The more shots you
          have, the smaller (and easier) each shot can be. There is a lot more
          information about the different types of breaks that can be played, in
          the Breaks section

Turn-ending shots

          Before we go any further, it's important to realise what things will
          cause your turn to end - these are:
        

Failing your hoop
Missing a roquet

            In a croquet stroke (2-ball stroke), sending either of the balls off the court, or not causing both balls to move when playing the stroke
          

Additionally, if you commit an illegal stroke (known as a "fault"), this will cause your turn to end.  An example of this might be if you accidentally hit your ball twice in a single stroke.  This article is not intending to cover all the various faults in detail.
Note that if you accidentally 'feather' your ball with the mallet while lining up a shot, without the intention of hitting it, this does not count as a stroke in croquet - whether a stroke is counted is all about the intent of hitting the ball - this is opposite when compared to sports like golf or snooker.


Handicap and Advanced
Handicap play

        Just like in golf, every croquet player is assigned a handicap when they
        first start playing. A handicap is a number, and the lower it is, the
        more skillful a player you are. Handicaps start at 24 for an absolute
        beginner and go all the way down to -3 (minus 3) for the very best
        players in the world. Each player has a handicap card which they use to
        record their results, and based on wins and losses against players of
        different abilities, they gain and lose points, which in turn
        automatically adjusts their handicap. The idea behind the handicap
        system is to allow two players of vastly different abilities to be able
        to enjoy a competitive game against each other. In a handicap game, the
        weaker player (the player with the higher handicap) receives extra turns
        called "bisques" based on the difference between the two players'
        handicaps - for example a handicap 10 player would give 6 bisques to a
        handicap 16 player. A bisque is physically represented by a small white wooden stick, which is stuck into the ground (off-court).  The handicap 16 player can choose to "take a bisque"
        at the end of their turn (signified by removing the bisque from the ground), which effectively enables them to start an additional turn from where they left off, being live on all the balls once again. An example might be
        if the handicap 16 player fails a hoop, or misses a roquet - taking a
        bisque can allow them to keep going with their turn from the current position of
        the balls. There is no limit to how many of their bisques the player can
        use in a turn. Half-bisques also exist - represented by a smaller wooden stick - where for example a handicap 1.5
        player plays a handicap 6 player, the handicap 6 player will receive 4.5
        bisques. Just like a full bisque, the half bisque is an extra turn, but
        is more limited in that no point can be scored with it.
      
Advanced play

        Advanced play is the most common form of croquet, where players compete
        on equal terms and no bisques are exchanged. Instead, players compete
        under the same rules on both sides. Penalties called "lifts" are
        introduced - these are conceded when the 1-back and 4-back hoops are
        run. After you run either 1-back or 4-back, your opponent may begin
        their turn by lifting either of their balls and playing it from anywhere
        on either of the two baulk lines (see the court diagram further up this
        page). An additional penalty called a "contact" also exists if a player
        scores 1-back and 4-back in the same turn (if their partner ball hasn't
        already passed through 1-back) - a contact means that the opponent can
        begin their turn by lifting either of their balls and actually taking
        croquet from any of the other balls without having to make the initial
        roquet first. This usually gives the opponent a very easy start to their
        turn, and as a result, it is not common to see players conceding
        contact.
      




            Scottish no.2, Sam Murray, makes a leave after running a lift hoop
          



        After running a lift hoop, but before ending their turn, players will
        normally contrive to arrange the balls in a position far away from the
        baulk lines, leaving the opponent no roquet shorter than 13 yards or so
        - called "making a leave" - and there is a whole section of the site
        dedicated to this.
      

Conclusion and next steps

        Now you have a basic understanding of the sport of croquet, I encourage
        you to contact your nearest club to get some lessons. There is a lot
        more detail on the finer points of croquet elsewhere on this site, so
        please feel free to explore it. Use this site (and other sites) to
        supplement your hands-on learning.

Shots
To borrow from John Prince's croquet video, "A famous player once remarked that hitting one's own
                        ball
                        correctly was the only difficult thing in croquet". 
Below you will find an overview of the shots involved in croquet, and some high-level guidance on how
                    to achieve them. More detailed information on specific strokes may also be found in the Technique section
If you have read the introduction section, or are already somewhat familiar with croquet, then you
                    will
                    realise that there are two basic types of stroke involved - single ball strokes and croquet
                    strokes.

Roquet
A roquet is the act of hitting your ball onto another ball.  A roquet can be made at any distance, be it the length of the court, or from just a few inches.  Most of what is written in the Technique section covers how to play with a technique that you would use to make a roquet.
To reiterate, it is important to develop a smooth, unhurried swing.  The best way to do this is to stand far enough back from the ball so that your swing is free and you can clearly see the aiming line.  Finding the aiming line is easier if you are able to see your own ball and also the target ball in your peripheral vision, and therefore when you have taken your stance, your head should not be any further forward than the back of the striker's ball.  Once the aiming has been completed, the only thought should then be on striking your own ball with the centre of the mallet, and keeping your head down throughout the strike.



A roquet should be hit with a smooth strike and the mallet should be flat upon impact with the ball


Remember to ensure that whatever technique you use, it should be the same for roquets of any distance.  A good practice routine for roqueting is to take two sets of balls, and place each set 4-5 yards apart.  Take 4 shots.  If you hit them all, then extend the range to 5 yards and repeat.  Keep extending the range by a yard each time.

Rush
Not exactly what the name implies, there is nothing hurried about a rush! A rush is simply a
                        roquet but from
                        short range - indeed, sometimes a rush is referred to as a "roquet-rush". What sets a rush apart
                        from a
                        normal roquet is that instead of just trying to hit the target ball (as with a roquet), the aim
                        of the rush
                        is to send the target ball to a specific spot or area so that the next shot (a croquet stroke) is
                        played from
                        as easy a place as possible. 



A short rush. Notice that the mallet is parallel to the
                                    ground at
                                    point of contact


An example of this might be when your ball is 1-foot away from
                        another ball and
                        you would attempt to roquet the ball so that it stops near to your current hoop - from there you
                        could play
                        your croquet stroke from a position that is already close to your hoop!
A rush that is not in a straight line is referred to as a "cut rush", whereby you aim at a point on the object ball that is off-centre.  In exactly the same concept as in snooker or pool, when the centre of your ball hits the spot on the object ball, the object ball will travel in a direction in line with that spot.



A cut rush to send red to a particular spot


The key to being a good croquet player is to avoid having to play difficult shots very often.
                        Mastering the
                        rush is a key part of achieving this goal.

Hoop Shot
When running a hoop, the same principle applies as with making a roquet. It is particularly
                        important here to
                        observe a smooth follow-through, because this will enable the ball to be imparted with natural
                        forward-spin
                        so that the ball is rolling - not skidding - when it reaches the hoop. Any minor misjudgement of
                        direction
                        of the shot may be alleviated by the forward spin that has been imparted. Conversely it you were
                        to jab at
                        the ball with a quick stabbing motion, it would negate any natural forward spin and cause the
                        ball to skid
                        along the ground - this can result in the ball stopping and sticking in the hoop upon contact
                        with the
                        hoop upright.
When running hoops from an angle, the key thing to remember is that the ball must miss the "near wire"
                        (the hoop upright closest to the ball) in order to run the hoop. Even a light brush against the
                        near wire will result in a failed hoop



Running an angled hoop.  The shot on the left will fail because the centre of the ball is aimed at the centre of the gap.  The shot on the right will succeed because the edge of the ball is aimed to just miss the near upright of the hoop.


While it is true that topspin can help a ball run a hoop, you must avoid the temptation to apply additional topspin via hitting down on the ball - doing so is likely to lead to inaccuracy with direction and also loss of control, and should
                        be reserved for only extreme angles where running the hoop would otherwise be very doubtful.

Croquet strokes

Takeoff
While the takeoff is technically a croquet stroke, in reality it is played in the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke. The main purpose of the takeoff is to position the striker's ball for its continuation
                        stroke, and
                        leave the croqueted ball more-or-less where it is. When playing the takeoff, you must remember
                        that the
                        croqueted ball has to move, otherwise it will not be a valid croquet stroke and incur
                        end-of-turn.

Blue plays a "thick" takeoff from red
                                



You can play a takeoff from either side of the croqueted ball. The amount by which the croqueted
                        ball moves
                        is determined by the angle towards the object ball at which you hit - a small inward angle will
                        result in what is
                        called a "fine" or "thin" takeoff, whereby the croqueted ball just moves maybe an inch or two.
                        If you hit in towards
                        the croqueted ball more, then more momentum will be transferred into it, moving it more -
                        resulting in
                        what's known as a "thick takeoff".
Note also that some natural side-spin will be imparted on the striker's ball due to having been
                        in contact
                        with the croqueted ball. After the striker's ball is struck, and as it slows down, it will curve
                        inwards
                        slightly, in the same direction that which the croqueted ball had been on.

Stop Shot
The stop shot is a croquet stroke which causes the striker's ball to move the shortest
                        distance in
                        relation to the croqueted ball. This is achieved by hitting slightly underneath the
                        centreline of
                        your ball, countering the natural forward spin which would be imparted when playing a normal
                        stroke. The
                        mallet is grounded upon impacting the ball and there is no follow-through. Because the mallet head is angled upward (as shown in the image), the mallet handle is angled slightly further back than normal, so in order to play the stop shot comfortably, you should stand with your feet slightly further back than you would for a normal stroke.
                       





Note the upward angle of the mallet face

Depending on the lawn, balls and mallet weight, ratios of anywhere between 1:5 and 1:10 (and
                        sometimes even
                        higher) can be achieved with a stop shot. It is a good idea to practise and become very familiar
                        with your
                        stop shot ratio, as the easiest way to play a well-controlled break is through the use of
                        accurate stop
                        shots and drives.
Although playing a stop shot is easy, a good technique is required to achieve a good ratio. Essentially the only shot where a smooth strike is unhelpful, it can take a while to master the timing involved in grounding the mallet at the exact moment of impact with the ball.
As mentioned above, you should stand further back from the ball when playing a stop shot because the whole mallet is angled slightly back.  Placement of the feet on this shot varies - some player will take a half-step back with both
                        feet, whereas others will keep one foot in the normal position with the other further behind,
                        rocking onto the back foot to achieve the same result.
Back to top




Drive
The drive is the simplest croquet stroke to play, as it is played exactly the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke - with a normal stance and a normal follow through. Although the ratio will always vary
                        depending on
                        a number of factors (lawn, ball composition and mallet weight), the standard ratio achieved with
                        a drive is
                        about 1:3.



The drive is played like a single-ball stroke
                            


As with the stop shot, it is important to develop a consistent and repeatable drive ratio,
                        because these two
                        strokes are the basis of solid and controlled break play.
                    
Back to top




Half Roll
The half roll is played by hitting slightly downwards onto your ball - this imparts a small
                        amount of extra
                        forward spin compared to a drive, enabling a ratio of about 1:2. In order to play the stroke
                        comfortably,
                        you should stand further forward than for a normal stroke, with your feet (or at least your
                        front foot)
                        about level with the striker's ball. Because you are standing closer to the ball than normal on this shot, moving both your hands down the mallet somewhat will make the shot easier to play, as it will give more control over the mallet and also make the backswing easier.  



The mallet strikes blue at a downward angle
                                to impart
                                additional topspin, increasing the distance blue travels


The half roll can easily be played centre-style, however some players choose to play this stroke
                        side-style
                        in order to generate more power. 
Back to top




Full Roll
The full roll is a croquet stroke where both balls travel approximately the same distance. It is
                        often used
                        as a recovery stroke. In order to get the
                        striker's ball
                        to travel the same distance as the croqueted ball, a lot of forward spin is needed to be
                        imparted on the
                        striker's ball - to achieve this, your hands need to drop a lot further down the mallet than
                        normal, and
                        the mallet should impact the striker's ball at a steeper angle than for a half roll.



The mallet strikes blue at a steep angle,
                                imparting high
                                topspin and causing both balls to travel a similar distance.


The full roll is often played side-style in order to generate enough power in the stroke.
                        However, if the
                        player has good timing and technique, it is possible to play this stroke centre-style. 
Back to top




Pass Roll
The pass roll is similar to the full roll, but the striker's ball travels even further than the croqueted ball. In order to achieve this, even more forward spin is required - as a consequence, the hands need to drop even further down
                        the mallet
                        than for the full roll. The pass roll needs to be played with more punch than the full roll, meaning that the mallet head must still be in the process of accellerating at the moment it makes contact with the ball.  To help achieve this, you can shorten the backswing and apply additional force to the forward swing.  
                    



The mallet strikes blue at an acute angle,
                                creating
                                maximum topspin


Like the full roll, the pass roll is often played side-style in order to generate the power and "punch" required to apply such topspin.  Because of the steep downward angle of the mallet
                        required to generate the necessary forward spin means standing very far forward, playing this stroke
                        centre-style will
                        give a very restricted backswing.  The placement of the bottom hand should be very close to the mallet head, but beware that touching the mallet head during the stroke is a fault.

Split Shot
A split shot is not a croquet stroke in its own right, but rather a variation of the croquet
                        strokes listed above. It can apply to anything from a stop shot through to a pass roll, and
                        refers to playing a croquet stroke where both balls go in different directions.



Line of aim is halfway between the two
                                intended destination points


For a given croquet stroke, the player should line the two balls up in a line of where they wish
                        the object ball to be sent. After determining the intended destination point for the striker's ball, you must aim at a point halfway between the two. The croqueted ball will actually "pull" slightly in the direction which you are playing the stroke, so some allowance needs to be made for that when lining up the two balls.
The wider the angle of split, the less "roll" (topspin) is required to be applied to the striker's
                        ball to get it to travel a given distance - knowing the amount of roll to apply comes with practice.

Special Shots
There are various shots that crop up during a game which are needed to recover from particular situations, such as when you have run a hoop but have a hampered backswing - and deserve special mention.  

Jump Shot
The jump stroke is a single-ball stroke in which you hit downwards onto your ball, causing it to
                        jump into
                        the air. There are a number of reasons for doing this, such as jumping over a ball lodged in
                        your hoop after
                        a failed peel, or jumping over a hoop to try and hit another ball. Perhaps the most common
                        scenario for
                        playing a jump stroke is to try and run a very angled hoop (e.g. from over 40deg) - hitting down
                        onto your ball imparts extra forward spin, and
                        this can be useful to coax a ball through what would otherwise be considered an unrunnable hoop.
                    



By striking down on the the blue, it is rebounded into
                                the air with a lot of topspin


There are a number of ways to play the jump stroke, depending on how high, and how sharply, you
                        need your
                        ball to rise off the ground. In general, the more sharply you hit down onto your ball, the
                        steeper the jump
                        angle. If you played the stroke with a fairly shallow downward angle, then the ball would rise
                        more
                        gradually over a longer distance compared to playing the stroke with sharper and more pronounced
                        downward angle. 
When using a jump shot to run a hoop, the most important thing is to miss the near wire of the
                        hoop. The additional topspin imparted by the jump shot will deter the ball from rebounding when
                        it makes contact with the hoop upright, and instead will keep spinning forwards and (hopefully)
                        through the hoop.
Back to top




Sweep Shot
A sweep shot is used to get out of a hampered situation, normally after running a hoop and not having a clean swing at the reception ball.  It is played while kneeling on the court with the mallet held horizontally across the body, one hand near (but not touching) the mallet head and the other hand closer to the top of the handle.



Sweep shot after blue has run the hoop, hampered from red


The swing is in an arc shape, and is played in such a way that the hand closest to the mallet head will be moving forwards when the top hand is moving backwards, in a lever motion.  As a result, when the mallet face contacts the ball, it hits across the ball horizontally, imparting a small amount of side spin.  This in turn will help the ball curve slightly in the direction towards the intended target.  The line of aim should be at the outside edge of the target ball.
It is a shot worth practising both left-handed and right-handed, because either method may be required during a game, depending on the side of the hoop the mallet needs to swing.
There are a number of faults to look out for when playing a sweep shot, and some common ones include
                    
Touching the mallet head
Resting your arm on your leg
Resting a hand or arm on the ground
Hitting the ball with the corner of the mallet face


Back to top




Cannon
A cannon is a shot involving 3 (or occasionally 4) balls.  The most common cannon is the Corner 1 cannon, where three balls will all be in the corner, each ball in contact with one other ball.  
A common scenario where a cannon might arise is when the striker rushes a ball into the corner area when there is already a ball on the corner spot.  The roqueted ball is lined back onto the court, in contact with the existing corner ball, on either boundary.  At that point the existing corner ball can be moved to any position around the roqueted ball in contact with it.  As the striker made a roquet, they must take croquet from the roqueted ball.  The striker's ball must not be in contact with the existing corner ball.
If the striker's ball is for hoop 1, then the aim of the Corner 1 cannon would be to croquet a pioneer ball towards hoop 2, and in the same shot roquet the third ball, rushing it to hoop 1.  This may sound somewhat complicated, but once you break it down it is actually fairly simple.





Blue rushes black into the corner square.  Red is a corner ball.  Black is replaced on the yardline in contact with red.

Exact line of aim will need to be adjusted for the player's mallet characteristics - generally a heavier mallet which is better at rolls would aim somewhere near hoop 6 whereas a light mallet that is good for stop shots would aim nearer to hoop 5.  For most players, it would be somewhere between the two.  The stroke is normally played as a drive, but again could be slightly adjusted depending upon mallet characteristics.

Technique

        It is of utmost importance to develop a good technique - it acts as the
        basis for every shot you play, so if you can spend some time working on
        developing a consistent technique, then every shot you play will see a
        benefit.
      

        This section talks about the key concepts involved in holding a mallet
        and hitting a croquet ball. For more information on technique as it
        applies to specific shots in the game, then see the
        Shots section.
      
Grips and Style

        How to hold a mallet is the most obvious thing to learn. Although no two
        grips are the same, fundamentally there are 3 main choices:
      

Standard Grip
Irish Grip
Solomon Grip


        Which grip you choose will mainly depend on comfort. Often the best way
        to choose a grip is to pick up a mallet without any instruction and
        swing it - you will usually pick one of the above grips without even
        realising it. Once you have found your most comfortable grip, then you
        can go about fine-tuning it. Whatever grip you choose, it is recommended
        to have your hands as close together as possible. The reason for this is
        that in order to develop a smooth, consistent pendulum swing, both hands
        must work together. If the hands are split apart, then there is a
        tendency for them to work against each other, with one moving forwards
        while the other moves back during the swing - this can lead to
        inconsistent results.
      

        A right-handed player has their left hand at the top of the mallet, with
        their dominant hand below; conversely a left-handed player will have
        their right hand at the top. Interestingly there are a high number of
        "wrong-handed" players in croquet - who are right-handed but play
        left-handed, or vice versa - myself included.
      
Standard Grip

        So named because it is the most common grip, and without too much
        instruction it can give a good balance between power and control.
      

        The standard grip has the top hand with the knuckles facing outwards
        (away from your body) and the bottom hand with the knuckles facing
        inwards. Having the top hand knuckles facing outwards means that it is
        easier to generate power into shots, while having the bottom hand
        knuckles facing inwards means that the mallet is still easy to control
        and guide. It is important to ensure that both hands work together,
        despite facing in opposite directions.
      






                A left-handed standard grip demonstrated by Jarrod Coutts
              








                Harps Tahurangi with a right-handed standard grip
              





        Some players feel more comfortable placing the thumb of the top hand on
        the top of the handle, whereas others tend to wrap the thumb around the
        handle itself. Variations can also be found with the index fingers of
        the bottom hand, with most players extending it down the handle to act
        as a guide.
      

        Over years of playing, I have adapted my standard grip - I now play with
        the thumb of the top hand on top of the handle, as I used to find that I
        was more prone to twisting the mallet if the thumb was simply wrapped
        around the handle.
      

        At every level, the standard grip is still the most commonly used.
        Examples of top players who use this grip are multiple World Champions
        Reg Bamford and Chris Clarke.
      
Irish Grip

        This grip has the palms of both hands facing outwards, somewhat similar
        to how you hold a golf club. It is a very accurate grip and great for
        judging distances and control. On the other hand, many players find it
        difficult to get power into their shots with this grip. It can be quite
        hard on the wrists, particularly for the top hand, but this can be
        alleviated somewhat with a shorter mallet handle.

        Many top players favour this grip, and examples include World Champions
        Robert Fulford and Stephen Mulliner.
      
Solomon Grip

        This grip is named after one of the greatest ever players, John Solomon.
        The story goes that he started playing croquet as a small child and the
        only way that he could grip the mallet (which was as tall as he was) was
        with the knuckles of both hands facing outwards. As he developed into a
        top player over the years, his grip remained the same. Nowadays the
        Solomon grip is a very popular grip and is particularly good for
        generating a lot of power. It can take a while to master as it does not
        have the guiding bottom hand to help control the forward swing, however
        once mastered it is very accurate indeed.

        Some of the best single-ball shot players of all time have favoured this
        grip - among them David Maugham and Jamie Burch.
      

Other grips and variations


Penholder

            This grip is a variation on the Solomon grip, but tends to be
            referred to in its own right. The knuckles of both hands face
            outwards just as with Solomon, but the bottom hand grips the handle
            with the fingers / fingertips instead of the whole palm of the hand.
            Generally the hands are also slightly separated. Some players find
            this a very natural grip to play with.

                David Goacher demonstrates a split-hands grip
              




Split hand variation

            Despite everything written above, the split hand variation is still
            one of the most commonly-used grips. Although I would not recommend
            this for the majority of players, if you can avoid the tendency for
            the hands to work against one another, then it is still possible to
            develop a consistent swing using this variation. It gives a very
            stable platform and due to the bottom hand being a long way down the
            handle it gives good control over the mallet without too much
            effort.
          



Centre-style vs Side-style
Fundamentally there are two distinct playing styles in croquet:

Centre-style, where the mallet is swung between the feet
Side-style, where the mallet is swung outside the body


        Side style was once more popular in the days when women played
        competitive sport while wearing dresses. These days are long gone, and
        hence it is relatively rare to see croquet played side-style today. One
        distinct advantage that can be had from playing side-style is that of
        power - the mallet is swung outside of the body, and so the backswing is
        uninhibited. Most players do, however, find it harder to aim with this
        technique. One of Australia's top players, Stephen Forster, plays very
        successfully with a side-style technique, and is one of the most
        accurate break players in the game.
      




            Stephen Forster is the best side-style player in the world
          



        Centre-style is a universally accepted way to play croquet today, and
        most beginners would not even be shown anything else when they are
        learning. However if you have experimented with the various grips
        outlined above and are still struggling to get enough power into the
        shot, then side style is an option open to you.
      

        The rest of this section is written on the assumption of centre-style.
      

Pre-Shot Routine and Stance
Stalking the ball

        The single most important part of the aiming process is the stalk. This
        is the process of walking up to the striker's ball in a direct line of
        where you intend to aim. For long roquet attempts, the stalk may be 10
        yards or more.
      






                Greg Bryant stalks a long roquet
              








                Reg Bamford shows that even the simplest of shots requires
                stalking
              





        For shorter shots, such as running short hoops, it is still really
        important to go through the stalk routine (although maybe 2-3 yards
        would suffice there). It may at first be a difficult habit to get into,
        but it is absolutely fundamental for finding the correct line - it
        enables your body to be lined up correctly with the intended destination
        of the ball.
      




            Stephen Mulliner is renowned for taking stalking to the extreme
          



        Once the stalk has been completed, no further tweaking of the aiming
        line should be done - doing so will only serve to misalign your body
        position with the mallet and lead to a miss. Many players however will
        choose to swing over the ball several times (called casting), which,
        among other things, can help to reassure that their aim is correct. If
        the aim is found to be incorrect, you should re-stalk the ball at that
        point.
      
Stance

        As a general rule, after placing the mallet head just behind the ball
        before taking a shot, you should stand with your toes about level with
        the back of the mallet head. This will not only enable more power, but
        also encourage a fuller swing that uses the arms and not just the
        wrists. A mistake often made by beginners is to stand too close to the
        ball - doing so, they will find that it is hard to generate enough power
        into the shot, and also difficult to find the aiming line.
      

        The feet can be level with one another, or staggered, with one foot in
        the normal position of having the toes level with the back of the
        mallet, and the other foot 6-12 inches further back. Staggering the feet
        provides stability and can help to prevent body movement during the
        shot. As a rule, right-handed players would stand with the right foot
        slightly further back, and vice versa for left-handed players. This can
        help to free up the swing so that the player's leg does not interfere
        with the bottom hand during the backswing. Again there are notable
        exceptions to this rule, such as double world champion Chris Clarke, who
        plays right handed, but with the right foot further forward than the
        left.
      

        For me personally, for single ball shots I stand with my feet
        approximately level as I have found this to be most accurate.
      

Swing

        Mechanically speaking, a croquet swing is quite simple, as it is
        generally done inline with the body. A good croquet swing should be like
        a pendulum, and should have a slow, unhurried backswing and smooth
        forward swing.
      
Casting vs stationary

        Many players prefer to "cast" over the ball - that is, to swing the
        mallet back and forth over the top of the striker's ball - before
        hitting it - they do this to assist with aiming and also to ensure that
        their swing is smooth and already in motion before making contact with
        the ball. Most top-level players do some form of casting - good examples
        of this are Robert Fulford, David Maugham and Greg Bryant. However, it
        is not necessary to cast in order to play well - players like Reg
        Bamford and Jose Riva address the ball from a stationary position and
        simply take one swing to hit the ball.
      




            Jamie Burch is a picture of concentration while casting
          



        Irish Grip players do tend to cast more than others, and probably the
        main reason for this is that the backswing is appreciably more difficult
        with the Irish grip, and so casting enables the swing to gradually build
        to a moving position before striking the ball.
      

        Experiment with both the casting and non-casting methods to find what
        works for you.
      
Arc of the swing

        Ideally the fewer muscles involved in the croquet swing, the better.
        That is why it is recommended to swing the mallet from the shoulders,
        minimising wrist and elbow movement. This means that the swing will be
        done, for the most part, by the larger muscles, while the smaller
        muscles in the wrist that can cause the mallet to twist, are not flexed.
        In reality, very few players play with a fully shoulder-driven swing as
        it would feel quite unnatural, but there is still some merit in
        minimising wrist movement in particular. It is worth noting that many
        very good players have wristy swings - Robert Fulford is a prime example
        of this.
      




            Robert Fulford, one of the greatest players ever, has a wrist-driven
            swing
          




        While there are lot of mechanics and variables involved in a wristy
        swing, the key to developing into a good player is to build consistency
        in whatever swing you use. Having more variables in the swing means that
        there is theoretically more to go wrong, but if you find a more wrist or
        elbow-driven swing comfortable and you are able to play a wide range of
        shots with it, then my advice would be to practise hard with it so that
        it becomes as repeatable as possible.
      
Hitting the ball

        Hitting the ball with the mallet - the key component to playing good
        croquet. It is fair to say that this skill is easy to learn but
        difficult to master. To strike one's own ball correctly, in the centre
        of the mallet face every time will bring great consistency to your game.
        In order to do so, the rest of your technique up to this point must be
        consistent.
      

        During your backswing before hitting the ball, you should be
        focusing only on your ball, and upon making contact with the ball,
        resisting the temptation to lift your head to check where the ball has
        gone. This is a key part of striking the ball consistently - if you lift
        your head as you make contact with the ball, it can raise the shoulders
        and the arms, and result in an inconsistent strike and consequently a
        missed roquet. A croquet swing is fundamentally simple, particularly
        when compared to complex swings found in golf, and you should do
        everything you can to keep it that way by avoiding introducing
        unnecessary variables such as body movement that can lead to a miss.
      

        While players who cast over the ball may be reassured that their aim is correct, beware that
        too much emphasis spent on working out the aiming line can lead to less
        focus on the main element of actually playing a shot, which is of course striking your ball with
        the mallet in the centre of the mallet face.  When casting, ensure that by the time you are taking your final backswing, you are focussed solely on the striker's ball, and on striking it cleanly.  
      




            Reg Bamford with typical rock-solid technique
          



        The forward swing should not be forced, but rather should continue at
        the same pace as that of the backswing. The strength of the shot
        therefore should be determined by the height of the backswing, not the
        force of the forward swing. When the mallet reaches the top of the
        backswing, gravity should be the main force moving the mallet forwards,
        with the hands and arms mainly serving to guide the mallet on its way
        through. If the forward swing is forced, then it means that muscles are
        being used to propel the mallet forward, which can result in twisting.
      
Putting it all together

        A picture is worth a thousand words; a video is worth a thousand
        pictures. Below is a video showing two 5-time world champions (Reg
        Bamford and Robert Fulford) hitting a croquet ball. Note that although
        their individual styles are quite contrasting, they both incorporate
        everything discussed above - the stalking of the ball; taking their
        stance well back from the ball; the smooth, unhurried swing; keeping
        their head down until after the ball has been struck.

Shots
To borrow from John Prince's croquet video, "A famous player once remarked that hitting one's own
                        ball
                        correctly was the only difficult thing in croquet". 
Below you will find an overview of the shots involved in croquet, and some high-level guidance on how
                    to achieve them. More detailed information on specific strokes may also be found in the Technique section
If you have read the introduction section, or are already somewhat familiar with croquet, then you
                    will
                    realise that there are two basic types of stroke involved - single ball strokes and croquet
                    strokes.

Single-ball strokes

Roquet
A roquet is the act of hitting your ball onto another ball.  A roquet can be made at any distance, be it the length of the court, or from just a few inches.  Most of what is written in the Technique section covers how to play with a technique that you would use to make a roquet.
To reiterate, it is important to develop a smooth, unhurried swing.  The best way to do this is to stand far enough back from the ball so that your swing is free and you can clearly see the aiming line.  Finding the aiming line is easier if you are able to see your own ball and also the target ball in your peripheral vision, and therefore when you have taken your stance, your head should not be any further forward than the back of the striker's ball.  Once the aiming has been completed, the only thought should then be on striking your own ball with the centre of the mallet, and keeping your head down throughout the strike.



A roquet should be hit with a smooth strike and the mallet should be flat upon impact with the ball


Remember to ensure that whatever technique you use, it should be the same for roquets of any distance.  A good practice routine for roqueting is to take two sets of balls, and place each set 4-5 yards apart.  Take 4 shots.  If you hit them all, then extend the range to 5 yards and repeat.  Keep extending the range by a yard each time.

Rush
Not exactly what the name implies, there is nothing hurried about a rush! A rush is simply a
                        roquet but from
                        short range - indeed, sometimes a rush is referred to as a "roquet-rush". What sets a rush apart
                        from a
                        normal roquet is that instead of just trying to hit the target ball (as with a roquet), the aim
                        of the rush
                        is to send the target ball to a specific spot or area so that the next shot (a croquet stroke) is
                        played from
                        as easy a place as possible. 



A short rush. Notice that the mallet is parallel to the
                                    ground at
                                    point of contact


An example of this might be when your ball is 1-foot away from
                        another ball and
                        you would attempt to roquet the ball so that it stops near to your current hoop - from there you
                        could play
                        your croquet stroke from a position that is already close to your hoop!
A rush that is not in a straight line is referred to as a "cut rush", whereby you aim at a point on the object ball that is off-centre.  In exactly the same concept as in snooker or pool, when the centre of your ball hits the spot on the object ball, the object ball will travel in a direction in line with that spot.

The key to being a good croquet player is to avoid having to play difficult shots very often.
                        Mastering the
                        rush is a key part of achieving this goal.

Hoop Shot
When running a hoop, the same principle applies as with making a roquet. It is particularly
                        important here to
                        observe a smooth follow-through, because this will enable the ball to be imparted with natural
                        forward-spin
                        so that the ball is rolling - not skidding - when it reaches the hoop. Any minor misjudgement of
                        direction
                        of the shot may be alleviated by the forward spin that has been imparted. Conversely it you were
                        to jab at
                        the ball with a quick stabbing motion, it would negate any natural forward spin and cause the
                        ball to skid
                        along the ground - this can result in the ball stopping and sticking in the hoop upon contact
                        with the
                        hoop upright.
When running hoops from an angle, the key thing to remember is that the ball must miss the "near wire"
                        (the hoop upright closest to the ball) in order to run the hoop. Even a light brush against the
                        near wire will result in a failed hoop



Running an angled hoop.  The shot on the left will fail because the centre of the ball is aimed at the centre of the gap.  The shot on the right will succeed because the edge of the ball is aimed to just miss the near upright of the hoop.


While it is true that topspin can help a ball run a hoop, you must avoid the temptation to apply additional topspin via hitting down on the ball - doing so is likely to lead to inaccuracy with direction and also loss of control, and should
                        be reserved for only extreme angles where running the hoop would otherwise be very doubtful.

Croquet strokes

Takeoff
While the takeoff is technically a croquet stroke, in reality it is played in the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke. The main purpose of the takeoff is to position the striker's ball for its continuation
                        stroke, and
                        leave the croqueted ball more-or-less where it is. When playing the takeoff, you must remember
                        that the
                        croqueted ball has to move, otherwise it will not be a valid croquet stroke and incur
                        end-of-turn.

Blue plays a "thick" takeoff from red
                                



You can play a takeoff from either side of the croqueted ball. The amount by which the croqueted
                        ball moves
                        is determined by the angle towards the object ball at which you hit - a small inward angle will
                        result in what is
                        called a "fine" or "thin" takeoff, whereby the croqueted ball just moves maybe an inch or two.
                        If you hit in towards
                        the croqueted ball more, then more momentum will be transferred into it, moving it more -
                        resulting in
                        what's known as a "thick takeoff".
Note also that some natural side-spin will be imparted on the striker's ball due to having been
                        in contact
                        with the croqueted ball. After the striker's ball is struck, and as it slows down, it will curve
                        inwards
                        slightly, in the same direction that which the croqueted ball had been on.
Back to top




Stop Shot
The stop shot is a croquet stroke which causes the striker's ball to move the shortest
                        distance in
                        relation to the croqueted ball. This is achieved by hitting slightly underneath the
                        centreline of
                        your ball, countering the natural forward spin which would be imparted when playing a normal
                        stroke. The
                        mallet is grounded upon impacting the ball and there is no follow-through. Because the mallet head is angled upward (as shown in the image), the mallet handle is angled slightly further back than normal, so in order to play the stop shot comfortably, you should stand with your feet slightly further back than you would for a normal stroke.
                       





Note the upward angle of the mallet face

Depending on the lawn, balls and mallet weight, ratios of anywhere between 1:5 and 1:10 (and
                        sometimes even
                        higher) can be achieved with a stop shot. It is a good idea to practise and become very familiar
                        with your
                        stop shot ratio, as the easiest way to play a well-controlled break is through the use of
                        accurate stop
                        shots and drives.
Although playing a stop shot is easy, a good technique is required to achieve a good ratio. Essentially the only shot where a smooth strike is unhelpful, it can take a while to master the timing involved in grounding the mallet at the exact moment of impact with the ball.
As mentioned above, you should stand further back from the ball when playing a stop shot because the whole mallet is angled slightly back.  Placement of the feet on this shot varies - some player will take a half-step back with both
                        feet, whereas others will keep one foot in the normal position with the other further behind,
                        rocking onto the back foot to achieve the same result.

Drive
The drive is the simplest croquet stroke to play, as it is played exactly the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke - with a normal stance and a normal follow through. Although the ratio will always vary
                        depending on
                        a number of factors (lawn, ball composition and mallet weight), the standard ratio achieved with
                        a drive is
                        about 1:3.



The drive is played like a single-ball stroke
                            


As with the stop shot, it is important to develop a consistent and repeatable drive ratio,
                        because these two
                        strokes are the basis of solid and controlled break play.

Half Roll
The half roll is played by hitting slightly downwards onto your ball - this imparts a small
                        amount of extra
                        forward spin compared to a drive, enabling a ratio of about 1:2. In order to play the stroke
                        comfortably,
                        you should stand further forward than for a normal stroke, with your feet (or at least your
                        front foot)
                        about level with the striker's ball. Because you are standing closer to the ball than normal on this shot, moving both your hands down the mallet somewhat will make the shot easier to play, as it will give more control over the mallet and also make the backswing easier.  



The mallet strikes blue at a downward angle
                                to impart
                                additional topspin, increasing the distance blue travels


The half roll can easily be played centre-style, however some players choose to play this stroke
                        side-style
                        in order to generate more power.

Full Roll
The full roll is a croquet stroke where both balls travel approximately the same distance. It is
                        often used
                        as a recovery stroke. In order to get the
                        striker's ball
                        to travel the same distance as the croqueted ball, a lot of forward spin is needed to be
                        imparted on the
                        striker's ball - to achieve this, your hands need to drop a lot further down the mallet than
                        normal, and
                        the mallet should impact the striker's ball at a steeper angle than for a half roll.



The mallet strikes blue at a steep angle,
                                imparting high
                                topspin and causing both balls to travel a similar distance.


The full roll is often played side-style in order to generate enough power in the stroke.
                        However, if the
                        player has good timing and technique, it is possible to play this stroke centre-style. 
Back to top




Pass Roll
The pass roll is similar to the full roll, but the striker's ball travels even further than the croqueted ball. In order to achieve this, even more forward spin is required - as a consequence, the hands need to drop even further down
                        the mallet
                        than for the full roll. The pass roll needs to be played with more punch than the full roll, meaning that the mallet head must still be in the process of accellerating at the moment it makes contact with the ball.  To help achieve this, you can shorten the backswing and apply additional force to the forward swing.  
                    



The mallet strikes blue at an acute angle,
                                creating
                                maximum topspin


Like the full roll, the pass roll is often played side-style in order to generate the power and "punch" required to apply such topspin.  Because of the steep downward angle of the mallet
                        required to generate the necessary forward spin means standing very far forward, playing this stroke
                        centre-style will
                        give a very restricted backswing.  The placement of the bottom hand should be very close to the mallet head, but beware that touching the mallet head during the stroke is a fault.

Split Shot
A split shot is not a croquet stroke in its own right, but rather a variation of the croquet
                        strokes listed above. It can apply to anything from a stop shot through to a pass roll, and
                        refers to playing a croquet stroke where both balls go in different directions.



Line of aim is halfway between the two
                                intended destination points


For a given croquet stroke, the player should line the two balls up in a line of where they wish
                        the object ball to be sent. After determining the intended destination point for the striker's ball, you must aim at a point halfway between the two. The croqueted ball will actually "pull" slightly in the direction which you are playing the stroke, so some allowance needs to be made for that when lining up the two balls.
The wider the angle of split, the less "roll" (topspin) is required to be applied to the striker's
                        ball to get it to travel a given distance - knowing the amount of roll to apply comes with practice.

Special Shots
There are various shots that crop up during a game which are needed to recover from particular situations, such as when you have run a hoop but have a hampered backswing - and deserve special mention.  

Jump Shot
The jump stroke is a single-ball stroke in which you hit downwards onto your ball, causing it to
                        jump into
                        the air. There are a number of reasons for doing this, such as jumping over a ball lodged in
                        your hoop after
                        a failed peel, or jumping over a hoop to try and hit another ball. Perhaps the most common
                        scenario for
                        playing a jump stroke is to try and run a very angled hoop (e.g. from over 40deg) - hitting down
                        onto your ball imparts extra forward spin, and
                        this can be useful to coax a ball through what would otherwise be considered an unrunnable hoop.
                    



By striking down on the the blue, it is rebounded into
                                the air with a lot of topspin


There are a number of ways to play the jump stroke, depending on how high, and how sharply, you
                        need your
                        ball to rise off the ground. In general, the more sharply you hit down onto your ball, the
                        steeper the jump
                        angle. If you played the stroke with a fairly shallow downward angle, then the ball would rise
                        more
                        gradually over a longer distance compared to playing the stroke with sharper and more pronounced
                        downward angle. 
When using a jump shot to run a hoop, the most important thing is to miss the near wire of the
                        hoop. The additional topspin imparted by the jump shot will deter the ball from rebounding when
                        it makes contact with the hoop upright, and instead will keep spinning forwards and (hopefully)
                        through the hoop.

Sweep Shot
A sweep shot is used to get out of a hampered situation, normally after running a hoop and not having a clean swing at the reception ball.  It is played while kneeling on the court with the mallet held horizontally across the body, one hand near (but not touching) the mallet head and the other hand closer to the top of the handle.



Sweep shot after blue has run the hoop, hampered from red


The swing is in an arc shape, and is played in such a way that the hand closest to the mallet head will be moving forwards when the top hand is moving backwards, in a lever motion.  As a result, when the mallet face contacts the ball, it hits across the ball horizontally, imparting a small amount of side spin.  This in turn will help the ball curve slightly in the direction towards the intended target.  The line of aim should be at the outside edge of the target ball.
It is a shot worth practising both left-handed and right-handed, because either method may be required during a game, depending on the side of the hoop the mallet needs to swing.
There are a number of faults to look out for when playing a sweep shot, and some common ones include
                    
Touching the mallet head
Resting your arm on your leg
Resting a hand or arm on the ground
Hitting the ball with the corner of the mallet face


Back to top




Cannon
A cannon is a shot involving 3 (or occasionally 4) balls.  The most common cannon is the Corner 1 cannon, where three balls will all be in the corner, each ball in contact with one other ball.  
A common scenario where a cannon might arise is when the striker rushes a ball into the corner area when there is already a ball on the corner spot.  The roqueted ball is lined back onto the court, in contact with the existing corner ball, on either boundary.  At that point the existing corner ball can be moved to any position around the roqueted ball in contact with it.  As the striker made a roquet, they must take croquet from the roqueted ball.  The striker's ball must not be in contact with the existing corner ball.
If the striker's ball is for hoop 1, then the aim of the Corner 1 cannon would be to croquet a pioneer ball towards hoop 2, and in the same shot roquet the third ball, rushing it to hoop 1.  This may sound somewhat complicated, but once you break it down it is actually fairly simple.





Blue rushes black into the corner square.  Red is a corner ball.  Black is replaced on the yardline in contact with red.

Exact line of aim will need to be adjusted for the player's mallet characteristics - generally a heavier mallet which is better at rolls would aim somewhere near hoop 6 whereas a light mallet that is good for stop shots would aim nearer to hoop 5.  For most players, it would be somewhere between the two.  The stroke is normally played as a drive, but again could be slightly adjusted depending upon mallet characteristics.

Shots
To borrow from John Prince's croquet video, "A famous player once remarked that hitting one's own
                        ball
                        correctly was the only difficult thing in croquet". 
Below you will find an overview of the shots involved in croquet, and some high-level guidance on how
                    to achieve them. More detailed information on specific strokes may also be found in the Technique section
If you have read the introduction section, or are already somewhat familiar with croquet, then you
                    will
                    realise that there are two basic types of stroke involved - single ball strokes and croquet
                    strokes.

Single-ball strokes

Roquet
A roquet is the act of hitting your ball onto another ball.  A roquet can be made at any distance, be it the length of the court, or from just a few inches.  Most of what is written in the Technique section covers how to play with a technique that you would use to make a roquet.
To reiterate, it is important to develop a smooth, unhurried swing.  The best way to do this is to stand far enough back from the ball so that your swing is free and you can clearly see the aiming line.  Finding the aiming line is easier if you are able to see your own ball and also the target ball in your peripheral vision, and therefore when you have taken your stance, your head should not be any further forward than the back of the striker's ball.  Once the aiming has been completed, the only thought should then be on striking your own ball with the centre of the mallet, and keeping your head down throughout the strike.



A roquet should be hit with a smooth strike and the mallet should be flat upon impact with the ball


Remember to ensure that whatever technique you use, it should be the same for roquets of any distance.  A good practice routine for roqueting is to take two sets of balls, and place each set 4-5 yards apart.  Take 4 shots.  If you hit them all, then extend the range to 5 yards and repeat.  Keep extending the range by a yard each time.

Rush
Not exactly what the name implies, there is nothing hurried about a rush! A rush is simply a
                        roquet but from
                        short range - indeed, sometimes a rush is referred to as a "roquet-rush". What sets a rush apart
                        from a
                        normal roquet is that instead of just trying to hit the target ball (as with a roquet), the aim
                        of the rush
                        is to send the target ball to a specific spot or area so that the next shot (a croquet stroke) is
                        played from
                        as easy a place as possible. 



A short rush. Notice that the mallet is parallel to the
                                    ground at
                                    point of contact


An example of this might be when your ball is 1-foot away from
                        another ball and
                        you would attempt to roquet the ball so that it stops near to your current hoop - from there you
                        could play
                        your croquet stroke from a position that is already close to your hoop!
A rush that is not in a straight line is referred to as a "cut rush", whereby you aim at a point on the object ball that is off-centre.  In exactly the same concept as in snooker or pool, when the centre of your ball hits the spot on the object ball, the object ball will travel in a direction in line with that spot.



A cut rush to send red to a particular spot


The key to being a good croquet player is to avoid having to play difficult shots very often.
                        Mastering the
                        rush is a key part of achieving this goal.

Hoop Shot
When running a hoop, the same principle applies as with making a roquet. It is particularly
                        important here to
                        observe a smooth follow-through, because this will enable the ball to be imparted with natural
                        forward-spin
                        so that the ball is rolling - not skidding - when it reaches the hoop. Any minor misjudgement of
                        direction
                        of the shot may be alleviated by the forward spin that has been imparted. Conversely it you were
                        to jab at
                        the ball with a quick stabbing motion, it would negate any natural forward spin and cause the
                        ball to skid
                        along the ground - this can result in the ball stopping and sticking in the hoop upon contact
                        with the
                        hoop upright.
When running hoops from an angle, the key thing to remember is that the ball must miss the "near wire"
                        (the hoop upright closest to the ball) in order to run the hoop. Even a light brush against the
                        near wire will result in a failed hoop



Running an angled hoop.  The shot on the left will fail because the centre of the ball is aimed at the centre of the gap.  The shot on the right will succeed because the edge of the ball is aimed to just miss the near upright of the hoop.


While it is true that topspin can help a ball run a hoop, you must avoid the temptation to apply additional topspin via hitting down on the ball - doing so is likely to lead to inaccuracy with direction and also loss of control, and should
                        be reserved for only extreme angles where running the hoop would otherwise be very doubtful.

Croquet strokes

Takeoff
While the takeoff is technically a croquet stroke, in reality it is played in the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke. The main purpose of the takeoff is to position the striker's ball for its continuation
                        stroke, and
                        leave the croqueted ball more-or-less where it is. When playing the takeoff, you must remember
                        that the
                        croqueted ball has to move, otherwise it will not be a valid croquet stroke and incur
                        end-of-turn.

Blue plays a "thick" takeoff from red
                                



You can play a takeoff from either side of the croqueted ball. The amount by which the croqueted
                        ball moves
                        is determined by the angle towards the object ball at which you hit - a small inward angle will
                        result in what is
                        called a "fine" or "thin" takeoff, whereby the croqueted ball just moves maybe an inch or two.
                        If you hit in towards
                        the croqueted ball more, then more momentum will be transferred into it, moving it more -
                        resulting in
                        what's known as a "thick takeoff".
Note also that some natural side-spin will be imparted on the striker's ball due to having been
                        in contact
                        with the croqueted ball. After the striker's ball is struck, and as it slows down, it will curve
                        inwards
                        slightly, in the same direction that which the croqueted ball had been on.
Back to top




Stop Shot
The stop shot is a croquet stroke which causes the striker's ball to move the shortest
                        distance in
                        relation to the croqueted ball. This is achieved by hitting slightly underneath the
                        centreline of
                        your ball, countering the natural forward spin which would be imparted when playing a normal
                        stroke. The
                        mallet is grounded upon impacting the ball and there is no follow-through. Because the mallet head is angled upward (as shown in the image), the mallet handle is angled slightly further back than normal, so in order to play the stop shot comfortably, you should stand with your feet slightly further back than you would for a normal stroke.
                       





Note the upward angle of the mallet face

Depending on the lawn, balls and mallet weight, ratios of anywhere between 1:5 and 1:10 (and
                        sometimes even
                        higher) can be achieved with a stop shot. It is a good idea to practise and become very familiar
                        with your
                        stop shot ratio, as the easiest way to play a well-controlled break is through the use of
                        accurate stop
                        shots and drives.
Although playing a stop shot is easy, a good technique is required to achieve a good ratio. Essentially the only shot where a smooth strike is unhelpful, it can take a while to master the timing involved in grounding the mallet at the exact moment of impact with the ball.
As mentioned above, you should stand further back from the ball when playing a stop shot because the whole mallet is angled slightly back.  Placement of the feet on this shot varies - some player will take a half-step back with both
                        feet, whereas others will keep one foot in the normal position with the other further behind,
                        rocking onto the back foot to achieve the same result.

Drive
The drive is the simplest croquet stroke to play, as it is played exactly the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke - with a normal stance and a normal follow through. Although the ratio will always vary
                        depending on
                        a number of factors (lawn, ball composition and mallet weight), the standard ratio achieved with
                        a drive is
                        about 1:3.



The drive is played like a single-ball stroke
                            


As with the stop shot, it is important to develop a consistent and repeatable drive ratio,
                        because these two
                        strokes are the basis of solid and controlled break play.
                    
Back to top




Half Roll
The half roll is played by hitting slightly downwards onto your ball - this imparts a small
                        amount of extra
                        forward spin compared to a drive, enabling a ratio of about 1:2. In order to play the stroke
                        comfortably,
                        you should stand further forward than for a normal stroke, with your feet (or at least your
                        front foot)
                        about level with the striker's ball. Because you are standing closer to the ball than normal on this shot, moving both your hands down the mallet somewhat will make the shot easier to play, as it will give more control over the mallet and also make the backswing easier.

                                to impart
                                additional topspin, increasing the distance blue travels


The half roll can easily be played centre-style, however some players choose to play this stroke
                        side-style
                        in order to generate more power.

Full Roll
The full roll is a croquet stroke where both balls travel approximately the same distance. It is
                        often used
                        as a recovery stroke. In order to get the
                        striker's ball
                        to travel the same distance as the croqueted ball, a lot of forward spin is needed to be
                        imparted on the
                        striker's ball - to achieve this, your hands need to drop a lot further down the mallet than
                        normal, and
                        the mallet should impact the striker's ball at a steeper angle than for a half roll.

                                imparting high
                                topspin and causing both balls to travel a similar distance.


The full roll is often played side-style in order to generate enough power in the stroke.
                        However, if the
                        player has good timing and technique, it is possible to play this stroke centre-style.

Pass Roll
The pass roll is similar to the full roll, but the striker's ball travels even further than the croqueted ball. In order to achieve this, even more forward spin is required - as a consequence, the hands need to drop even further down
                        the mallet
                        than for the full roll. The pass roll needs to be played with more punch than the full roll, meaning that the mallet head must still be in the process of accellerating at the moment it makes contact with the ball.  To help achieve this, you can shorten the backswing and apply additional force to the forward swing.  
                    



The mallet strikes blue at an acute angle,
                                creating
                                maximum topspin


Like the full roll, the pass roll is often played side-style in order to generate the power and "punch" required to apply such topspin.  Because of the steep downward angle of the mallet
                        required to generate the necessary forward spin means standing very far forward, playing this stroke
                        centre-style will
                        give a very restricted backswing.  The placement of the bottom hand should be very close to the mallet head, but beware that touching the mallet head during the stroke is a fault.

Split Shot
A split shot is not a croquet stroke in its own right, but rather a variation of the croquet
                        strokes listed above. It can apply to anything from a stop shot through to a pass roll, and
                        refers to playing a croquet stroke where both balls go in different directions.



Line of aim is halfway between the two
                                intended destination points


For a given croquet stroke, the player should line the two balls up in a line of where they wish
                        the object ball to be sent. After determining the intended destination point for the striker's ball, you must aim at a point halfway between the two. The croqueted ball will actually "pull" slightly in the direction which you are playing the stroke, so some allowance needs to be made for that when lining up the two balls.
The wider the angle of split, the less "roll" (topspin) is required to be applied to the striker's
                        ball to get it to travel a given distance - knowing the amount of roll to apply comes with practice.

Special Shots
There are various shots that crop up during a game which are needed to recover from particular situations, such as when you have run a hoop but have a hampered backswing - and deserve special mention.  

Jump Shot
The jump stroke is a single-ball stroke in which you hit downwards onto your ball, causing it to
                        jump into
                        the air. There are a number of reasons for doing this, such as jumping over a ball lodged in
                        your hoop after
                        a failed peel, or jumping over a hoop to try and hit another ball. Perhaps the most common
                        scenario for
                        playing a jump stroke is to try and run a very angled hoop (e.g. from over 40deg) - hitting down
                        onto your ball imparts extra forward spin, and
                        this can be useful to coax a ball through what would otherwise be considered an unrunnable hoop.
                    



By striking down on the the blue, it is rebounded into
                                the air with a lot of topspin


There are a number of ways to play the jump stroke, depending on how high, and how sharply, you
                        need your
                        ball to rise off the ground. In general, the more sharply you hit down onto your ball, the
                        steeper the jump
                        angle. If you played the stroke with a fairly shallow downward angle, then the ball would rise
                        more
                        gradually over a longer distance compared to playing the stroke with sharper and more pronounced
                        downward angle. 
When using a jump shot to run a hoop, the most important thing is to miss the near wire of the
                        hoop. The additional topspin imparted by the jump shot will deter the ball from rebounding when
                        it makes contact with the hoop upright, and instead will keep spinning forwards and (hopefully)
                        through the hoop.

Sweep Shot
A sweep shot is used to get out of a hampered situation, normally after running a hoop and not having a clean swing at the reception ball.  It is played while kneeling on the court with the mallet held horizontally across the body, one hand near (but not touching) the mallet head and the other hand closer to the top of the handle.



Sweep shot after blue has run the hoop, hampered from red


The swing is in an arc shape, and is played in such a way that the hand closest to the mallet head will be moving forwards when the top hand is moving backwards, in a lever motion.  As a result, when the mallet face contacts the ball, it hits across the ball horizontally, imparting a small amount of side spin.  This in turn will help the ball curve slightly in the direction towards the intended target.  The line of aim should be at the outside edge of the target ball.
It is a shot worth practising both left-handed and right-handed, because either method may be required during a game, depending on the side of the hoop the mallet needs to swing.
There are a number of faults to look out for when playing a sweep shot, and some common ones include
                    
Touching the mallet head
Resting your arm on your leg
Resting a hand or arm on the ground
Hitting the ball with the corner of the mallet face


Back to top




Cannon
A cannon is a shot involving 3 (or occasionally 4) balls.  The most common cannon is the Corner 1 cannon, where three balls will all be in the corner, each ball in contact with one other ball.  
A common scenario where a cannon might arise is when the striker rushes a ball into the corner area when there is already a ball on the corner spot.  The roqueted ball is lined back onto the court, in contact with the existing corner ball, on either boundary.  At that point the existing corner ball can be moved to any position around the roqueted ball in contact with it.  As the striker made a roquet, they must take croquet from the roqueted ball.  The striker's ball must not be in contact with the existing corner ball.
If the striker's ball is for hoop 1, then the aim of the Corner 1 cannon would be to croquet a pioneer ball towards hoop 2, and in the same shot roquet the third ball, rushing it to hoop 1.  This may sound somewhat complicated, but once you break it down it is actually fairly simple.





Blue rushes black into the corner square.  Red is a corner ball.  Black is replaced on the yardline in contact with red.

Exact line of aim will need to be adjusted for the player's mallet characteristics - generally a heavier mallet which is better at rolls would aim somewhere near hoop 6 whereas a light mallet that is good for stop shots would aim nearer to hoop 5.  For most players, it would be somewhere between the two.  The stroke is normally played as a drive, but again could be slightly adjusted depending upon mallet characteristics.

Shots
To borrow from John Prince's croquet video, "A famous player once remarked that hitting one's own
                        ball
                        correctly was the only difficult thing in croquet". 
Below you will find an overview of the shots involved in croquet, and some high-level guidance on how
                    to achieve them. More detailed information on specific strokes may also be found in the Technique section
If you have read the introduction section, or are already somewhat familiar with croquet, then you
                    will
                    realise that there are two basic types of stroke involved - single ball strokes and croquet
                    strokes.

Single-ball strokes

Roquet
A roquet is the act of hitting your ball onto another ball.  A roquet can be made at any distance, be it the length of the court, or from just a few inches.  Most of what is written in the Technique section covers how to play with a technique that you would use to make a roquet.
To reiterate, it is important to develop a smooth, unhurried swing.  The best way to do this is to stand far enough back from the ball so that your swing is free and you can clearly see the aiming line.  Finding the aiming line is easier if you are able to see your own ball and also the target ball in your peripheral vision, and therefore when you have taken your stance, your head should not be any further forward than the back of the striker's ball.  Once the aiming has been completed, the only thought should then be on striking your own ball with the centre of the mallet, and keeping your head down throughout the strike.



A roquet should be hit with a smooth strike and the mallet should be flat upon impact with the ball


Remember to ensure that whatever technique you use, it should be the same for roquets of any distance.  A good practice routine for roqueting is to take two sets of balls, and place each set 4-5 yards apart.  Take 4 shots.  If you hit them all, then extend the range to 5 yards and repeat.  Keep extending the range by a yard each time.

Rush
Not exactly what the name implies, there is nothing hurried about a rush! A rush is simply a
                        roquet but from
                        short range - indeed, sometimes a rush is referred to as a "roquet-rush". What sets a rush apart
                        from a
                        normal roquet is that instead of just trying to hit the target ball (as with a roquet), the aim
                        of the rush
                        is to send the target ball to a specific spot or area so that the next shot (a croquet stroke) is
                        played from
                        as easy a place as possible. 



A short rush. Notice that the mallet is parallel to the
                                    ground at
                                    point of contact


An example of this might be when your ball is 1-foot away from
                        another ball and
                        you would attempt to roquet the ball so that it stops near to your current hoop - from there you
                        could play
                        your croquet stroke from a position that is already close to your hoop!
A rush that is not in a straight line is referred to as a "cut rush", whereby you aim at a point on the object ball that is off-centre.  In exactly the same concept as in snooker or pool, when the centre of your ball hits the spot on the object ball, the object ball will travel in a direction in line with that spot.

The key to being a good croquet player is to avoid having to play difficult shots very often.
                        Mastering the
                        rush is a key part of achieving this goal.

Hoop Shot
When running a hoop, the same principle applies as with making a roquet. It is particularly
                        important here to
                        observe a smooth follow-through, because this will enable the ball to be imparted with natural
                        forward-spin
                        so that the ball is rolling - not skidding - when it reaches the hoop. Any minor misjudgement of
                        direction
                        of the shot may be alleviated by the forward spin that has been imparted. Conversely it you were
                        to jab at
                        the ball with a quick stabbing motion, it would negate any natural forward spin and cause the
                        ball to skid
                        along the ground - this can result in the ball stopping and sticking in the hoop upon contact
                        with the
                        hoop upright.
When running hoops from an angle, the key thing to remember is that the ball must miss the "near wire"
                        (the hoop upright closest to the ball) in order to run the hoop. Even a light brush against the
                        near wire will result in a failed hoop



Running an angled hoop.  The shot on the left will fail because the centre of the ball is aimed at the centre of the gap.  The shot on the right will succeed because the edge of the ball is aimed to just miss the near upright of the hoop.


While it is true that topspin can help a ball run a hoop, you must avoid the temptation to apply additional topspin via hitting down on the ball - doing so is likely to lead to inaccuracy with direction and also loss of control, and should
                        be reserved for only extreme angles where running the hoop would otherwise be very doubtful.

Croquet strokes

Takeoff
While the takeoff is technically a croquet stroke, in reality it is played in the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke. The main purpose of the takeoff is to position the striker's ball for its continuation
                        stroke, and
                        leave the croqueted ball more-or-less where it is. When playing the takeoff, you must remember
                        that the
                        croqueted ball has to move, otherwise it will not be a valid croquet stroke and incur
                        end-of-turn.

Blue plays a "thick" takeoff from red
                                



You can play a takeoff from either side of the croqueted ball. The amount by which the croqueted
                        ball moves
                        is determined by the angle towards the object ball at which you hit - a small inward angle will
                        result in what is
                        called a "fine" or "thin" takeoff, whereby the croqueted ball just moves maybe an inch or two.
                        If you hit in towards
                        the croqueted ball more, then more momentum will be transferred into it, moving it more -
                        resulting in
                        what's known as a "thick takeoff".
Note also that some natural side-spin will be imparted on the striker's ball due to having been
                        in contact
                        with the croqueted ball. After the striker's ball is struck, and as it slows down, it will curve
                        inwards
                        slightly, in the same direction that which the croqueted ball had been on.
Back to top




Stop Shot
The stop shot is a croquet stroke which causes the striker's ball to move the shortest
                        distance in
                        relation to the croqueted ball. This is achieved by hitting slightly underneath the
                        centreline of
                        your ball, countering the natural forward spin which would be imparted when playing a normal
                        stroke. The
                        mallet is grounded upon impacting the ball and there is no follow-through. Because the mallet head is angled upward (as shown in the image), the mallet handle is angled slightly further back than normal, so in order to play the stop shot comfortably, you should stand with your feet slightly further back than you would for a normal stroke.
                       





Note the upward angle of the mallet face

Depending on the lawn, balls and mallet weight, ratios of anywhere between 1:5 and 1:10 (and
                        sometimes even
                        higher) can be achieved with a stop shot. It is a good idea to practise and become very familiar
                        with your
                        stop shot ratio, as the easiest way to play a well-controlled break is through the use of
                        accurate stop
                        shots and drives.
Although playing a stop shot is easy, a good technique is required to achieve a good ratio. Essentially the only shot where a smooth strike is unhelpful, it can take a while to master the timing involved in grounding the mallet at the exact moment of impact with the ball.
As mentioned above, you should stand further back from the ball when playing a stop shot because the whole mallet is angled slightly back.  Placement of the feet on this shot varies - some player will take a half-step back with both
                        feet, whereas others will keep one foot in the normal position with the other further behind,
                        rocking onto the back foot to achieve the same result.

Drive
The drive is the simplest croquet stroke to play, as it is played exactly the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke - with a normal stance and a normal follow through. Although the ratio will always vary
                        depending on
                        a number of factors (lawn, ball composition and mallet weight), the standard ratio achieved with
                        a drive is
                        about 1:3.



The drive is played like a single-ball stroke
                            


As with the stop shot, it is important to develop a consistent and repeatable drive ratio,
                        because these two
                        strokes are the basis of solid and controlled break play.
                    
Back to top




Half Roll
The half roll is played by hitting slightly downwards onto your ball - this imparts a small
                        amount of extra
                        forward spin compared to a drive, enabling a ratio of about 1:2. In order to play the stroke
                        comfortably,
                        you should stand further forward than for a normal stroke, with your feet (or at least your
                        front foot)
                        about level with the striker's ball. Because you are standing closer to the ball than normal on this shot, moving both your hands down the mallet somewhat will make the shot easier to play, as it will give more control over the mallet and also make the backswing easier.  



The mallet strikes blue at a downward angle
                                to impart
                                additional topspin, increasing the distance blue travels


The half roll can easily be played centre-style, however some players choose to play this stroke
                        side-style
                        in order to generate more power.

Full Roll
The full roll is a croquet stroke where both balls travel approximately the same distance. It is
                        often used
                        as a recovery stroke. In order to get the
                        striker's ball
                        to travel the same distance as the croqueted ball, a lot of forward spin is needed to be
                        imparted on the
                        striker's ball - to achieve this, your hands need to drop a lot further down the mallet than
                        normal, and
                        the mallet should impact the striker's ball at a steeper angle than for a half roll.



The mallet strikes blue at a steep angle,
                                imparting high
                                topspin and causing both balls to travel a similar distance.


The full roll is often played side-style in order to generate enough power in the stroke.
                        However, if the
                        player has good timing and technique, it is possible to play this stroke centre-style.

Pass Roll
The pass roll is similar to the full roll, but the striker's ball travels even further than the croqueted ball. In order to achieve this, even more forward spin is required - as a consequence, the hands need to drop even further down
                        the mallet
                        than for the full roll. The pass roll needs to be played with more punch than the full roll, meaning that the mallet head must still be in the process of accellerating at the moment it makes contact with the ball.  To help achieve this, you can shorten the backswing and apply additional force to the forward swing.  
                    



The mallet strikes blue at an acute angle,
                                creating
                                maximum topspin


Like the full roll, the pass roll is often played side-style in order to generate the power and "punch" required to apply such topspin.  Because of the steep downward angle of the mallet
                        required to generate the necessary forward spin means standing very far forward, playing this stroke
                        centre-style will
                        give a very restricted backswing.  The placement of the bottom hand should be very close to the mallet head, but beware that touching the mallet head during the stroke is a fault.

Split Shot
A split shot is not a croquet stroke in its own right, but rather a variation of the croquet
                        strokes listed above. It can apply to anything from a stop shot through to a pass roll, and
                        refers to playing a croquet stroke where both balls go in different directions.



Line of aim is halfway between the two
                                intended destination points


For a given croquet stroke, the player should line the two balls up in a line of where they wish
                        the object ball to be sent. After determining the intended destination point for the striker's ball, you must aim at a point halfway between the two. The croqueted ball will actually "pull" slightly in the direction which you are playing the stroke, so some allowance needs to be made for that when lining up the two balls.
The wider the angle of split, the less "roll" (topspin) is required to be applied to the striker's
                        ball to get it to travel a given distance - knowing the amount of roll to apply comes with practice.

Special Shots
There are various shots that crop up during a game which are needed to recover from particular situations, such as when you have run a hoop but have a hampered backswing - and deserve special mention.  

Jump Shot
The jump stroke is a single-ball stroke in which you hit downwards onto your ball, causing it to
                        jump into
                        the air. There are a number of reasons for doing this, such as jumping over a ball lodged in
                        your hoop after
                        a failed peel, or jumping over a hoop to try and hit another ball. Perhaps the most common
                        scenario for
                        playing a jump stroke is to try and run a very angled hoop (e.g. from over 40deg) - hitting down
                        onto your ball imparts extra forward spin, and
                        this can be useful to coax a ball through what would otherwise be considered an unrunnable hoop.
                    



By striking down on the the blue, it is rebounded into
                                the air with a lot of topspin


There are a number of ways to play the jump stroke, depending on how high, and how sharply, you
                        need your
                        ball to rise off the ground. In general, the more sharply you hit down onto your ball, the
                        steeper the jump
                        angle. If you played the stroke with a fairly shallow downward angle, then the ball would rise
                        more
                        gradually over a longer distance compared to playing the stroke with sharper and more pronounced
                        downward angle. 
When using a jump shot to run a hoop, the most important thing is to miss the near wire of the
                        hoop. The additional topspin imparted by the jump shot will deter the ball from rebounding when
                        it makes contact with the hoop upright, and instead will keep spinning forwards and (hopefully)
                        through the hoop.

Sweep Shot
A sweep shot is used to get out of a hampered situation, normally after running a hoop and not having a clean swing at the reception ball.  It is played while kneeling on the court with the mallet held horizontally across the body, one hand near (but not touching) the mallet head and the other hand closer to the top of the handle.



Sweep shot after blue has run the hoop, hampered from red


The swing is in an arc shape, and is played in such a way that the hand closest to the mallet head will be moving forwards when the top hand is moving backwards, in a lever motion.  As a result, when the mallet face contacts the ball, it hits across the ball horizontally, imparting a small amount of side spin.  This in turn will help the ball curve slightly in the direction towards the intended target.  The line of aim should be at the outside edge of the target ball.
It is a shot worth practising both left-handed and right-handed, because either method may be required during a game, depending on the side of the hoop the mallet needs to swing.
There are a number of faults to look out for when playing a sweep shot, and some common ones include
                    
Touching the mallet head
Resting your arm on your leg
Resting a hand or arm on the ground
Hitting the ball with the corner of the mallet face


Back to top




Cannon
A cannon is a shot involving 3 (or occasionally 4) balls.  The most common cannon is the Corner 1 cannon, where three balls will all be in the corner, each ball in contact with one other ball.  
A common scenario where a cannon might arise is when the striker rushes a ball into the corner area when there is already a ball on the corner spot.  The roqueted ball is lined back onto the court, in contact with the existing corner ball, on either boundary.  At that point the existing corner ball can be moved to any position around the roqueted ball in contact with it.  As the striker made a roquet, they must take croquet from the roqueted ball.  The striker's ball must not be in contact with the existing corner ball.
If the striker's ball is for hoop 1, then the aim of the Corner 1 cannon would be to croquet a pioneer ball towards hoop 2, and in the same shot roquet the third ball, rushing it to hoop 1.  This may sound somewhat complicated, but once you break it down it is actually fairly simple.





Blue rushes black into the corner square.  Red is a corner ball.  Black is replaced on the yardline in contact with red.

Exact line of aim will need to be adjusted for the player's mallet characteristics - generally a heavier mallet which is better at rolls would aim somewhere near hoop 6 whereas a light mallet that is good for stop shots would aim nearer to hoop 5.  For most players, it would be somewhere between the two.  The stroke is normally played as a drive, but again could be slightly adjusted depending upon mallet characteristics.

Shots
To borrow from John Prince's croquet video, "A famous player once remarked that hitting one's own
                        ball
                        correctly was the only difficult thing in croquet". 
Below you will find an overview of the shots involved in croquet, and some high-level guidance on how
                    to achieve them. More detailed information on specific strokes may also be found in the Technique section
If you have read the introduction section, or are already somewhat familiar with croquet, then you
                    will
                    realise that there are two basic types of stroke involved - single ball strokes and croquet
                    strokes.

Single-ball strokes

Roquet
A roquet is the act of hitting your ball onto another ball.  A roquet can be made at any distance, be it the length of the court, or from just a few inches.  Most of what is written in the Technique section covers how to play with a technique that you would use to make a roquet.
To reiterate, it is important to develop a smooth, unhurried swing.  The best way to do this is to stand far enough back from the ball so that your swing is free and you can clearly see the aiming line.  Finding the aiming line is easier if you are able to see your own ball and also the target ball in your peripheral vision, and therefore when you have taken your stance, your head should not be any further forward than the back of the striker's ball.  Once the aiming has been completed, the only thought should then be on striking your own ball with the centre of the mallet, and keeping your head down throughout the strike.



A roquet should be hit with a smooth strike and the mallet should be flat upon impact with the ball


Remember to ensure that whatever technique you use, it should be the same for roquets of any distance.  A good practice routine for roqueting is to take two sets of balls, and place each set 4-5 yards apart.  Take 4 shots.  If you hit them all, then extend the range to 5 yards and repeat.  Keep extending the range by a yard each time.

Rush
Not exactly what the name implies, there is nothing hurried about a rush! A rush is simply a
                        roquet but from
                        short range - indeed, sometimes a rush is referred to as a "roquet-rush". What sets a rush apart
                        from a
                        normal roquet is that instead of just trying to hit the target ball (as with a roquet), the aim
                        of the rush
                        is to send the target ball to a specific spot or area so that the next shot (a croquet stroke) is
                        played from
                        as easy a place as possible. 



A short rush. Notice that the mallet is parallel to the
                                    ground at
                                    point of contact


An example of this might be when your ball is 1-foot away from
                        another ball and
                        you would attempt to roquet the ball so that it stops near to your current hoop - from there you
                        could play
                        your croquet stroke from a position that is already close to your hoop!
A rush that is not in a straight line is referred to as a "cut rush", whereby you aim at a point on the object ball that is off-centre.  In exactly the same concept as in snooker or pool, when the centre of your ball hits the spot on the object ball, the object ball will travel in a direction in line with that spot.

The key to being a good croquet player is to avoid having to play difficult shots very often.
                        Mastering the
                        rush is a key part of achieving this goal.

Hoop Shot
When running a hoop, the same principle applies as with making a roquet. It is particularly
                        important here to
                        observe a smooth follow-through, because this will enable the ball to be imparted with natural
                        forward-spin
                        so that the ball is rolling - not skidding - when it reaches the hoop. Any minor misjudgement of
                        direction
                        of the shot may be alleviated by the forward spin that has been imparted. Conversely it you were
                        to jab at
                        the ball with a quick stabbing motion, it would negate any natural forward spin and cause the
                        ball to skid
                        along the ground - this can result in the ball stopping and sticking in the hoop upon contact
                        with the
                        hoop upright.
When running hoops from an angle, the key thing to remember is that the ball must miss the "near wire"
                        (the hoop upright closest to the ball) in order to run the hoop. Even a light brush against the
                        near wire will result in a failed hoop



Running an angled hoop.  The shot on the left will fail because the centre of the ball is aimed at the centre of the gap.  The shot on the right will succeed because the edge of the ball is aimed to just miss the near upright of the hoop.


While it is true that topspin can help a ball run a hoop, you must avoid the temptation to apply additional topspin via hitting down on the ball - doing so is likely to lead to inaccuracy with direction and also loss of control, and should
                        be reserved for only extreme angles where running the hoop would otherwise be very doubtful.

Croquet strokes

Takeoff
While the takeoff is technically a croquet stroke, in reality it is played in the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke. The main purpose of the takeoff is to position the striker's ball for its continuation
                        stroke, and
                        leave the croqueted ball more-or-less where it is. When playing the takeoff, you must remember
                        that the
                        croqueted ball has to move, otherwise it will not be a valid croquet stroke and incur
                        end-of-turn.

Blue plays a "thick" takeoff from red
                                



You can play a takeoff from either side of the croqueted ball. The amount by which the croqueted
                        ball moves
                        is determined by the angle towards the object ball at which you hit - a small inward angle will
                        result in what is
                        called a "fine" or "thin" takeoff, whereby the croqueted ball just moves maybe an inch or two.
                        If you hit in towards
                        the croqueted ball more, then more momentum will be transferred into it, moving it more -
                        resulting in
                        what's known as a "thick takeoff".
Note also that some natural side-spin will be imparted on the striker's ball due to having been
                        in contact
                        with the croqueted ball. After the striker's ball is struck, and as it slows down, it will curve
                        inwards
                        slightly, in the same direction that which the croqueted ball had been on.
Back to top




Stop Shot
The stop shot is a croquet stroke which causes the striker's ball to move the shortest
                        distance in
                        relation to the croqueted ball. This is achieved by hitting slightly underneath the
                        centreline of
                        your ball, countering the natural forward spin which would be imparted when playing a normal
                        stroke. The
                        mallet is grounded upon impacting the ball and there is no follow-through. Because the mallet head is angled upward (as shown in the image), the mallet handle is angled slightly further back than normal, so in order to play the stop shot comfortably, you should stand with your feet slightly further back than you would for a normal stroke.
                       





Note the upward angle of the mallet face

Depending on the lawn, balls and mallet weight, ratios of anywhere between 1:5 and 1:10 (and
                        sometimes even
                        higher) can be achieved with a stop shot. It is a good idea to practise and become very familiar
                        with your
                        stop shot ratio, as the easiest way to play a well-controlled break is through the use of
                        accurate stop
                        shots and drives.
Although playing a stop shot is easy, a good technique is required to achieve a good ratio. Essentially the only shot where a smooth strike is unhelpful, it can take a while to master the timing involved in grounding the mallet at the exact moment of impact with the ball.
As mentioned above, you should stand further back from the ball when playing a stop shot because the whole mallet is angled slightly back.  Placement of the feet on this shot varies - some player will take a half-step back with both
                        feet, whereas others will keep one foot in the normal position with the other further behind,
                        rocking onto the back foot to achieve the same result.
Back to top




Drive
The drive is the simplest croquet stroke to play, as it is played exactly the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke - with a normal stance and a normal follow through. Although the ratio will always vary
                        depending on
                        a number of factors (lawn, ball composition and mallet weight), the standard ratio achieved with
                        a drive is
                        about 1:3.



The drive is played like a single-ball stroke
                            


As with the stop shot, it is important to develop a consistent and repeatable drive ratio,
                        because these two
                        strokes are the basis of solid and controlled break play.
                    
Back to top




Half Roll
The half roll is played by hitting slightly downwards onto your ball - this imparts a small
                        amount of extra
                        forward spin compared to a drive, enabling a ratio of about 1:2. In order to play the stroke
                        comfortably,
                        you should stand further forward than for a normal stroke, with your feet (or at least your
                        front foot)
                        about level with the striker's ball. Because you are standing closer to the ball than normal on this shot, moving both your hands down the mallet somewhat will make the shot easier to play, as it will give more control over the mallet and also make the backswing easier.  



The mallet strikes blue at a downward angle
                                to impart
                                additional topspin, increasing the distance blue travels


The half roll can easily be played centre-style, however some players choose to play this stroke
                        side-style
                        in order to generate more power. 
Back to top




Full Roll
The full roll is a croquet stroke where both balls travel approximately the same distance. It is
                        often used
                        as a recovery stroke. In order to get the
                        striker's ball
                        to travel the same distance as the croqueted ball, a lot of forward spin is needed to be
                        imparted on the
                        striker's ball - to achieve this, your hands need to drop a lot further down the mallet than
                        normal, and
                        the mallet should impact the striker's ball at a steeper angle than for a half roll.



The mallet strikes blue at a steep angle,
                                imparting high
                                topspin and causing both balls to travel a similar distance.


The full roll is often played side-style in order to generate enough power in the stroke.
                        However, if the
                        player has good timing and technique, it is possible to play this stroke centre-style.

Pass Roll
The pass roll is similar to the full roll, but the striker's ball travels even further than the croqueted ball. In order to achieve this, even more forward spin is required - as a consequence, the hands need to drop even further down
                        the mallet
                        than for the full roll. The pass roll needs to be played with more punch than the full roll, meaning that the mallet head must still be in the process of accellerating at the moment it makes contact with the ball.  To help achieve this, you can shorten the backswing and apply additional force to the forward swing.  
                    



The mallet strikes blue at an acute angle,
                                creating
                                maximum topspin


Like the full roll, the pass roll is often played side-style in order to generate the power and "punch" required to apply such topspin.  Because of the steep downward angle of the mallet
                        required to generate the necessary forward spin means standing very far forward, playing this stroke
                        centre-style will
                        give a very restricted backswing.  The placement of the bottom hand should be very close to the mallet head, but beware that touching the mallet head during the stroke is a fault.

Split Shot
A split shot is not a croquet stroke in its own right, but rather a variation of the croquet
                        strokes listed above. It can apply to anything from a stop shot through to a pass roll, and
                        refers to playing a croquet stroke where both balls go in different directions.



Line of aim is halfway between the two
                                intended destination points


For a given croquet stroke, the player should line the two balls up in a line of where they wish
                        the object ball to be sent. After determining the intended destination point for the striker's ball, you must aim at a point halfway between the two. The croqueted ball will actually "pull" slightly in the direction which you are playing the stroke, so some allowance needs to be made for that when lining up the two balls.
The wider the angle of split, the less "roll" (topspin) is required to be applied to the striker's
                        ball to get it to travel a given distance - knowing the amount of roll to apply comes with practice.

Special Shots
There are various shots that crop up during a game which are needed to recover from particular situations, such as when you have run a hoop but have a hampered backswing - and deserve special mention.  

Jump Shot
The jump stroke is a single-ball stroke in which you hit downwards onto your ball, causing it to
                        jump into
                        the air. There are a number of reasons for doing this, such as jumping over a ball lodged in
                        your hoop after
                        a failed peel, or jumping over a hoop to try and hit another ball. Perhaps the most common
                        scenario for
                        playing a jump stroke is to try and run a very angled hoop (e.g. from over 40deg) - hitting down
                        onto your ball imparts extra forward spin, and
                        this can be useful to coax a ball through what would otherwise be considered an unrunnable hoop.
                    



By striking down on the the blue, it is rebounded into
                                the air with a lot of topspin


There are a number of ways to play the jump stroke, depending on how high, and how sharply, you
                        need your
                        ball to rise off the ground. In general, the more sharply you hit down onto your ball, the
                        steeper the jump
                        angle. If you played the stroke with a fairly shallow downward angle, then the ball would rise
                        more
                        gradually over a longer distance compared to playing the stroke with sharper and more pronounced
                        downward angle. 
When using a jump shot to run a hoop, the most important thing is to miss the near wire of the
                        hoop. The additional topspin imparted by the jump shot will deter the ball from rebounding when
                        it makes contact with the hoop upright, and instead will keep spinning forwards and (hopefully)
                        through the hoop.

Sweep Shot
A sweep shot is used to get out of a hampered situation, normally after running a hoop and not having a clean swing at the reception ball.  It is played while kneeling on the court with the mallet held horizontally across the body, one hand near (but not touching) the mallet head and the other hand closer to the top of the handle.



Sweep shot after blue has run the hoop, hampered from red


The swing is in an arc shape, and is played in such a way that the hand closest to the mallet head will be moving forwards when the top hand is moving backwards, in a lever motion.  As a result, when the mallet face contacts the ball, it hits across the ball horizontally, imparting a small amount of side spin.  This in turn will help the ball curve slightly in the direction towards the intended target.  The line of aim should be at the outside edge of the target ball.
It is a shot worth practising both left-handed and right-handed, because either method may be required during a game, depending on the side of the hoop the mallet needs to swing.
There are a number of faults to look out for when playing a sweep shot, and some common ones include
                    
Touching the mallet head
Resting your arm on your leg
Resting a hand or arm on the ground
Hitting the ball with the corner of the mallet face

Cannon
A cannon is a shot involving 3 (or occasionally 4) balls.  The most common cannon is the Corner 1 cannon, where three balls will all be in the corner, each ball in contact with one other ball.  
A common scenario where a cannon might arise is when the striker rushes a ball into the corner area when there is already a ball on the corner spot.  The roqueted ball is lined back onto the court, in contact with the existing corner ball, on either boundary.  At that point the existing corner ball can be moved to any position around the roqueted ball in contact with it.  As the striker made a roquet, they must take croquet from the roqueted ball.  The striker's ball must not be in contact with the existing corner ball.
If the striker's ball is for hoop 1, then the aim of the Corner 1 cannon would be to croquet a pioneer ball towards hoop 2, and in the same shot roquet the third ball, rushing it to hoop 1.  This may sound somewhat complicated, but once you break it down it is actually fairly simple.





Blue rushes black into the corner square.  Red is a corner ball.  Black is replaced on the yardline in contact with red.

Exact line of aim will need to be adjusted for the player's mallet characteristics - generally a heavier mallet which is better at rolls would aim somewhere near hoop 6 whereas a light mallet that is good for stop shots would aim nearer to hoop 5.  For most players, it would be somewhere between the two.  The stroke is normally played as a drive, but again could be slightly adjusted depending upon mallet characteristics.

Shots
To borrow from John Prince's croquet video, "A famous player once remarked that hitting one's own
                        ball
                        correctly was the only difficult thing in croquet". 
Below you will find an overview of the shots involved in croquet, and some high-level guidance on how
                    to achieve them. More detailed information on specific strokes may also be found in the Technique section
If you have read the introduction section, or are already somewhat familiar with croquet, then you
                    will
                    realise that there are two basic types of stroke involved - single ball strokes and croquet
                    strokes.

Single-ball strokes

Roquet
A roquet is the act of hitting your ball onto another ball.  A roquet can be made at any distance, be it the length of the court, or from just a few inches.  Most of what is written in the Technique section covers how to play with a technique that you would use to make a roquet.
To reiterate, it is important to develop a smooth, unhurried swing.  The best way to do this is to stand far enough back from the ball so that your swing is free and you can clearly see the aiming line.  Finding the aiming line is easier if you are able to see your own ball and also the target ball in your peripheral vision, and therefore when you have taken your stance, your head should not be any further forward than the back of the striker's ball.  Once the aiming has been completed, the only thought should then be on striking your own ball with the centre of the mallet, and keeping your head down throughout the strike.



A roquet should be hit with a smooth strike and the mallet should be flat upon impact with the ball


Remember to ensure that whatever technique you use, it should be the same for roquets of any distance.  A good practice routine for roqueting is to take two sets of balls, and place each set 4-5 yards apart.  Take 4 shots.  If you hit them all, then extend the range to 5 yards and repeat.  Keep extending the range by a yard each time.

Rush
Not exactly what the name implies, there is nothing hurried about a rush! A rush is simply a
                        roquet but from
                        short range - indeed, sometimes a rush is referred to as a "roquet-rush". What sets a rush apart
                        from a
                        normal roquet is that instead of just trying to hit the target ball (as with a roquet), the aim
                        of the rush
                        is to send the target ball to a specific spot or area so that the next shot (a croquet stroke) is
                        played from
                        as easy a place as possible. 



A short rush. Notice that the mallet is parallel to the
                                    ground at
                                    point of contact


An example of this might be when your ball is 1-foot away from
                        another ball and
                        you would attempt to roquet the ball so that it stops near to your current hoop - from there you
                        could play
                        your croquet stroke from a position that is already close to your hoop!
A rush that is not in a straight line is referred to as a "cut rush", whereby you aim at a point on the object ball that is off-centre.  In exactly the same concept as in snooker or pool, when the centre of your ball hits the spot on the object ball, the object ball will travel in a direction in line with that spot.

The key to being a good croquet player is to avoid having to play difficult shots very often.
                        Mastering the
                        rush is a key part of achieving this goal.

Hoop Shot
When running a hoop, the same principle applies as with making a roquet. It is particularly
                        important here to
                        observe a smooth follow-through, because this will enable the ball to be imparted with natural
                        forward-spin
                        so that the ball is rolling - not skidding - when it reaches the hoop. Any minor misjudgement of
                        direction
                        of the shot may be alleviated by the forward spin that has been imparted. Conversely it you were
                        to jab at
                        the ball with a quick stabbing motion, it would negate any natural forward spin and cause the
                        ball to skid
                        along the ground - this can result in the ball stopping and sticking in the hoop upon contact
                        with the
                        hoop upright.
When running hoops from an angle, the key thing to remember is that the ball must miss the "near wire"
                        (the hoop upright closest to the ball) in order to run the hoop. Even a light brush against the
                        near wire will result in a failed hoop



Running an angled hoop.  The shot on the left will fail because the centre of the ball is aimed at the centre of the gap.  The shot on the right will succeed because the edge of the ball is aimed to just miss the near upright of the hoop.


While it is true that topspin can help a ball run a hoop, you must avoid the temptation to apply additional topspin via hitting down on the ball - doing so is likely to lead to inaccuracy with direction and also loss of control, and should
                        be reserved for only extreme angles where running the hoop would otherwise be very doubtful.

Croquet strokes

Takeoff
While the takeoff is technically a croquet stroke, in reality it is played in the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke. The main purpose of the takeoff is to position the striker's ball for its continuation
                        stroke, and
                        leave the croqueted ball more-or-less where it is. When playing the takeoff, you must remember
                        that the
                        croqueted ball has to move, otherwise it will not be a valid croquet stroke and incur
                        end-of-turn.

Blue plays a "thick" takeoff from red
                                



You can play a takeoff from either side of the croqueted ball. The amount by which the croqueted
                        ball moves
                        is determined by the angle towards the object ball at which you hit - a small inward angle will
                        result in what is
                        called a "fine" or "thin" takeoff, whereby the croqueted ball just moves maybe an inch or two.
                        If you hit in towards
                        the croqueted ball more, then more momentum will be transferred into it, moving it more -
                        resulting in
                        what's known as a "thick takeoff".
Note also that some natural side-spin will be imparted on the striker's ball due to having been
                        in contact
                        with the croqueted ball. After the striker's ball is struck, and as it slows down, it will curve
                        inwards
                        slightly, in the same direction that which the croqueted ball had been on.
Back to top




Stop Shot
The stop shot is a croquet stroke which causes the striker's ball to move the shortest
                        distance in
                        relation to the croqueted ball. This is achieved by hitting slightly underneath the
                        centreline of
                        your ball, countering the natural forward spin which would be imparted when playing a normal
                        stroke. The
                        mallet is grounded upon impacting the ball and there is no follow-through. Because the mallet head is angled upward (as shown in the image), the mallet handle is angled slightly further back than normal, so in order to play the stop shot comfortably, you should stand with your feet slightly further back than you would for a normal stroke.
                       





Note the upward angle of the mallet face

Depending on the lawn, balls and mallet weight, ratios of anywhere between 1:5 and 1:10 (and
                        sometimes even
                        higher) can be achieved with a stop shot. It is a good idea to practise and become very familiar
                        with your
                        stop shot ratio, as the easiest way to play a well-controlled break is through the use of
                        accurate stop
                        shots and drives.
Although playing a stop shot is easy, a good technique is required to achieve a good ratio. Essentially the only shot where a smooth strike is unhelpful, it can take a while to master the timing involved in grounding the mallet at the exact moment of impact with the ball.
As mentioned above, you should stand further back from the ball when playing a stop shot because the whole mallet is angled slightly back.  Placement of the feet on this shot varies - some player will take a half-step back with both
                        feet, whereas others will keep one foot in the normal position with the other further behind,
                        rocking onto the back foot to achieve the same result.
Back to top




Drive
The drive is the simplest croquet stroke to play, as it is played exactly the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke - with a normal stance and a normal follow through. Although the ratio will always vary
                        depending on
                        a number of factors (lawn, ball composition and mallet weight), the standard ratio achieved with
                        a drive is
                        about 1:3.



The drive is played like a single-ball stroke
                            


As with the stop shot, it is important to develop a consistent and repeatable drive ratio,
                        because these two
                        strokes are the basis of solid and controlled break play.
                    
Back to top




Half Roll
The half roll is played by hitting slightly downwards onto your ball - this imparts a small
                        amount of extra
                        forward spin compared to a drive, enabling a ratio of about 1:2. In order to play the stroke
                        comfortably,
                        you should stand further forward than for a normal stroke, with your feet (or at least your
                        front foot)
                        about level with the striker's ball. Because you are standing closer to the ball than normal on this shot, moving both your hands down the mallet somewhat will make the shot easier to play, as it will give more control over the mallet and also make the backswing easier.  



The mallet strikes blue at a downward angle
                                to impart
                                additional topspin, increasing the distance blue travels


The half roll can easily be played centre-style, however some players choose to play this stroke
                        side-style
                        in order to generate more power. 
Back to top




Full Roll
The full roll is a croquet stroke where both balls travel approximately the same distance. It is
                        often used
                        as a recovery stroke. In order to get the
                        striker's ball
                        to travel the same distance as the croqueted ball, a lot of forward spin is needed to be
                        imparted on the
                        striker's ball - to achieve this, your hands need to drop a lot further down the mallet than
                        normal, and
                        the mallet should impact the striker's ball at a steeper angle than for a half roll.



The mallet strikes blue at a steep angle,
                                imparting high
                                topspin and causing both balls to travel a similar distance.


The full roll is often played side-style in order to generate enough power in the stroke.
                        However, if the
                        player has good timing and technique, it is possible to play this stroke centre-style. 
Back to top




Pass Roll
The pass roll is similar to the full roll, but the striker's ball travels even further than the croqueted ball. In order to achieve this, even more forward spin is required - as a consequence, the hands need to drop even further down
                        the mallet
                        than for the full roll. The pass roll needs to be played with more punch than the full roll, meaning that the mallet head must still be in the process of accellerating at the moment it makes contact with the ball.  To help achieve this, you can shorten the backswing and apply additional force to the forward swing.  
                    



The mallet strikes blue at an acute angle,
                                creating
                                maximum topspin


Like the full roll, the pass roll is often played side-style in order to generate the power and "punch" required to apply such topspin.  Because of the steep downward angle of the mallet
                        required to generate the necessary forward spin means standing very far forward, playing this stroke
                        centre-style will
                        give a very restricted backswing.  The placement of the bottom hand should be very close to the mallet head, but beware that touching the mallet head during the stroke is a fault.

Split Shot
A split shot is not a croquet stroke in its own right, but rather a variation of the croquet
                        strokes listed above. It can apply to anything from a stop shot through to a pass roll, and
                        refers to playing a croquet stroke where both balls go in different directions.



Line of aim is halfway between the two
                                intended destination points


For a given croquet stroke, the player should line the two balls up in a line of where they wish
                        the object ball to be sent. After determining the intended destination point for the striker's ball, you must aim at a point halfway between the two. The croqueted ball will actually "pull" slightly in the direction which you are playing the stroke, so some allowance needs to be made for that when lining up the two balls.
The wider the angle of split, the less "roll" (topspin) is required to be applied to the striker's
                        ball to get it to travel a given distance - knowing the amount of roll to apply comes with practice.

Special Shots
There are various shots that crop up during a game which are needed to recover from particular situations, such as when you have run a hoop but have a hampered backswing - and deserve special mention.  

Jump Shot
The jump stroke is a single-ball stroke in which you hit downwards onto your ball, causing it to
                        jump into
                        the air. There are a number of reasons for doing this, such as jumping over a ball lodged in
                        your hoop after
                        a failed peel, or jumping over a hoop to try and hit another ball. Perhaps the most common
                        scenario for
                        playing a jump stroke is to try and run a very angled hoop (e.g. from over 40deg) - hitting down
                        onto your ball imparts extra forward spin, and
                        this can be useful to coax a ball through what would otherwise be considered an unrunnable hoop.
                    



By striking down on the the blue, it is rebounded into
                                the air with a lot of topspin


There are a number of ways to play the jump stroke, depending on how high, and how sharply, you
                        need your
                        ball to rise off the ground. In general, the more sharply you hit down onto your ball, the
                        steeper the jump
                        angle. If you played the stroke with a fairly shallow downward angle, then the ball would rise
                        more
                        gradually over a longer distance compared to playing the stroke with sharper and more pronounced
                        downward angle. 
When using a jump shot to run a hoop, the most important thing is to miss the near wire of the
                        hoop. The additional topspin imparted by the jump shot will deter the ball from rebounding when
                        it makes contact with the hoop upright, and instead will keep spinning forwards and (hopefully)
                        through the hoop.

Sweep Shot
A sweep shot is used to get out of a hampered situation, normally after running a hoop and not having a clean swing at the reception ball.  It is played while kneeling on the court with the mallet held horizontally across the body, one hand near (but not touching) the mallet head and the other hand closer to the top of the handle.



Sweep shot after blue has run the hoop, hampered from red


The swing is in an arc shape, and is played in such a way that the hand closest to the mallet head will be moving forwards when the top hand is moving backwards, in a lever motion.  As a result, when the mallet face contacts the ball, it hits across the ball horizontally, imparting a small amount of side spin.  This in turn will help the ball curve slightly in the direction towards the intended target.  The line of aim should be at the outside edge of the target ball.
It is a shot worth practising both left-handed and right-handed, because either method may be required during a game, depending on the side of the hoop the mallet needs to swing.
There are a number of faults to look out for when playing a sweep shot, and some common ones include
                    
Touching the mallet head
Resting your arm on your leg
Resting a hand or arm on the ground
Hitting the ball with the corner of the mallet face

Cannon
A cannon is a shot involving 3 (or occasionally 4) balls.  The most common cannon is the Corner 1 cannon, where three balls will all be in the corner, each ball in contact with one other ball.  
A common scenario where a cannon might arise is when the striker rushes a ball into the corner area when there is already a ball on the corner spot.  The roqueted ball is lined back onto the court, in contact with the existing corner ball, on either boundary.  At that point the existing corner ball can be moved to any position around the roqueted ball in contact with it.  As the striker made a roquet, they must take croquet from the roqueted ball.  The striker's ball must not be in contact with the existing corner ball.
If the striker's ball is for hoop 1, then the aim of the Corner 1 cannon would be to croquet a pioneer ball towards hoop 2, and in the same shot roquet the third ball, rushing it to hoop 1.  This may sound somewhat complicated, but once you break it down it is actually fairly simple.





Blue rushes black into the corner square.  Red is a corner ball.  Black is replaced on the yardline in contact with red.

Exact line of aim will need to be adjusted for the player's mallet characteristics - generally a heavier mallet which is better at rolls would aim somewhere near hoop 6 whereas a light mallet that is good for stop shots would aim nearer to hoop 5.  For most players, it would be somewhere between the two.  The stroke is normally played as a drive, but again could be slightly adjusted depending upon mallet characteristics.

Shots
To borrow from John Prince's croquet video, "A famous player once remarked that hitting one's own
                        ball
                        correctly was the only difficult thing in croquet". 
Below you will find an overview of the shots involved in croquet, and some high-level guidance on how
                    to achieve them. More detailed information on specific strokes may also be found in the Technique section
If you have read the introduction section, or are already somewhat familiar with croquet, then you
                    will
                    realise that there are two basic types of stroke involved - single ball strokes and croquet
                    strokes.

Single-ball strokes

Roquet
A roquet is the act of hitting your ball onto another ball.  A roquet can be made at any distance, be it the length of the court, or from just a few inches.  Most of what is written in the Technique section covers how to play with a technique that you would use to make a roquet.
To reiterate, it is important to develop a smooth, unhurried swing.  The best way to do this is to stand far enough back from the ball so that your swing is free and you can clearly see the aiming line.  Finding the aiming line is easier if you are able to see your own ball and also the target ball in your peripheral vision, and therefore when you have taken your stance, your head should not be any further forward than the back of the striker's ball.  Once the aiming has been completed, the only thought should then be on striking your own ball with the centre of the mallet, and keeping your head down throughout the strike.



A roquet should be hit with a smooth strike and the mallet should be flat upon impact with the ball


Remember to ensure that whatever technique you use, it should be the same for roquets of any distance.  A good practice routine for roqueting is to take two sets of balls, and place each set 4-5 yards apart.  Take 4 shots.  If you hit them all, then extend the range to 5 yards and repeat.  Keep extending the range by a yard each time.

Rush
Not exactly what the name implies, there is nothing hurried about a rush! A rush is simply a
                        roquet but from
                        short range - indeed, sometimes a rush is referred to as a "roquet-rush". What sets a rush apart
                        from a
                        normal roquet is that instead of just trying to hit the target ball (as with a roquet), the aim
                        of the rush
                        is to send the target ball to a specific spot or area so that the next shot (a croquet stroke) is
                        played from
                        as easy a place as possible. 



A short rush. Notice that the mallet is parallel to the
                                    ground at
                                    point of contact


An example of this might be when your ball is 1-foot away from
                        another ball and
                        you would attempt to roquet the ball so that it stops near to your current hoop - from there you
                        could play
                        your croquet stroke from a position that is already close to your hoop!
A rush that is not in a straight line is referred to as a "cut rush", whereby you aim at a point on the object ball that is off-centre.  In exactly the same concept as in snooker or pool, when the centre of your ball hits the spot on the object ball, the object ball will travel in a direction in line with that spot.

The key to being a good croquet player is to avoid having to play difficult shots very often.
                        Mastering the
                        rush is a key part of achieving this goal.

Hoop Shot
When running a hoop, the same principle applies as with making a roquet. It is particularly
                        important here to
                        observe a smooth follow-through, because this will enable the ball to be imparted with natural
                        forward-spin
                        so that the ball is rolling - not skidding - when it reaches the hoop. Any minor misjudgement of
                        direction
                        of the shot may be alleviated by the forward spin that has been imparted. Conversely it you were
                        to jab at
                        the ball with a quick stabbing motion, it would negate any natural forward spin and cause the
                        ball to skid
                        along the ground - this can result in the ball stopping and sticking in the hoop upon contact
                        with the
                        hoop upright.
When running hoops from an angle, the key thing to remember is that the ball must miss the "near wire"
                        (the hoop upright closest to the ball) in order to run the hoop. Even a light brush against the
                        near wire will result in a failed hoop



Running an angled hoop.  The shot on the left will fail because the centre of the ball is aimed at the centre of the gap.  The shot on the right will succeed because the edge of the ball is aimed to just miss the near upright of the hoop.


While it is true that topspin can help a ball run a hoop, you must avoid the temptation to apply additional topspin via hitting down on the ball - doing so is likely to lead to inaccuracy with direction and also loss of control, and should
                        be reserved for only extreme angles where running the hoop would otherwise be very doubtful.

Croquet strokes

Takeoff
While the takeoff is technically a croquet stroke, in reality it is played in the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke. The main purpose of the takeoff is to position the striker's ball for its continuation
                        stroke, and
                        leave the croqueted ball more-or-less where it is. When playing the takeoff, you must remember
                        that the
                        croqueted ball has to move, otherwise it will not be a valid croquet stroke and incur
                        end-of-turn.

Blue plays a "thick" takeoff from red
                                



You can play a takeoff from either side of the croqueted ball. The amount by which the croqueted
                        ball moves
                        is determined by the angle towards the object ball at which you hit - a small inward angle will
                        result in what is
                        called a "fine" or "thin" takeoff, whereby the croqueted ball just moves maybe an inch or two.
                        If you hit in towards
                        the croqueted ball more, then more momentum will be transferred into it, moving it more -
                        resulting in
                        what's known as a "thick takeoff".
Note also that some natural side-spin will be imparted on the striker's ball due to having been
                        in contact
                        with the croqueted ball. After the striker's ball is struck, and as it slows down, it will curve
                        inwards
                        slightly, in the same direction that which the croqueted ball had been on.
Back to top




Stop Shot
The stop shot is a croquet stroke which causes the striker's ball to move the shortest
                        distance in
                        relation to the croqueted ball. This is achieved by hitting slightly underneath the
                        centreline of
                        your ball, countering the natural forward spin which would be imparted when playing a normal
                        stroke. The
                        mallet is grounded upon impacting the ball and there is no follow-through. Because the mallet head is angled upward (as shown in the image), the mallet handle is angled slightly further back than normal, so in order to play the stop shot comfortably, you should stand with your feet slightly further back than you would for a normal stroke.
                       





Note the upward angle of the mallet face

Depending on the lawn, balls and mallet weight, ratios of anywhere between 1:5 and 1:10 (and
                        sometimes even
                        higher) can be achieved with a stop shot. It is a good idea to practise and become very familiar
                        with your
                        stop shot ratio, as the easiest way to play a well-controlled break is through the use of
                        accurate stop
                        shots and drives.
Although playing a stop shot is easy, a good technique is required to achieve a good ratio. Essentially the only shot where a smooth strike is unhelpful, it can take a while to master the timing involved in grounding the mallet at the exact moment of impact with the ball.
As mentioned above, you should stand further back from the ball when playing a stop shot because the whole mallet is angled slightly back.  Placement of the feet on this shot varies - some player will take a half-step back with both
                        feet, whereas others will keep one foot in the normal position with the other further behind,
                        rocking onto the back foot to achieve the same result.
Back to top




Drive
The drive is the simplest croquet stroke to play, as it is played exactly the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke - with a normal stance and a normal follow through. Although the ratio will always vary
                        depending on
                        a number of factors (lawn, ball composition and mallet weight), the standard ratio achieved with
                        a drive is
                        about 1:3.



The drive is played like a single-ball stroke
                            


As with the stop shot, it is important to develop a consistent and repeatable drive ratio,
                        because these two
                        strokes are the basis of solid and controlled break play.
                    
Back to top




Half Roll
The half roll is played by hitting slightly downwards onto your ball - this imparts a small
                        amount of extra
                        forward spin compared to a drive, enabling a ratio of about 1:2. In order to play the stroke
                        comfortably,
                        you should stand further forward than for a normal stroke, with your feet (or at least your
                        front foot)
                        about level with the striker's ball. Because you are standing closer to the ball than normal on this shot, moving both your hands down the mallet somewhat will make the shot easier to play, as it will give more control over the mallet and also make the backswing easier.  



The mallet strikes blue at a downward angle
                                to impart
                                additional topspin, increasing the distance blue travels


The half roll can easily be played centre-style, however some players choose to play this stroke
                        side-style
                        in order to generate more power. 
Back to top




Full Roll
The full roll is a croquet stroke where both balls travel approximately the same distance. It is
                        often used
                        as a recovery stroke. In order to get the
                        striker's ball
                        to travel the same distance as the croqueted ball, a lot of forward spin is needed to be
                        imparted on the
                        striker's ball - to achieve this, your hands need to drop a lot further down the mallet than
                        normal, and
                        the mallet should impact the striker's ball at a steeper angle than for a half roll.



The mallet strikes blue at a steep angle,
                                imparting high
                                topspin and causing both balls to travel a similar distance.


The full roll is often played side-style in order to generate enough power in the stroke.
                        However, if the
                        player has good timing and technique, it is possible to play this stroke centre-style. 
Back to top




Pass Roll
The pass roll is similar to the full roll, but the striker's ball travels even further than the croqueted ball. In order to achieve this, even more forward spin is required - as a consequence, the hands need to drop even further down
                        the mallet
                        than for the full roll. The pass roll needs to be played with more punch than the full roll, meaning that the mallet head must still be in the process of accellerating at the moment it makes contact with the ball.  To help achieve this, you can shorten the backswing and apply additional force to the forward swing.  
                    



The mallet strikes blue at an acute angle,
                                creating
                                maximum topspin


Like the full roll, the pass roll is often played side-style in order to generate the power and "punch" required to apply such topspin.  Because of the steep downward angle of the mallet
                        required to generate the necessary forward spin means standing very far forward, playing this stroke
                        centre-style will
                        give a very restricted backswing.  The placement of the bottom hand should be very close to the mallet head, but beware that touching the mallet head during the stroke is a fault.
                    
Back to top




Split Shot
A split shot is not a croquet stroke in its own right, but rather a variation of the croquet
                        strokes listed above. It can apply to anything from a stop shot through to a pass roll, and
                        refers to playing a croquet stroke where both balls go in different directions.



Line of aim is halfway between the two
                                intended destination points


For a given croquet stroke, the player should line the two balls up in a line of where they wish
                        the object ball to be sent. After determining the intended destination point for the striker's ball, you must aim at a point halfway between the two. The croqueted ball will actually "pull" slightly in the direction which you are playing the stroke, so some allowance needs to be made for that when lining up the two balls.
The wider the angle of split, the less "roll" (topspin) is required to be applied to the striker's
                        ball to get it to travel a given distance - knowing the amount of roll to apply comes with practice.

Special Shots
There are various shots that crop up during a game which are needed to recover from particular situations, such as when you have run a hoop but have a hampered backswing - and deserve special mention.  

Jump Shot
The jump stroke is a single-ball stroke in which you hit downwards onto your ball, causing it to
                        jump into
                        the air. There are a number of reasons for doing this, such as jumping over a ball lodged in
                        your hoop after
                        a failed peel, or jumping over a hoop to try and hit another ball. Perhaps the most common
                        scenario for
                        playing a jump stroke is to try and run a very angled hoop (e.g. from over 40deg) - hitting down
                        onto your ball imparts extra forward spin, and
                        this can be useful to coax a ball through what would otherwise be considered an unrunnable hoop.
                    



By striking down on the the blue, it is rebounded into
                                the air with a lot of topspin


There are a number of ways to play the jump stroke, depending on how high, and how sharply, you
                        need your
                        ball to rise off the ground. In general, the more sharply you hit down onto your ball, the
                        steeper the jump
                        angle. If you played the stroke with a fairly shallow downward angle, then the ball would rise
                        more
                        gradually over a longer distance compared to playing the stroke with sharper and more pronounced
                        downward angle. 
When using a jump shot to run a hoop, the most important thing is to miss the near wire of the
                        hoop. The additional topspin imparted by the jump shot will deter the ball from rebounding when
                        it makes contact with the hoop upright, and instead will keep spinning forwards and (hopefully)
                        through the hoop.

Sweep Shot
A sweep shot is used to get out of a hampered situation, normally after running a hoop and not having a clean swing at the reception ball.  It is played while kneeling on the court with the mallet held horizontally across the body, one hand near (but not touching) the mallet head and the other hand closer to the top of the handle.

The swing is in an arc shape, and is played in such a way that the hand closest to the mallet head will be moving forwards when the top hand is moving backwards, in a lever motion.  As a result, when the mallet face contacts the ball, it hits across the ball horizontally, imparting a small amount of side spin.  This in turn will help the ball curve slightly in the direction towards the intended target.  The line of aim should be at the outside edge of the target ball.
It is a shot worth practising both left-handed and right-handed, because either method may be required during a game, depending on the side of the hoop the mallet needs to swing.
There are a number of faults to look out for when playing a sweep shot, and some common ones include
                    
Touching the mallet head
Resting your arm on your leg
Resting a hand or arm on the ground
Hitting the ball with the corner of the mallet face

Cannon
A cannon is a shot involving 3 (or occasionally 4) balls.  The most common cannon is the Corner 1 cannon, where three balls will all be in the corner, each ball in contact with one other ball.  
A common scenario where a cannon might arise is when the striker rushes a ball into the corner area when there is already a ball on the corner spot.  The roqueted ball is lined back onto the court, in contact with the existing corner ball, on either boundary.  At that point the existing corner ball can be moved to any position around the roqueted ball in contact with it.  As the striker made a roquet, they must take croquet from the roqueted ball.  The striker's ball must not be in contact with the existing corner ball.
If the striker's ball is for hoop 1, then the aim of the Corner 1 cannon would be to croquet a pioneer ball towards hoop 2, and in the same shot roquet the third ball, rushing it to hoop 1.  This may sound somewhat complicated, but once you break it down it is actually fairly simple.





Blue rushes black into the corner square.  Red is a corner ball.  Black is replaced on the yardline in contact with red.

Exact line of aim will need to be adjusted for the player's mallet characteristics - generally a heavier mallet which is better at rolls would aim somewhere near hoop 6 whereas a light mallet that is good for stop shots would aim nearer to hoop 5.  For most players, it would be somewhere between the two.  The stroke is normally played as a drive, but again could be slightly adjusted depending upon mallet characteristics.

Shots
To borrow from John Prince's croquet video, "A famous player once remarked that hitting one's own
                        ball
                        correctly was the only difficult thing in croquet". 
Below you will find an overview of the shots involved in croquet, and some high-level guidance on how
                    to achieve them. More detailed information on specific strokes may also be found in the Technique section
If you have read the introduction section, or are already somewhat familiar with croquet, then you
                    will
                    realise that there are two basic types of stroke involved - single ball strokes and croquet
                    strokes.

Single-ball strokes

Roquet
A roquet is the act of hitting your ball onto another ball.  A roquet can be made at any distance, be it the length of the court, or from just a few inches.  Most of what is written in the Technique section covers how to play with a technique that you would use to make a roquet.
To reiterate, it is important to develop a smooth, unhurried swing.  The best way to do this is to stand far enough back from the ball so that your swing is free and you can clearly see the aiming line.  Finding the aiming line is easier if you are able to see your own ball and also the target ball in your peripheral vision, and therefore when you have taken your stance, your head should not be any further forward than the back of the striker's ball.  Once the aiming has been completed, the only thought should then be on striking your own ball with the centre of the mallet, and keeping your head down throughout the strike.



A roquet should be hit with a smooth strike and the mallet should be flat upon impact with the ball


Remember to ensure that whatever technique you use, it should be the same for roquets of any distance.  A good practice routine for roqueting is to take two sets of balls, and place each set 4-5 yards apart.  Take 4 shots.  If you hit them all, then extend the range to 5 yards and repeat.  Keep extending the range by a yard each time.

Rush
Not exactly what the name implies, there is nothing hurried about a rush! A rush is simply a
                        roquet but from
                        short range - indeed, sometimes a rush is referred to as a "roquet-rush". What sets a rush apart
                        from a
                        normal roquet is that instead of just trying to hit the target ball (as with a roquet), the aim
                        of the rush
                        is to send the target ball to a specific spot or area so that the next shot (a croquet stroke) is
                        played from
                        as easy a place as possible. 



A short rush. Notice that the mallet is parallel to the
                                    ground at
                                    point of contact


An example of this might be when your ball is 1-foot away from
                        another ball and
                        you would attempt to roquet the ball so that it stops near to your current hoop - from there you
                        could play
                        your croquet stroke from a position that is already close to your hoop!
A rush that is not in a straight line is referred to as a "cut rush", whereby you aim at a point on the object ball that is off-centre.  In exactly the same concept as in snooker or pool, when the centre of your ball hits the spot on the object ball, the object ball will travel in a direction in line with that spot.

The key to being a good croquet player is to avoid having to play difficult shots very often.
                        Mastering the
                        rush is a key part of achieving this goal.

Hoop Shot
When running a hoop, the same principle applies as with making a roquet. It is particularly
                        important here to
                        observe a smooth follow-through, because this will enable the ball to be imparted with natural
                        forward-spin
                        so that the ball is rolling - not skidding - when it reaches the hoop. Any minor misjudgement of
                        direction
                        of the shot may be alleviated by the forward spin that has been imparted. Conversely it you were
                        to jab at
                        the ball with a quick stabbing motion, it would negate any natural forward spin and cause the
                        ball to skid
                        along the ground - this can result in the ball stopping and sticking in the hoop upon contact
                        with the
                        hoop upright.
When running hoops from an angle, the key thing to remember is that the ball must miss the "near wire"
                        (the hoop upright closest to the ball) in order to run the hoop. Even a light brush against the
                        near wire will result in a failed hoop



Running an angled hoop.  The shot on the left will fail because the centre of the ball is aimed at the centre of the gap.  The shot on the right will succeed because the edge of the ball is aimed to just miss the near upright of the hoop.


While it is true that topspin can help a ball run a hoop, you must avoid the temptation to apply additional topspin via hitting down on the ball - doing so is likely to lead to inaccuracy with direction and also loss of control, and should
                        be reserved for only extreme angles where running the hoop would otherwise be very doubtful.

Croquet strokes

Takeoff
While the takeoff is technically a croquet stroke, in reality it is played in the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke. The main purpose of the takeoff is to position the striker's ball for its continuation
                        stroke, and
                        leave the croqueted ball more-or-less where it is. When playing the takeoff, you must remember
                        that the
                        croqueted ball has to move, otherwise it will not be a valid croquet stroke and incur
                        end-of-turn.

Blue plays a "thick" takeoff from red
                                



You can play a takeoff from either side of the croqueted ball. The amount by which the croqueted
                        ball moves
                        is determined by the angle towards the object ball at which you hit - a small inward angle will
                        result in what is
                        called a "fine" or "thin" takeoff, whereby the croqueted ball just moves maybe an inch or two.
                        If you hit in towards
                        the croqueted ball more, then more momentum will be transferred into it, moving it more -
                        resulting in
                        what's known as a "thick takeoff".
Note also that some natural side-spin will be imparted on the striker's ball due to having been
                        in contact
                        with the croqueted ball. After the striker's ball is struck, and as it slows down, it will curve
                        inwards
                        slightly, in the same direction that which the croqueted ball had been on.

Stop Shot
The stop shot is a croquet stroke which causes the striker's ball to move the shortest
                        distance in
                        relation to the croqueted ball. This is achieved by hitting slightly underneath the
                        centreline of
                        your ball, countering the natural forward spin which would be imparted when playing a normal
                        stroke. The
                        mallet is grounded upon impacting the ball and there is no follow-through. Because the mallet head is angled upward (as shown in the image), the mallet handle is angled slightly further back than normal, so in order to play the stop shot comfortably, you should stand with your feet slightly further back than you would for a normal stroke.
                       





Note the upward angle of the mallet face

Depending on the lawn, balls and mallet weight, ratios of anywhere between 1:5 and 1:10 (and
                        sometimes even
                        higher) can be achieved with a stop shot. It is a good idea to practise and become very familiar
                        with your
                        stop shot ratio, as the easiest way to play a well-controlled break is through the use of
                        accurate stop
                        shots and drives.
Although playing a stop shot is easy, a good technique is required to achieve a good ratio. Essentially the only shot where a smooth strike is unhelpful, it can take a while to master the timing involved in grounding the mallet at the exact moment of impact with the ball.
As mentioned above, you should stand further back from the ball when playing a stop shot because the whole mallet is angled slightly back.  Placement of the feet on this shot varies - some player will take a half-step back with both
                        feet, whereas others will keep one foot in the normal position with the other further behind,
                        rocking onto the back foot to achieve the same result.
Back to top




Drive
The drive is the simplest croquet stroke to play, as it is played exactly the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke - with a normal stance and a normal follow through. Although the ratio will always vary
                        depending on
                        a number of factors (lawn, ball composition and mallet weight), the standard ratio achieved with
                        a drive is
                        about 1:3.



The drive is played like a single-ball stroke
                            


As with the stop shot, it is important to develop a consistent and repeatable drive ratio,
                        because these two
                        strokes are the basis of solid and controlled break play.
                    
Back to top




Half Roll
The half roll is played by hitting slightly downwards onto your ball - this imparts a small
                        amount of extra
                        forward spin compared to a drive, enabling a ratio of about 1:2. In order to play the stroke
                        comfortably,
                        you should stand further forward than for a normal stroke, with your feet (or at least your
                        front foot)
                        about level with the striker's ball. Because you are standing closer to the ball than normal on this shot, moving both your hands down the mallet somewhat will make the shot easier to play, as it will give more control over the mallet and also make the backswing easier.  



The mallet strikes blue at a downward angle
                                to impart
                                additional topspin, increasing the distance blue travels


The half roll can easily be played centre-style, however some players choose to play this stroke
                        side-style
                        in order to generate more power. 
Back to top




Full Roll
The full roll is a croquet stroke where both balls travel approximately the same distance. It is
                        often used
                        as a recovery stroke. In order to get the
                        striker's ball
                        to travel the same distance as the croqueted ball, a lot of forward spin is needed to be
                        imparted on the
                        striker's ball - to achieve this, your hands need to drop a lot further down the mallet than
                        normal, and
                        the mallet should impact the striker's ball at a steeper angle than for a half roll.



The mallet strikes blue at a steep angle,
                                imparting high
                                topspin and causing both balls to travel a similar distance.


The full roll is often played side-style in order to generate enough power in the stroke.
                        However, if the
                        player has good timing and technique, it is possible to play this stroke centre-style. 
Back to top




Pass Roll
The pass roll is similar to the full roll, but the striker's ball travels even further than the croqueted ball. In order to achieve this, even more forward spin is required - as a consequence, the hands need to drop even further down
                        the mallet
                        than for the full roll. The pass roll needs to be played with more punch than the full roll, meaning that the mallet head must still be in the process of accellerating at the moment it makes contact with the ball.  To help achieve this, you can shorten the backswing and apply additional force to the forward swing.  
                    



The mallet strikes blue at an acute angle,
                                creating
                                maximum topspin


Like the full roll, the pass roll is often played side-style in order to generate the power and "punch" required to apply such topspin.  Because of the steep downward angle of the mallet
                        required to generate the necessary forward spin means standing very far forward, playing this stroke
                        centre-style will
                        give a very restricted backswing.  The placement of the bottom hand should be very close to the mallet head, but beware that touching the mallet head during the stroke is a fault.

Split Shot
A split shot is not a croquet stroke in its own right, but rather a variation of the croquet
                        strokes listed above. It can apply to anything from a stop shot through to a pass roll, and
                        refers to playing a croquet stroke where both balls go in different directions.



Line of aim is halfway between the two
                                intended destination points


For a given croquet stroke, the player should line the two balls up in a line of where they wish
                        the object ball to be sent. After determining the intended destination point for the striker's ball, you must aim at a point halfway between the two. The croqueted ball will actually "pull" slightly in the direction which you are playing the stroke, so some allowance needs to be made for that when lining up the two balls.
The wider the angle of split, the less "roll" (topspin) is required to be applied to the striker's
                        ball to get it to travel a given distance - knowing the amount of roll to apply comes with practice.

Special Shots
There are various shots that crop up during a game which are needed to recover from particular situations, such as when you have run a hoop but have a hampered backswing - and deserve special mention.  

Jump Shot
The jump stroke is a single-ball stroke in which you hit downwards onto your ball, causing it to
                        jump into
                        the air. There are a number of reasons for doing this, such as jumping over a ball lodged in
                        your hoop after
                        a failed peel, or jumping over a hoop to try and hit another ball. Perhaps the most common
                        scenario for
                        playing a jump stroke is to try and run a very angled hoop (e.g. from over 40deg) - hitting down
                        onto your ball imparts extra forward spin, and
                        this can be useful to coax a ball through what would otherwise be considered an unrunnable hoop.
                    



By striking down on the the blue, it is rebounded into
                                the air with a lot of topspin


There are a number of ways to play the jump stroke, depending on how high, and how sharply, you
                        need your
                        ball to rise off the ground. In general, the more sharply you hit down onto your ball, the
                        steeper the jump
                        angle. If you played the stroke with a fairly shallow downward angle, then the ball would rise
                        more
                        gradually over a longer distance compared to playing the stroke with sharper and more pronounced
                        downward angle. 
When using a jump shot to run a hoop, the most important thing is to miss the near wire of the
                        hoop. The additional topspin imparted by the jump shot will deter the ball from rebounding when
                        it makes contact with the hoop upright, and instead will keep spinning forwards and (hopefully)
                        through the hoop.

Sweep Shot
A sweep shot is used to get out of a hampered situation, normally after running a hoop and not having a clean swing at the reception ball.  It is played while kneeling on the court with the mallet held horizontally across the body, one hand near (but not touching) the mallet head and the other hand closer to the top of the handle.

The swing is in an arc shape, and is played in such a way that the hand closest to the mallet head will be moving forwards when the top hand is moving backwards, in a lever motion.  As a result, when the mallet face contacts the ball, it hits across the ball horizontally, imparting a small amount of side spin.  This in turn will help the ball curve slightly in the direction towards the intended target.  The line of aim should be at the outside edge of the target ball.
It is a shot worth practising both left-handed and right-handed, because either method may be required during a game, depending on the side of the hoop the mallet needs to swing.
There are a number of faults to look out for when playing a sweep shot, and some common ones include
                    
Touching the mallet head
Resting your arm on your leg
Resting a hand or arm on the ground
Hitting the ball with the corner of the mallet face

Cannon
A cannon is a shot involving 3 (or occasionally 4) balls.  The most common cannon is the Corner 1 cannon, where three balls will all be in the corner, each ball in contact with one other ball.  
A common scenario where a cannon might arise is when the striker rushes a ball into the corner area when there is already a ball on the corner spot.  The roqueted ball is lined back onto the court, in contact with the existing corner ball, on either boundary.  At that point the existing corner ball can be moved to any position around the roqueted ball in contact with it.  As the striker made a roquet, they must take croquet from the roqueted ball.  The striker's ball must not be in contact with the existing corner ball.
If the striker's ball is for hoop 1, then the aim of the Corner 1 cannon would be to croquet a pioneer ball towards hoop 2, and in the same shot roquet the third ball, rushing it to hoop 1.  This may sound somewhat complicated, but once you break it down it is actually fairly simple.





Blue rushes black into the corner square.  Red is a corner ball.  Black is replaced on the yardline in contact with red.

Exact line of aim will need to be adjusted for the player's mallet characteristics - generally a heavier mallet which is better at rolls would aim somewhere near hoop 6 whereas a light mallet that is good for stop shots would aim nearer to hoop 5.  For most players, it would be somewhere between the two.  The stroke is normally played as a drive, but again could be slightly adjusted depending upon mallet characteristics.

Shots
To borrow from John Prince's croquet video, "A famous player once remarked that hitting one's own
                        ball
                        correctly was the only difficult thing in croquet". 
Below you will find an overview of the shots involved in croquet, and some high-level guidance on how
                    to achieve them. More detailed information on specific strokes may also be found in the Technique section
If you have read the introduction section, or are already somewhat familiar with croquet, then you
                    will
                    realise that there are two basic types of stroke involved - single ball strokes and croquet
                    strokes.

Single-ball strokes

Roquet
A roquet is the act of hitting your ball onto another ball.  A roquet can be made at any distance, be it the length of the court, or from just a few inches.  Most of what is written in the Technique section covers how to play with a technique that you would use to make a roquet.
To reiterate, it is important to develop a smooth, unhurried swing.  The best way to do this is to stand far enough back from the ball so that your swing is free and you can clearly see the aiming line.  Finding the aiming line is easier if you are able to see your own ball and also the target ball in your peripheral vision, and therefore when you have taken your stance, your head should not be any further forward than the back of the striker's ball.  Once the aiming has been completed, the only thought should then be on striking your own ball with the centre of the mallet, and keeping your head down throughout the strike.



A roquet should be hit with a smooth strike and the mallet should be flat upon impact with the ball


Remember to ensure that whatever technique you use, it should be the same for roquets of any distance.  A good practice routine for roqueting is to take two sets of balls, and place each set 4-5 yards apart.  Take 4 shots.  If you hit them all, then extend the range to 5 yards and repeat.  Keep extending the range by a yard each time.

Rush
Not exactly what the name implies, there is nothing hurried about a rush! A rush is simply a
                        roquet but from
                        short range - indeed, sometimes a rush is referred to as a "roquet-rush". What sets a rush apart
                        from a
                        normal roquet is that instead of just trying to hit the target ball (as with a roquet), the aim
                        of the rush
                        is to send the target ball to a specific spot or area so that the next shot (a croquet stroke) is
                        played from
                        as easy a place as possible. 



A short rush. Notice that the mallet is parallel to the
                                    ground at
                                    point of contact


An example of this might be when your ball is 1-foot away from
                        another ball and
                        you would attempt to roquet the ball so that it stops near to your current hoop - from there you
                        could play
                        your croquet stroke from a position that is already close to your hoop!
A rush that is not in a straight line is referred to as a "cut rush", whereby you aim at a point on the object ball that is off-centre.  In exactly the same concept as in snooker or pool, when the centre of your ball hits the spot on the object ball, the object ball will travel in a direction in line with that spot.

The key to being a good croquet player is to avoid having to play difficult shots very often.
                        Mastering the
                        rush is a key part of achieving this goal.

Hoop Shot
When running a hoop, the same principle applies as with making a roquet. It is particularly
                        important here to
                        observe a smooth follow-through, because this will enable the ball to be imparted with natural
                        forward-spin
                        so that the ball is rolling - not skidding - when it reaches the hoop. Any minor misjudgement of
                        direction
                        of the shot may be alleviated by the forward spin that has been imparted. Conversely it you were
                        to jab at
                        the ball with a quick stabbing motion, it would negate any natural forward spin and cause the
                        ball to skid
                        along the ground - this can result in the ball stopping and sticking in the hoop upon contact
                        with the
                        hoop upright.
When running hoops from an angle, the key thing to remember is that the ball must miss the "near wire"
                        (the hoop upright closest to the ball) in order to run the hoop. Even a light brush against the
                        near wire will result in a failed hoop



Running an angled hoop.  The shot on the left will fail because the centre of the ball is aimed at the centre of the gap.  The shot on the right will succeed because the edge of the ball is aimed to just miss the near upright of the hoop.


While it is true that topspin can help a ball run a hoop, you must avoid the temptation to apply additional topspin via hitting down on the ball - doing so is likely to lead to inaccuracy with direction and also loss of control, and should
                        be reserved for only extreme angles where running the hoop would otherwise be very doubtful.

Croquet strokes

Takeoff
While the takeoff is technically a croquet stroke, in reality it is played in the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke. The main purpose of the takeoff is to position the striker's ball for its continuation
                        stroke, and
                        leave the croqueted ball more-or-less where it is. When playing the takeoff, you must remember
                        that the
                        croqueted ball has to move, otherwise it will not be a valid croquet stroke and incur
                        end-of-turn.

Blue plays a "thick" takeoff from red
                                



You can play a takeoff from either side of the croqueted ball. The amount by which the croqueted
                        ball moves
                        is determined by the angle towards the object ball at which you hit - a small inward angle will
                        result in what is
                        called a "fine" or "thin" takeoff, whereby the croqueted ball just moves maybe an inch or two.
                        If you hit in towards
                        the croqueted ball more, then more momentum will be transferred into it, moving it more -
                        resulting in
                        what's known as a "thick takeoff".
Note also that some natural side-spin will be imparted on the striker's ball due to having been
                        in contact
                        with the croqueted ball. After the striker's ball is struck, and as it slows down, it will curve
                        inwards
                        slightly, in the same direction that which the croqueted ball had been on.

Stop Shot
The stop shot is a croquet stroke which causes the striker's ball to move the shortest
                        distance in
                        relation to the croqueted ball. This is achieved by hitting slightly underneath the
                        centreline of
                        your ball, countering the natural forward spin which would be imparted when playing a normal
                        stroke. The
                        mallet is grounded upon impacting the ball and there is no follow-through. Because the mallet head is angled upward (as shown in the image), the mallet handle is angled slightly further back than normal, so in order to play the stop shot comfortably, you should stand with your feet slightly further back than you would for a normal stroke.
                       





Note the upward angle of the mallet face

Depending on the lawn, balls and mallet weight, ratios of anywhere between 1:5 and 1:10 (and
                        sometimes even
                        higher) can be achieved with a stop shot. It is a good idea to practise and become very familiar
                        with your
                        stop shot ratio, as the easiest way to play a well-controlled break is through the use of
                        accurate stop
                        shots and drives.
Although playing a stop shot is easy, a good technique is required to achieve a good ratio. Essentially the only shot where a smooth strike is unhelpful, it can take a while to master the timing involved in grounding the mallet at the exact moment of impact with the ball.
As mentioned above, you should stand further back from the ball when playing a stop shot because the whole mallet is angled slightly back.  Placement of the feet on this shot varies - some player will take a half-step back with both
                        feet, whereas others will keep one foot in the normal position with the other further behind,
                        rocking onto the back foot to achieve the same result.
Back to top




Drive
The drive is the simplest croquet stroke to play, as it is played exactly the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke - with a normal stance and a normal follow through. Although the ratio will always vary
                        depending on
                        a number of factors (lawn, ball composition and mallet weight), the standard ratio achieved with
                        a drive is
                        about 1:3.



The drive is played like a single-ball stroke
                            


As with the stop shot, it is important to develop a consistent and repeatable drive ratio,
                        because these two
                        strokes are the basis of solid and controlled break play.
                    
Back to top




Half Roll
The half roll is played by hitting slightly downwards onto your ball - this imparts a small
                        amount of extra
                        forward spin compared to a drive, enabling a ratio of about 1:2. In order to play the stroke
                        comfortably,
                        you should stand further forward than for a normal stroke, with your feet (or at least your
                        front foot)
                        about level with the striker's ball. Because you are standing closer to the ball than normal on this shot, moving both your hands down the mallet somewhat will make the shot easier to play, as it will give more control over the mallet and also make the backswing easier.  



The mallet strikes blue at a downward angle
                                to impart
                                additional topspin, increasing the distance blue travels


The half roll can easily be played centre-style, however some players choose to play this stroke
                        side-style
                        in order to generate more power. 
Back to top




Full Roll
The full roll is a croquet stroke where both balls travel approximately the same distance. It is
                        often used
                        as a recovery stroke. In order to get the
                        striker's ball
                        to travel the same distance as the croqueted ball, a lot of forward spin is needed to be
                        imparted on the
                        striker's ball - to achieve this, your hands need to drop a lot further down the mallet than
                        normal, and
                        the mallet should impact the striker's ball at a steeper angle than for a half roll.



The mallet strikes blue at a steep angle,
                                imparting high
                                topspin and causing both balls to travel a similar distance.


The full roll is often played side-style in order to generate enough power in the stroke.
                        However, if the
                        player has good timing and technique, it is possible to play this stroke centre-style. 
Back to top




Pass Roll
The pass roll is similar to the full roll, but the striker's ball travels even further than the croqueted ball. In order to achieve this, even more forward spin is required - as a consequence, the hands need to drop even further down
                        the mallet
                        than for the full roll. The pass roll needs to be played with more punch than the full roll, meaning that the mallet head must still be in the process of accellerating at the moment it makes contact with the ball.  To help achieve this, you can shorten the backswing and apply additional force to the forward swing.  
                    



The mallet strikes blue at an acute angle,
                                creating
                                maximum topspin


Like the full roll, the pass roll is often played side-style in order to generate the power and "punch" required to apply such topspin.  Because of the steep downward angle of the mallet
                        required to generate the necessary forward spin means standing very far forward, playing this stroke
                        centre-style will
                        give a very restricted backswing.  The placement of the bottom hand should be very close to the mallet head, but beware that touching the mallet head during the stroke is a fault.

Split Shot
A split shot is not a croquet stroke in its own right, but rather a variation of the croquet
                        strokes listed above. It can apply to anything from a stop shot through to a pass roll, and
                        refers to playing a croquet stroke where both balls go in different directions.



Line of aim is halfway between the two
                                intended destination points


For a given croquet stroke, the player should line the two balls up in a line of where they wish
                        the object ball to be sent. After determining the intended destination point for the striker's ball, you must aim at a point halfway between the two. The croqueted ball will actually "pull" slightly in the direction which you are playing the stroke, so some allowance needs to be made for that when lining up the two balls.
The wider the angle of split, the less "roll" (topspin) is required to be applied to the striker's
                        ball to get it to travel a given distance - knowing the amount of roll to apply comes with practice.

Special Shots
There are various shots that crop up during a game which are needed to recover from particular situations, such as when you have run a hoop but have a hampered backswing - and deserve special mention.  

Jump Shot
The jump stroke is a single-ball stroke in which you hit downwards onto your ball, causing it to
                        jump into
                        the air. There are a number of reasons for doing this, such as jumping over a ball lodged in
                        your hoop after
                        a failed peel, or jumping over a hoop to try and hit another ball. Perhaps the most common
                        scenario for
                        playing a jump stroke is to try and run a very angled hoop (e.g. from over 40deg) - hitting down
                        onto your ball imparts extra forward spin, and
                        this can be useful to coax a ball through what would otherwise be considered an unrunnable hoop.
                    



By striking down on the the blue, it is rebounded into
                                the air with a lot of topspin


There are a number of ways to play the jump stroke, depending on how high, and how sharply, you
                        need your
                        ball to rise off the ground. In general, the more sharply you hit down onto your ball, the
                        steeper the jump
                        angle. If you played the stroke with a fairly shallow downward angle, then the ball would rise
                        more
                        gradually over a longer distance compared to playing the stroke with sharper and more pronounced
                        downward angle. 
When using a jump shot to run a hoop, the most important thing is to miss the near wire of the
                        hoop. The additional topspin imparted by the jump shot will deter the ball from rebounding when
                        it makes contact with the hoop upright, and instead will keep spinning forwards and (hopefully)
                        through the hoop.

Sweep Shot
A sweep shot is used to get out of a hampered situation, normally after running a hoop and not having a clean swing at the reception ball.  It is played while kneeling on the court with the mallet held horizontally across the body, one hand near (but not touching) the mallet head and the other hand closer to the top of the handle.

The swing is in an arc shape, and is played in such a way that the hand closest to the mallet head will be moving forwards when the top hand is moving backwards, in a lever motion.  As a result, when the mallet face contacts the ball, it hits across the ball horizontally, imparting a small amount of side spin.  This in turn will help the ball curve slightly in the direction towards the intended target.  The line of aim should be at the outside edge of the target ball.
It is a shot worth practising both left-handed and right-handed, because either method may be required during a game, depending on the side of the hoop the mallet needs to swing.
There are a number of faults to look out for when playing a sweep shot, and some common ones include
                    
Touching the mallet head
Resting your arm on your leg
Resting a hand or arm on the ground
Hitting the ball with the corner of the mallet face

Cannon
A cannon is a shot involving 3 (or occasionally 4) balls.  The most common cannon is the Corner 1 cannon, where three balls will all be in the corner, each ball in contact with one other ball.  
A common scenario where a cannon might arise is when the striker rushes a ball into the corner area when there is already a ball on the corner spot.  The roqueted ball is lined back onto the court, in contact with the existing corner ball, on either boundary.  At that point the existing corner ball can be moved to any position around the roqueted ball in contact with it.  As the striker made a roquet, they must take croquet from the roqueted ball.  The striker's ball must not be in contact with the existing corner ball.
If the striker's ball is for hoop 1, then the aim of the Corner 1 cannon would be to croquet a pioneer ball towards hoop 2, and in the same shot roquet the third ball, rushing it to hoop 1.  This may sound somewhat complicated, but once you break it down it is actually fairly simple.





Blue rushes black into the corner square.  Red is a corner ball.  Black is replaced on the yardline in contact with red.

Exact line of aim will need to be adjusted for the player's mallet characteristics - generally a heavier mallet which is better at rolls would aim somewhere near hoop 6 whereas a light mallet that is good for stop shots would aim nearer to hoop 5.  For most players, it would be somewhere between the two.  The stroke is normally played as a drive, but again could be slightly adjusted depending upon mallet characteristics.

Shots
To borrow from John Prince's croquet video, "A famous player once remarked that hitting one's own
                        ball
                        correctly was the only difficult thing in croquet". 
Below you will find an overview of the shots involved in croquet, and some high-level guidance on how
                    to achieve them. More detailed information on specific strokes may also be found in the Technique section
If you have read the introduction section, or are already somewhat familiar with croquet, then you
                    will
                    realise that there are two basic types of stroke involved - single ball strokes and croquet
                    strokes.

Single-ball strokes

Roquet
A roquet is the act of hitting your ball onto another ball.  A roquet can be made at any distance, be it the length of the court, or from just a few inches.  Most of what is written in the Technique section covers how to play with a technique that you would use to make a roquet.
To reiterate, it is important to develop a smooth, unhurried swing.  The best way to do this is to stand far enough back from the ball so that your swing is free and you can clearly see the aiming line.  Finding the aiming line is easier if you are able to see your own ball and also the target ball in your peripheral vision, and therefore when you have taken your stance, your head should not be any further forward than the back of the striker's ball.  Once the aiming has been completed, the only thought should then be on striking your own ball with the centre of the mallet, and keeping your head down throughout the strike.



A roquet should be hit with a smooth strike and the mallet should be flat upon impact with the ball


Remember to ensure that whatever technique you use, it should be the same for roquets of any distance.  A good practice routine for roqueting is to take two sets of balls, and place each set 4-5 yards apart.  Take 4 shots.  If you hit them all, then extend the range to 5 yards and repeat.  Keep extending the range by a yard each time.

Rush
Not exactly what the name implies, there is nothing hurried about a rush! A rush is simply a
                        roquet but from
                        short range - indeed, sometimes a rush is referred to as a "roquet-rush". What sets a rush apart
                        from a
                        normal roquet is that instead of just trying to hit the target ball (as with a roquet), the aim
                        of the rush
                        is to send the target ball to a specific spot or area so that the next shot (a croquet stroke) is
                        played from
                        as easy a place as possible. 



A short rush. Notice that the mallet is parallel to the
                                    ground at
                                    point of contact


An example of this might be when your ball is 1-foot away from
                        another ball and
                        you would attempt to roquet the ball so that it stops near to your current hoop - from there you
                        could play
                        your croquet stroke from a position that is already close to your hoop!
A rush that is not in a straight line is referred to as a "cut rush", whereby you aim at a point on the object ball that is off-centre.  In exactly the same concept as in snooker or pool, when the centre of your ball hits the spot on the object ball, the object ball will travel in a direction in line with that spot.

The key to being a good croquet player is to avoid having to play difficult shots very often.
                        Mastering the
                        rush is a key part of achieving this goal.

Hoop Shot
When running a hoop, the same principle applies as with making a roquet. It is particularly
                        important here to
                        observe a smooth follow-through, because this will enable the ball to be imparted with natural
                        forward-spin
                        so that the ball is rolling - not skidding - when it reaches the hoop. Any minor misjudgement of
                        direction
                        of the shot may be alleviated by the forward spin that has been imparted. Conversely it you were
                        to jab at
                        the ball with a quick stabbing motion, it would negate any natural forward spin and cause the
                        ball to skid
                        along the ground - this can result in the ball stopping and sticking in the hoop upon contact
                        with the
                        hoop upright.
When running hoops from an angle, the key thing to remember is that the ball must miss the "near wire"
                        (the hoop upright closest to the ball) in order to run the hoop. Even a light brush against the
                        near wire will result in a failed hoop



Running an angled hoop.  The shot on the left will fail because the centre of the ball is aimed at the centre of the gap.  The shot on the right will succeed because the edge of the ball is aimed to just miss the near upright of the hoop.


While it is true that topspin can help a ball run a hoop, you must avoid the temptation to apply additional topspin via hitting down on the ball - doing so is likely to lead to inaccuracy with direction and also loss of control, and should
                        be reserved for only extreme angles where running the hoop would otherwise be very doubtful.

Croquet strokes

Takeoff
While the takeoff is technically a croquet stroke, in reality it is played in the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke. The main purpose of the takeoff is to position the striker's ball for its continuation
                        stroke, and
                        leave the croqueted ball more-or-less where it is. When playing the takeoff, you must remember
                        that the
                        croqueted ball has to move, otherwise it will not be a valid croquet stroke and incur
                        end-of-turn.

Blue plays a "thick" takeoff from red
                                



You can play a takeoff from either side of the croqueted ball. The amount by which the croqueted
                        ball moves
                        is determined by the angle towards the object ball at which you hit - a small inward angle will
                        result in what is
                        called a "fine" or "thin" takeoff, whereby the croqueted ball just moves maybe an inch or two.
                        If you hit in towards
                        the croqueted ball more, then more momentum will be transferred into it, moving it more -
                        resulting in
                        what's known as a "thick takeoff".
Note also that some natural side-spin will be imparted on the striker's ball due to having been
                        in contact
                        with the croqueted ball. After the striker's ball is struck, and as it slows down, it will curve
                        inwards
                        slightly, in the same direction that which the croqueted ball had been on.

Stop Shot
The stop shot is a croquet stroke which causes the striker's ball to move the shortest
                        distance in
                        relation to the croqueted ball. This is achieved by hitting slightly underneath the
                        centreline of
                        your ball, countering the natural forward spin which would be imparted when playing a normal
                        stroke. The
                        mallet is grounded upon impacting the ball and there is no follow-through. Because the mallet head is angled upward (as shown in the image), the mallet handle is angled slightly further back than normal, so in order to play the stop shot comfortably, you should stand with your feet slightly further back than you would for a normal stroke.
                       





Note the upward angle of the mallet face

Depending on the lawn, balls and mallet weight, ratios of anywhere between 1:5 and 1:10 (and
                        sometimes even
                        higher) can be achieved with a stop shot. It is a good idea to practise and become very familiar
                        with your
                        stop shot ratio, as the easiest way to play a well-controlled break is through the use of
                        accurate stop
                        shots and drives.
Although playing a stop shot is easy, a good technique is required to achieve a good ratio. Essentially the only shot where a smooth strike is unhelpful, it can take a while to master the timing involved in grounding the mallet at the exact moment of impact with the ball.
As mentioned above, you should stand further back from the ball when playing a stop shot because the whole mallet is angled slightly back.  Placement of the feet on this shot varies - some player will take a half-step back with both
                        feet, whereas others will keep one foot in the normal position with the other further behind,
                        rocking onto the back foot to achieve the same result.

Drive
The drive is the simplest croquet stroke to play, as it is played exactly the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke - with a normal stance and a normal follow through. Although the ratio will always vary
                        depending on
                        a number of factors (lawn, ball composition and mallet weight), the standard ratio achieved with
                        a drive is
                        about 1:3.



The drive is played like a single-ball stroke
                            


As with the stop shot, it is important to develop a consistent and repeatable drive ratio,
                        because these two
                        strokes are the basis of solid and controlled break play.
                    
Back to top




Half Roll
The half roll is played by hitting slightly downwards onto your ball - this imparts a small
                        amount of extra
                        forward spin compared to a drive, enabling a ratio of about 1:2. In order to play the stroke
                        comfortably,
                        you should stand further forward than for a normal stroke, with your feet (or at least your
                        front foot)
                        about level with the striker's ball. Because you are standing closer to the ball than normal on this shot, moving both your hands down the mallet somewhat will make the shot easier to play, as it will give more control over the mallet and also make the backswing easier.  



The mallet strikes blue at a downward angle
                                to impart
                                additional topspin, increasing the distance blue travels


The half roll can easily be played centre-style, however some players choose to play this stroke
                        side-style
                        in order to generate more power. 
Back to top




Full Roll
The full roll is a croquet stroke where both balls travel approximately the same distance. It is
                        often used
                        as a recovery stroke. In order to get the
                        striker's ball
                        to travel the same distance as the croqueted ball, a lot of forward spin is needed to be
                        imparted on the
                        striker's ball - to achieve this, your hands need to drop a lot further down the mallet than
                        normal, and
                        the mallet should impact the striker's ball at a steeper angle than for a half roll.



The mallet strikes blue at a steep angle,
                                imparting high
                                topspin and causing both balls to travel a similar distance.


The full roll is often played side-style in order to generate enough power in the stroke.
                        However, if the
                        player has good timing and technique, it is possible to play this stroke centre-style. 
Back to top




Pass Roll
The pass roll is similar to the full roll, but the striker's ball travels even further than the croqueted ball. In order to achieve this, even more forward spin is required - as a consequence, the hands need to drop even further down
                        the mallet
                        than for the full roll. The pass roll needs to be played with more punch than the full roll, meaning that the mallet head must still be in the process of accellerating at the moment it makes contact with the ball.  To help achieve this, you can shorten the backswing and apply additional force to the forward swing.  
                    



The mallet strikes blue at an acute angle,
                                creating
                                maximum topspin


Like the full roll, the pass roll is often played side-style in order to generate the power and "punch" required to apply such topspin.  Because of the steep downward angle of the mallet
                        required to generate the necessary forward spin means standing very far forward, playing this stroke
                        centre-style will
                        give a very restricted backswing.  The placement of the bottom hand should be very close to the mallet head, but beware that touching the mallet head during the stroke is a fault.
                    
Back to top




Split Shot
A split shot is not a croquet stroke in its own right, but rather a variation of the croquet
                        strokes listed above. It can apply to anything from a stop shot through to a pass roll, and
                        refers to playing a croquet stroke where both balls go in different directions.



Line of aim is halfway between the two
                                intended destination points


For a given croquet stroke, the player should line the two balls up in a line of where they wish
                        the object ball to be sent. After determining the intended destination point for the striker's ball, you must aim at a point halfway between the two. The croqueted ball will actually "pull" slightly in the direction which you are playing the stroke, so some allowance needs to be made for that when lining up the two balls.
The wider the angle of split, the less "roll" (topspin) is required to be applied to the striker's
                        ball to get it to travel a given distance - knowing the amount of roll to apply comes with practice.

Special Shots
There are various shots that crop up during a game which are needed to recover from particular situations, such as when you have run a hoop but have a hampered backswing - and deserve special mention.  

Jump Shot
The jump stroke is a single-ball stroke in which you hit downwards onto your ball, causing it to
                        jump into
                        the air. There are a number of reasons for doing this, such as jumping over a ball lodged in
                        your hoop after
                        a failed peel, or jumping over a hoop to try and hit another ball. Perhaps the most common
                        scenario for
                        playing a jump stroke is to try and run a very angled hoop (e.g. from over 40deg) - hitting down
                        onto your ball imparts extra forward spin, and
                        this can be useful to coax a ball through what would otherwise be considered an unrunnable hoop.
                    



By striking down on the the blue, it is rebounded into
                                the air with a lot of topspin


There are a number of ways to play the jump stroke, depending on how high, and how sharply, you
                        need your
                        ball to rise off the ground. In general, the more sharply you hit down onto your ball, the
                        steeper the jump
                        angle. If you played the stroke with a fairly shallow downward angle, then the ball would rise
                        more
                        gradually over a longer distance compared to playing the stroke with sharper and more pronounced
                        downward angle. 
When using a jump shot to run a hoop, the most important thing is to miss the near wire of the
                        hoop. The additional topspin imparted by the jump shot will deter the ball from rebounding when
                        it makes contact with the hoop upright, and instead will keep spinning forwards and (hopefully)
                        through the hoop.

Sweep Shot
A sweep shot is used to get out of a hampered situation, normally after running a hoop and not having a clean swing at the reception ball.  It is played while kneeling on the court with the mallet held horizontally across the body, one hand near (but not touching) the mallet head and the other hand closer to the top of the handle.

The swing is in an arc shape, and is played in such a way that the hand closest to the mallet head will be moving forwards when the top hand is moving backwards, in a lever motion.  As a result, when the mallet face contacts the ball, it hits across the ball horizontally, imparting a small amount of side spin.  This in turn will help the ball curve slightly in the direction towards the intended target.  The line of aim should be at the outside edge of the target ball.
It is a shot worth practising both left-handed and right-handed, because either method may be required during a game, depending on the side of the hoop the mallet needs to swing.
There are a number of faults to look out for when playing a sweep shot, and some common ones include
                    
Touching the mallet head
Resting your arm on your leg
Resting a hand or arm on the ground
Hitting the ball with the corner of the mallet face

Cannon
A cannon is a shot involving 3 (or occasionally 4) balls.  The most common cannon is the Corner 1 cannon, where three balls will all be in the corner, each ball in contact with one other ball.  
A common scenario where a cannon might arise is when the striker rushes a ball into the corner area when there is already a ball on the corner spot.  The roqueted ball is lined back onto the court, in contact with the existing corner ball, on either boundary.  At that point the existing corner ball can be moved to any position around the roqueted ball in contact with it.  As the striker made a roquet, they must take croquet from the roqueted ball.  The striker's ball must not be in contact with the existing corner ball.
If the striker's ball is for hoop 1, then the aim of the Corner 1 cannon would be to croquet a pioneer ball towards hoop 2, and in the same shot roquet the third ball, rushing it to hoop 1.  This may sound somewhat complicated, but once you break it down it is actually fairly simple.





Blue rushes black into the corner square.  Red is a corner ball.  Black is replaced on the yardline in contact with red.

Exact line of aim will need to be adjusted for the player's mallet characteristics - generally a heavier mallet which is better at rolls would aim somewhere near hoop 6 whereas a light mallet that is good for stop shots would aim nearer to hoop 5.  For most players, it would be somewhere between the two.  The stroke is normally played as a drive, but again could be slightly adjusted depending upon mallet characteristics.

Shots
To borrow from John Prince's croquet video, "A famous player once remarked that hitting one's own
                        ball
                        correctly was the only difficult thing in croquet". 
Below you will find an overview of the shots involved in croquet, and some high-level guidance on how
                    to achieve them. More detailed information on specific strokes may also be found in the Technique section
If you have read the introduction section, or are already somewhat familiar with croquet, then you
                    will
                    realise that there are two basic types of stroke involved - single ball strokes and croquet
                    strokes.

Single-ball strokes

Roquet
A roquet is the act of hitting your ball onto another ball.  A roquet can be made at any distance, be it the length of the court, or from just a few inches.  Most of what is written in the Technique section covers how to play with a technique that you would use to make a roquet.
To reiterate, it is important to develop a smooth, unhurried swing.  The best way to do this is to stand far enough back from the ball so that your swing is free and you can clearly see the aiming line.  Finding the aiming line is easier if you are able to see your own ball and also the target ball in your peripheral vision, and therefore when you have taken your stance, your head should not be any further forward than the back of the striker's ball.  Once the aiming has been completed, the only thought should then be on striking your own ball with the centre of the mallet, and keeping your head down throughout the strike.



A roquet should be hit with a smooth strike and the mallet should be flat upon impact with the ball


Remember to ensure that whatever technique you use, it should be the same for roquets of any distance.  A good practice routine for roqueting is to take two sets of balls, and place each set 4-5 yards apart.  Take 4 shots.  If you hit them all, then extend the range to 5 yards and repeat.  Keep extending the range by a yard each time.

Rush
Not exactly what the name implies, there is nothing hurried about a rush! A rush is simply a
                        roquet but from
                        short range - indeed, sometimes a rush is referred to as a "roquet-rush". What sets a rush apart
                        from a
                        normal roquet is that instead of just trying to hit the target ball (as with a roquet), the aim
                        of the rush
                        is to send the target ball to a specific spot or area so that the next shot (a croquet stroke) is
                        played from
                        as easy a place as possible. 



A short rush. Notice that the mallet is parallel to the
                                    ground at
                                    point of contact


An example of this might be when your ball is 1-foot away from
                        another ball and
                        you would attempt to roquet the ball so that it stops near to your current hoop - from there you
                        could play
                        your croquet stroke from a position that is already close to your hoop!
A rush that is not in a straight line is referred to as a "cut rush", whereby you aim at a point on the object ball that is off-centre.  In exactly the same concept as in snooker or pool, when the centre of your ball hits the spot on the object ball, the object ball will travel in a direction in line with that spot.

The key to being a good croquet player is to avoid having to play difficult shots very often.
                        Mastering the
                        rush is a key part of achieving this goal.

Hoop Shot
When running a hoop, the same principle applies as with making a roquet. It is particularly
                        important here to
                        observe a smooth follow-through, because this will enable the ball to be imparted with natural
                        forward-spin
                        so that the ball is rolling - not skidding - when it reaches the hoop. Any minor misjudgement of
                        direction
                        of the shot may be alleviated by the forward spin that has been imparted. Conversely it you were
                        to jab at
                        the ball with a quick stabbing motion, it would negate any natural forward spin and cause the
                        ball to skid
                        along the ground - this can result in the ball stopping and sticking in the hoop upon contact
                        with the
                        hoop upright.
When running hoops from an angle, the key thing to remember is that the ball must miss the "near wire"
                        (the hoop upright closest to the ball) in order to run the hoop. Even a light brush against the
                        near wire will result in a failed hoop



Running an angled hoop.  The shot on the left will fail because the centre of the ball is aimed at the centre of the gap.  The shot on the right will succeed because the edge of the ball is aimed to just miss the near upright of the hoop.


While it is true that topspin can help a ball run a hoop, you must avoid the temptation to apply additional topspin via hitting down on the ball - doing so is likely to lead to inaccuracy with direction and also loss of control, and should
                        be reserved for only extreme angles where running the hoop would otherwise be very doubtful.

Croquet strokes

Takeoff
While the takeoff is technically a croquet stroke, in reality it is played in the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke. The main purpose of the takeoff is to position the striker's ball for its continuation
                        stroke, and
                        leave the croqueted ball more-or-less where it is. When playing the takeoff, you must remember
                        that the
                        croqueted ball has to move, otherwise it will not be a valid croquet stroke and incur
                        end-of-turn.

Blue plays a "thick" takeoff from red
                                



You can play a takeoff from either side of the croqueted ball. The amount by which the croqueted
                        ball moves
                        is determined by the angle towards the object ball at which you hit - a small inward angle will
                        result in what is
                        called a "fine" or "thin" takeoff, whereby the croqueted ball just moves maybe an inch or two.
                        If you hit in towards
                        the croqueted ball more, then more momentum will be transferred into it, moving it more -
                        resulting in
                        what's known as a "thick takeoff".
Note also that some natural side-spin will be imparted on the striker's ball due to having been
                        in contact
                        with the croqueted ball. After the striker's ball is struck, and as it slows down, it will curve
                        inwards
                        slightly, in the same direction that which the croqueted ball had been on.

Stop Shot
The stop shot is a croquet stroke which causes the striker's ball to move the shortest
                        distance in
                        relation to the croqueted ball. This is achieved by hitting slightly underneath the
                        centreline of
                        your ball, countering the natural forward spin which would be imparted when playing a normal
                        stroke. The
                        mallet is grounded upon impacting the ball and there is no follow-through. Because the mallet head is angled upward (as shown in the image), the mallet handle is angled slightly further back than normal, so in order to play the stop shot comfortably, you should stand with your feet slightly further back than you would for a normal stroke.
                       





Note the upward angle of the mallet face

Depending on the lawn, balls and mallet weight, ratios of anywhere between 1:5 and 1:10 (and
                        sometimes even
                        higher) can be achieved with a stop shot. It is a good idea to practise and become very familiar
                        with your
                        stop shot ratio, as the easiest way to play a well-controlled break is through the use of
                        accurate stop
                        shots and drives.
Although playing a stop shot is easy, a good technique is required to achieve a good ratio. Essentially the only shot where a smooth strike is unhelpful, it can take a while to master the timing involved in grounding the mallet at the exact moment of impact with the ball.
As mentioned above, you should stand further back from the ball when playing a stop shot because the whole mallet is angled slightly back.  Placement of the feet on this shot varies - some player will take a half-step back with both
                        feet, whereas others will keep one foot in the normal position with the other further behind,
                        rocking onto the back foot to achieve the same result.

Drive
The drive is the simplest croquet stroke to play, as it is played exactly the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke - with a normal stance and a normal follow through. Although the ratio will always vary
                        depending on
                        a number of factors (lawn, ball composition and mallet weight), the standard ratio achieved with
                        a drive is
                        about 1:3.



The drive is played like a single-ball stroke
                            


As with the stop shot, it is important to develop a consistent and repeatable drive ratio,
                        because these two
                        strokes are the basis of solid and controlled break play.
                    
Back to top




Half Roll
The half roll is played by hitting slightly downwards onto your ball - this imparts a small
                        amount of extra
                        forward spin compared to a drive, enabling a ratio of about 1:2. In order to play the stroke
                        comfortably,
                        you should stand further forward than for a normal stroke, with your feet (or at least your
                        front foot)
                        about level with the striker's ball. Because you are standing closer to the ball than normal on this shot, moving both your hands down the mallet somewhat will make the shot easier to play, as it will give more control over the mallet and also make the backswing easier.  



The mallet strikes blue at a downward angle
                                to impart
                                additional topspin, increasing the distance blue travels


The half roll can easily be played centre-style, however some players choose to play this stroke
                        side-style
                        in order to generate more power. 
Back to top




Full Roll
The full roll is a croquet stroke where both balls travel approximately the same distance. It is
                        often used
                        as a recovery stroke. In order to get the
                        striker's ball
                        to travel the same distance as the croqueted ball, a lot of forward spin is needed to be
                        imparted on the
                        striker's ball - to achieve this, your hands need to drop a lot further down the mallet than
                        normal, and
                        the mallet should impact the striker's ball at a steeper angle than for a half roll.



The mallet strikes blue at a steep angle,
                                imparting high
                                topspin and causing both balls to travel a similar distance.


The full roll is often played side-style in order to generate enough power in the stroke.
                        However, if the
                        player has good timing and technique, it is possible to play this stroke centre-style. 
Back to top




Pass Roll
The pass roll is similar to the full roll, but the striker's ball travels even further than the croqueted ball. In order to achieve this, even more forward spin is required - as a consequence, the hands need to drop even further down
                        the mallet
                        than for the full roll. The pass roll needs to be played with more punch than the full roll, meaning that the mallet head must still be in the process of accellerating at the moment it makes contact with the ball.  To help achieve this, you can shorten the backswing and apply additional force to the forward swing.  
                    



The mallet strikes blue at an acute angle,
                                creating
                                maximum topspin


Like the full roll, the pass roll is often played side-style in order to generate the power and "punch" required to apply such topspin.  Because of the steep downward angle of the mallet
                        required to generate the necessary forward spin means standing very far forward, playing this stroke
                        centre-style will
                        give a very restricted backswing.  The placement of the bottom hand should be very close to the mallet head, but beware that touching the mallet head during the stroke is a fault.
                    
Back to top




Split Shot
A split shot is not a croquet stroke in its own right, but rather a variation of the croquet
                        strokes listed above. It can apply to anything from a stop shot through to a pass roll, and
                        refers to playing a croquet stroke where both balls go in different directions.



Line of aim is halfway between the two
                                intended destination points


For a given croquet stroke, the player should line the two balls up in a line of where they wish
                        the object ball to be sent. After determining the intended destination point for the striker's ball, you must aim at a point halfway between the two. The croqueted ball will actually "pull" slightly in the direction which you are playing the stroke, so some allowance needs to be made for that when lining up the two balls.
The wider the angle of split, the less "roll" (topspin) is required to be applied to the striker's
                        ball to get it to travel a given distance - knowing the amount of roll to apply comes with practice.

Special Shots
There are various shots that crop up during a game which are needed to recover from particular situations, such as when you have run a hoop but have a hampered backswing - and deserve special mention.  

Jump Shot
The jump stroke is a single-ball stroke in which you hit downwards onto your ball, causing it to
                        jump into
                        the air. There are a number of reasons for doing this, such as jumping over a ball lodged in
                        your hoop after
                        a failed peel, or jumping over a hoop to try and hit another ball. Perhaps the most common
                        scenario for
                        playing a jump stroke is to try and run a very angled hoop (e.g. from over 40deg) - hitting down
                        onto your ball imparts extra forward spin, and
                        this can be useful to coax a ball through what would otherwise be considered an unrunnable hoop.
                    



By striking down on the the blue, it is rebounded into
                                the air with a lot of topspin


There are a number of ways to play the jump stroke, depending on how high, and how sharply, you
                        need your
                        ball to rise off the ground. In general, the more sharply you hit down onto your ball, the
                        steeper the jump
                        angle. If you played the stroke with a fairly shallow downward angle, then the ball would rise
                        more
                        gradually over a longer distance compared to playing the stroke with sharper and more pronounced
                        downward angle. 
When using a jump shot to run a hoop, the most important thing is to miss the near wire of the
                        hoop. The additional topspin imparted by the jump shot will deter the ball from rebounding when
                        it makes contact with the hoop upright, and instead will keep spinning forwards and (hopefully)
                        through the hoop.

Sweep Shot
A sweep shot is used to get out of a hampered situation, normally after running a hoop and not having a clean swing at the reception ball.  It is played while kneeling on the court with the mallet held horizontally across the body, one hand near (but not touching) the mallet head and the other hand closer to the top of the handle.



Sweep shot after blue has run the hoop, hampered from red


The swing is in an arc shape, and is played in such a way that the hand closest to the mallet head will be moving forwards when the top hand is moving backwards, in a lever motion.  As a result, when the mallet face contacts the ball, it hits across the ball horizontally, imparting a small amount of side spin.  This in turn will help the ball curve slightly in the direction towards the intended target.  The line of aim should be at the outside edge of the target ball.
It is a shot worth practising both left-handed and right-handed, because either method may be required during a game, depending on the side of the hoop the mallet needs to swing.
There are a number of faults to look out for when playing a sweep shot, and some common ones include
                    
Touching the mallet head
Resting your arm on your leg
Resting a hand or arm on the ground
Hitting the ball with the corner of the mallet face


Back to top




Cannon
A cannon is a shot involving 3 (or occasionally 4) balls.  The most common cannon is the Corner 1 cannon, where three balls will all be in the corner, each ball in contact with one other ball.  
A common scenario where a cannon might arise is when the striker rushes a ball into the corner area when there is already a ball on the corner spot.  The roqueted ball is lined back onto the court, in contact with the existing corner ball, on either boundary.  At that point the existing corner ball can be moved to any position around the roqueted ball in contact with it.  As the striker made a roquet, they must take croquet from the roqueted ball.  The striker's ball must not be in contact with the existing corner ball.
If the striker's ball is for hoop 1, then the aim of the Corner 1 cannon would be to croquet a pioneer ball towards hoop 2, and in the same shot roquet the third ball, rushing it to hoop 1.  This may sound somewhat complicated, but once you break it down it is actually fairly simple.

Exact line of aim will need to be adjusted for the player's mallet characteristics - generally a heavier mallet which is better at rolls would aim somewhere near hoop 6 whereas a light mallet that is good for stop shots would aim nearer to hoop 5.  For most players, it would be somewhere between the two.  The stroke is normally played as a drive, but again could be slightly adjusted depending upon mallet characteristics.

Shots
To borrow from John Prince's croquet video, "A famous player once remarked that hitting one's own
                        ball
                        correctly was the only difficult thing in croquet". 
Below you will find an overview of the shots involved in croquet, and some high-level guidance on how
                    to achieve them. More detailed information on specific strokes may also be found in the Technique section
If you have read the introduction section, or are already somewhat familiar with croquet, then you
                    will
                    realise that there are two basic types of stroke involved - single ball strokes and croquet
                    strokes.

Single-ball strokes

Roquet
A roquet is the act of hitting your ball onto another ball.  A roquet can be made at any distance, be it the length of the court, or from just a few inches.  Most of what is written in the Technique section covers how to play with a technique that you would use to make a roquet.
To reiterate, it is important to develop a smooth, unhurried swing.  The best way to do this is to stand far enough back from the ball so that your swing is free and you can clearly see the aiming line.  Finding the aiming line is easier if you are able to see your own ball and also the target ball in your peripheral vision, and therefore when you have taken your stance, your head should not be any further forward than the back of the striker's ball.  Once the aiming has been completed, the only thought should then be on striking your own ball with the centre of the mallet, and keeping your head down throughout the strike.



A roquet should be hit with a smooth strike and the mallet should be flat upon impact with the ball


Remember to ensure that whatever technique you use, it should be the same for roquets of any distance.  A good practice routine for roqueting is to take two sets of balls, and place each set 4-5 yards apart.  Take 4 shots.  If you hit them all, then extend the range to 5 yards and repeat.  Keep extending the range by a yard each time.

Rush
Not exactly what the name implies, there is nothing hurried about a rush! A rush is simply a
                        roquet but from
                        short range - indeed, sometimes a rush is referred to as a "roquet-rush". What sets a rush apart
                        from a
                        normal roquet is that instead of just trying to hit the target ball (as with a roquet), the aim
                        of the rush
                        is to send the target ball to a specific spot or area so that the next shot (a croquet stroke) is
                        played from
                        as easy a place as possible. 



A short rush. Notice that the mallet is parallel to the
                                    ground at
                                    point of contact


An example of this might be when your ball is 1-foot away from
                        another ball and
                        you would attempt to roquet the ball so that it stops near to your current hoop - from there you
                        could play
                        your croquet stroke from a position that is already close to your hoop!
A rush that is not in a straight line is referred to as a "cut rush", whereby you aim at a point on the object ball that is off-centre.  In exactly the same concept as in snooker or pool, when the centre of your ball hits the spot on the object ball, the object ball will travel in a direction in line with that spot.

The key to being a good croquet player is to avoid having to play difficult shots very often.
                        Mastering the
                        rush is a key part of achieving this goal.

Hoop Shot
When running a hoop, the same principle applies as with making a roquet. It is particularly
                        important here to
                        observe a smooth follow-through, because this will enable the ball to be imparted with natural
                        forward-spin
                        so that the ball is rolling - not skidding - when it reaches the hoop. Any minor misjudgement of
                        direction
                        of the shot may be alleviated by the forward spin that has been imparted. Conversely it you were
                        to jab at
                        the ball with a quick stabbing motion, it would negate any natural forward spin and cause the
                        ball to skid
                        along the ground - this can result in the ball stopping and sticking in the hoop upon contact
                        with the
                        hoop upright.
When running hoops from an angle, the key thing to remember is that the ball must miss the "near wire"
                        (the hoop upright closest to the ball) in order to run the hoop. Even a light brush against the
                        near wire will result in a failed hoop



Running an angled hoop.  The shot on the left will fail because the centre of the ball is aimed at the centre of the gap.  The shot on the right will succeed because the edge of the ball is aimed to just miss the near upright of the hoop.


While it is true that topspin can help a ball run a hoop, you must avoid the temptation to apply additional topspin via hitting down on the ball - doing so is likely to lead to inaccuracy with direction and also loss of control, and should
                        be reserved for only extreme angles where running the hoop would otherwise be very doubtful.

Croquet strokes

Takeoff
While the takeoff is technically a croquet stroke, in reality it is played in the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke. The main purpose of the takeoff is to position the striker's ball for its continuation
                        stroke, and
                        leave the croqueted ball more-or-less where it is. When playing the takeoff, you must remember
                        that the
                        croqueted ball has to move, otherwise it will not be a valid croquet stroke and incur
                        end-of-turn.

Blue plays a "thick" takeoff from red
                                



You can play a takeoff from either side of the croqueted ball. The amount by which the croqueted
                        ball moves
                        is determined by the angle towards the object ball at which you hit - a small inward angle will
                        result in what is
                        called a "fine" or "thin" takeoff, whereby the croqueted ball just moves maybe an inch or two.
                        If you hit in towards
                        the croqueted ball more, then more momentum will be transferred into it, moving it more -
                        resulting in
                        what's known as a "thick takeoff".
Note also that some natural side-spin will be imparted on the striker's ball due to having been
                        in contact
                        with the croqueted ball. After the striker's ball is struck, and as it slows down, it will curve
                        inwards
                        slightly, in the same direction that which the croqueted ball had been on.

Stop Shot
The stop shot is a croquet stroke which causes the striker's ball to move the shortest
                        distance in
                        relation to the croqueted ball. This is achieved by hitting slightly underneath the
                        centreline of
                        your ball, countering the natural forward spin which would be imparted when playing a normal
                        stroke. The
                        mallet is grounded upon impacting the ball and there is no follow-through. Because the mallet head is angled upward (as shown in the image), the mallet handle is angled slightly further back than normal, so in order to play the stop shot comfortably, you should stand with your feet slightly further back than you would for a normal stroke.
                       





Note the upward angle of the mallet face

Depending on the lawn, balls and mallet weight, ratios of anywhere between 1:5 and 1:10 (and
                        sometimes even
                        higher) can be achieved with a stop shot. It is a good idea to practise and become very familiar
                        with your
                        stop shot ratio, as the easiest way to play a well-controlled break is through the use of
                        accurate stop
                        shots and drives.
Although playing a stop shot is easy, a good technique is required to achieve a good ratio. Essentially the only shot where a smooth strike is unhelpful, it can take a while to master the timing involved in grounding the mallet at the exact moment of impact with the ball.
As mentioned above, you should stand further back from the ball when playing a stop shot because the whole mallet is angled slightly back.  Placement of the feet on this shot varies - some player will take a half-step back with both
                        feet, whereas others will keep one foot in the normal position with the other further behind,
                        rocking onto the back foot to achieve the same result.
Back to top




Drive
The drive is the simplest croquet stroke to play, as it is played exactly the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke - with a normal stance and a normal follow through. Although the ratio will always vary
                        depending on
                        a number of factors (lawn, ball composition and mallet weight), the standard ratio achieved with
                        a drive is
                        about 1:3.



The drive is played like a single-ball stroke
                            


As with the stop shot, it is important to develop a consistent and repeatable drive ratio,
                        because these two
                        strokes are the basis of solid and controlled break play.
                    
Back to top




Half Roll
The half roll is played by hitting slightly downwards onto your ball - this imparts a small
                        amount of extra
                        forward spin compared to a drive, enabling a ratio of about 1:2. In order to play the stroke
                        comfortably,
                        you should stand further forward than for a normal stroke, with your feet (or at least your
                        front foot)
                        about level with the striker's ball. Because you are standing closer to the ball than normal on this shot, moving both your hands down the mallet somewhat will make the shot easier to play, as it will give more control over the mallet and also make the backswing easier.  



The mallet strikes blue at a downward angle
                                to impart
                                additional topspin, increasing the distance blue travels


The half roll can easily be played centre-style, however some players choose to play this stroke
                        side-style
                        in order to generate more power. 
Back to top




Full Roll
The full roll is a croquet stroke where both balls travel approximately the same distance. It is
                        often used
                        as a recovery stroke. In order to get the
                        striker's ball
                        to travel the same distance as the croqueted ball, a lot of forward spin is needed to be
                        imparted on the
                        striker's ball - to achieve this, your hands need to drop a lot further down the mallet than
                        normal, and
                        the mallet should impact the striker's ball at a steeper angle than for a half roll.



The mallet strikes blue at a steep angle,
                                imparting high
                                topspin and causing both balls to travel a similar distance.


The full roll is often played side-style in order to generate enough power in the stroke.
                        However, if the
                        player has good timing and technique, it is possible to play this stroke centre-style. 
Back to top




Pass Roll
The pass roll is similar to the full roll, but the striker's ball travels even further than the croqueted ball. In order to achieve this, even more forward spin is required - as a consequence, the hands need to drop even further down
                        the mallet
                        than for the full roll. The pass roll needs to be played with more punch than the full roll, meaning that the mallet head must still be in the process of accellerating at the moment it makes contact with the ball.  To help achieve this, you can shorten the backswing and apply additional force to the forward swing.  
                    



The mallet strikes blue at an acute angle,
                                creating
                                maximum topspin


Like the full roll, the pass roll is often played side-style in order to generate the power and "punch" required to apply such topspin.  Because of the steep downward angle of the mallet
                        required to generate the necessary forward spin means standing very far forward, playing this stroke
                        centre-style will
                        give a very restricted backswing.  The placement of the bottom hand should be very close to the mallet head, but beware that touching the mallet head during the stroke is a fault.
                    
Back to top




Split Shot
A split shot is not a croquet stroke in its own right, but rather a variation of the croquet
                        strokes listed above. It can apply to anything from a stop shot through to a pass roll, and
                        refers to playing a croquet stroke where both balls go in different directions.



Line of aim is halfway between the two
                                intended destination points


For a given croquet stroke, the player should line the two balls up in a line of where they wish
                        the object ball to be sent. After determining the intended destination point for the striker's ball, you must aim at a point halfway between the two. The croqueted ball will actually "pull" slightly in the direction which you are playing the stroke, so some allowance needs to be made for that when lining up the two balls.
The wider the angle of split, the less "roll" (topspin) is required to be applied to the striker's
                        ball to get it to travel a given distance - knowing the amount of roll to apply comes with practice.  
Back to top




Special Shots
There are various shots that crop up during a game which are needed to recover from particular situations, such as when you have run a hoop but have a hampered backswing - and deserve special mention.  

Jump Shot
The jump stroke is a single-ball stroke in which you hit downwards onto your ball, causing it to
                        jump into
                        the air. There are a number of reasons for doing this, such as jumping over a ball lodged in
                        your hoop after
                        a failed peel, or jumping over a hoop to try and hit another ball. Perhaps the most common
                        scenario for
                        playing a jump stroke is to try and run a very angled hoop (e.g. from over 40deg) - hitting down
                        onto your ball imparts extra forward spin, and
                        this can be useful to coax a ball through what would otherwise be considered an unrunnable hoop.
                    



By striking down on the the blue, it is rebounded into
                                the air with a lot of topspin


There are a number of ways to play the jump stroke, depending on how high, and how sharply, you
                        need your
                        ball to rise off the ground. In general, the more sharply you hit down onto your ball, the
                        steeper the jump
                        angle. If you played the stroke with a fairly shallow downward angle, then the ball would rise
                        more
                        gradually over a longer distance compared to playing the stroke with sharper and more pronounced
                        downward angle. 
When using a jump shot to run a hoop, the most important thing is to miss the near wire of the
                        hoop. The additional topspin imparted by the jump shot will deter the ball from rebounding when
                        it makes contact with the hoop upright, and instead will keep spinning forwards and (hopefully)
                        through the hoop.
Back to top




Sweep Shot
A sweep shot is used to get out of a hampered situation, normally after running a hoop and not having a clean swing at the reception ball.  It is played while kneeling on the court with the mallet held horizontally across the body, one hand near (but not touching) the mallet head and the other hand closer to the top of the handle.



Sweep shot after blue has run the hoop, hampered from red


The swing is in an arc shape, and is played in such a way that the hand closest to the mallet head will be moving forwards when the top hand is moving backwards, in a lever motion.  As a result, when the mallet face contacts the ball, it hits across the ball horizontally, imparting a small amount of side spin.  This in turn will help the ball curve slightly in the direction towards the intended target.  The line of aim should be at the outside edge of the target ball.
It is a shot worth practising both left-handed and right-handed, because either method may be required during a game, depending on the side of the hoop the mallet needs to swing.
There are a number of faults to look out for when playing a sweep shot, and some common ones include
                    
Touching the mallet head
Resting your arm on your leg
Resting a hand or arm on the ground
Hitting the ball with the corner of the mallet face


Back to top




Cannon
A cannon is a shot involving 3 (or occasionally 4) balls.  The most common cannon is the Corner 1 cannon, where three balls will all be in the corner, each ball in contact with one other ball.  
A common scenario where a cannon might arise is when the striker rushes a ball into the corner area when there is already a ball on the corner spot.  The roqueted ball is lined back onto the court, in contact with the existing corner ball, on either boundary.  At that point the existing corner ball can be moved to any position around the roqueted ball in contact with it.  As the striker made a roquet, they must take croquet from the roqueted ball.  The striker's ball must not be in contact with the existing corner ball.
If the striker's ball is for hoop 1, then the aim of the Corner 1 cannon would be to croquet a pioneer ball towards hoop 2, and in the same shot roquet the third ball, rushing it to hoop 1.  This may sound somewhat complicated, but once you break it down it is actually fairly simple.

Exact line of aim will need to be adjusted for the player's mallet characteristics - generally a heavier mallet which is better at rolls would aim somewhere near hoop 6 whereas a light mallet that is good for stop shots would aim nearer to hoop 5.  For most players, it would be somewhere between the two.  The stroke is normally played as a drive, but again could be slightly adjusted depending upon mallet characteristics.

                        ball
                        correctly was the only difficult thing in croquet". 
Below you will find an overview of the shots involved in croquet, and some high-level guidance on how
                    to achieve them. More detailed information on specific strokes may also be found in the Technique section
If you have read the introduction section, or are already somewhat familiar with croquet, then you
                    will
                    realise that there are two basic types of stroke involved - single ball strokes and croquet
                    strokes.

Single-ball strokes

Roquet
A roquet is the act of hitting your ball onto another ball.  A roquet can be made at any distance, be it the length of the court, or from just a few inches.  Most of what is written in the Technique section covers how to play with a technique that you would use to make a roquet.
To reiterate, it is important to develop a smooth, unhurried swing.  The best way to do this is to stand far enough back from the ball so that your swing is free and you can clearly see the aiming line.  Finding the aiming line is easier if you are able to see your own ball and also the target ball in your peripheral vision, and therefore when you have taken your stance, your head should not be any further forward than the back of the striker's ball.  Once the aiming has been completed, the only thought should then be on striking your own ball with the centre of the mallet, and keeping your head down throughout the strike.



A roquet should be hit with a smooth strike and the mallet should be flat upon impact with the ball


Remember to ensure that whatever technique you use, it should be the same for roquets of any distance.  A good practice routine for roqueting is to take two sets of balls, and place each set 4-5 yards apart.  Take 4 shots.  If you hit them all, then extend the range to 5 yards and repeat.  Keep extending the range by a yard each time.

Rush
Not exactly what the name implies, there is nothing hurried about a rush! A rush is simply a
                        roquet but from
                        short range - indeed, sometimes a rush is referred to as a "roquet-rush". What sets a rush apart
                        from a
                        normal roquet is that instead of just trying to hit the target ball (as with a roquet), the aim
                        of the rush
                        is to send the target ball to a specific spot or area so that the next shot (a croquet stroke) is
                        played from
                        as easy a place as possible. 



A short rush. Notice that the mallet is parallel to the
                                    ground at
                                    point of contact


An example of this might be when your ball is 1-foot away from
                        another ball and
                        you would attempt to roquet the ball so that it stops near to your current hoop - from there you
                        could play
                        your croquet stroke from a position that is already close to your hoop!
A rush that is not in a straight line is referred to as a "cut rush", whereby you aim at a point on the object ball that is off-centre.  In exactly the same concept as in snooker or pool, when the centre of your ball hits the spot on the object ball, the object ball will travel in a direction in line with that spot.

The key to being a good croquet player is to avoid having to play difficult shots very often.
                        Mastering the
                        rush is a key part of achieving this goal.

Hoop Shot
When running a hoop, the same principle applies as with making a roquet. It is particularly
                        important here to
                        observe a smooth follow-through, because this will enable the ball to be imparted with natural
                        forward-spin
                        so that the ball is rolling - not skidding - when it reaches the hoop. Any minor misjudgement of
                        direction
                        of the shot may be alleviated by the forward spin that has been imparted. Conversely it you were
                        to jab at
                        the ball with a quick stabbing motion, it would negate any natural forward spin and cause the
                        ball to skid
                        along the ground - this can result in the ball stopping and sticking in the hoop upon contact
                        with the
                        hoop upright.
When running hoops from an angle, the key thing to remember is that the ball must miss the "near wire"
                        (the hoop upright closest to the ball) in order to run the hoop. Even a light brush against the
                        near wire will result in a failed hoop



Running an angled hoop.  The shot on the left will fail because the centre of the ball is aimed at the centre of the gap.  The shot on the right will succeed because the edge of the ball is aimed to just miss the near upright of the hoop.


While it is true that topspin can help a ball run a hoop, you must avoid the temptation to apply additional topspin via hitting down on the ball - doing so is likely to lead to inaccuracy with direction and also loss of control, and should
                        be reserved for only extreme angles where running the hoop would otherwise be very doubtful.

Croquet strokes

Takeoff
While the takeoff is technically a croquet stroke, in reality it is played in the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke. The main purpose of the takeoff is to position the striker's ball for its continuation
                        stroke, and
                        leave the croqueted ball more-or-less where it is. When playing the takeoff, you must remember
                        that the
                        croqueted ball has to move, otherwise it will not be a valid croquet stroke and incur
                        end-of-turn.

Blue plays a "thick" takeoff from red
                                



You can play a takeoff from either side of the croqueted ball. The amount by which the croqueted
                        ball moves
                        is determined by the angle towards the object ball at which you hit - a small inward angle will
                        result in what is
                        called a "fine" or "thin" takeoff, whereby the croqueted ball just moves maybe an inch or two.
                        If you hit in towards
                        the croqueted ball more, then more momentum will be transferred into it, moving it more -
                        resulting in
                        what's known as a "thick takeoff".
Note also that some natural side-spin will be imparted on the striker's ball due to having been
                        in contact
                        with the croqueted ball. After the striker's ball is struck, and as it slows down, it will curve
                        inwards
                        slightly, in the same direction that which the croqueted ball had been on.

Stop Shot
The stop shot is a croquet stroke which causes the striker's ball to move the shortest
                        distance in
                        relation to the croqueted ball. This is achieved by hitting slightly underneath the
                        centreline of
                        your ball, countering the natural forward spin which would be imparted when playing a normal
                        stroke. The
                        mallet is grounded upon impacting the ball and there is no follow-through. Because the mallet head is angled upward (as shown in the image), the mallet handle is angled slightly further back than normal, so in order to play the stop shot comfortably, you should stand with your feet slightly further back than you would for a normal stroke.
                       





Note the upward angle of the mallet face

Depending on the lawn, balls and mallet weight, ratios of anywhere between 1:5 and 1:10 (and
                        sometimes even
                        higher) can be achieved with a stop shot. It is a good idea to practise and become very familiar
                        with your
                        stop shot ratio, as the easiest way to play a well-controlled break is through the use of
                        accurate stop
                        shots and drives.
Although playing a stop shot is easy, a good technique is required to achieve a good ratio. Essentially the only shot where a smooth strike is unhelpful, it can take a while to master the timing involved in grounding the mallet at the exact moment of impact with the ball.
As mentioned above, you should stand further back from the ball when playing a stop shot because the whole mallet is angled slightly back.  Placement of the feet on this shot varies - some player will take a half-step back with both
                        feet, whereas others will keep one foot in the normal position with the other further behind,
                        rocking onto the back foot to achieve the same result.
Back to top




Drive
The drive is the simplest croquet stroke to play, as it is played exactly the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke - with a normal stance and a normal follow through. Although the ratio will always vary
                        depending on
                        a number of factors (lawn, ball composition and mallet weight), the standard ratio achieved with
                        a drive is
                        about 1:3.



The drive is played like a single-ball stroke
                            


As with the stop shot, it is important to develop a consistent and repeatable drive ratio,
                        because these two
                        strokes are the basis of solid and controlled break play.
                    
Back to top




Half Roll
The half roll is played by hitting slightly downwards onto your ball - this imparts a small
                        amount of extra
                        forward spin compared to a drive, enabling a ratio of about 1:2. In order to play the stroke
                        comfortably,
                        you should stand further forward than for a normal stroke, with your feet (or at least your
                        front foot)
                        about level with the striker's ball. Because you are standing closer to the ball than normal on this shot, moving both your hands down the mallet somewhat will make the shot easier to play, as it will give more control over the mallet and also make the backswing easier.  



The mallet strikes blue at a downward angle
                                to impart
                                additional topspin, increasing the distance blue travels


The half roll can easily be played centre-style, however some players choose to play this stroke
                        side-style
                        in order to generate more power. 
Back to top




Full Roll
The full roll is a croquet stroke where both balls travel approximately the same distance. It is
                        often used
                        as a recovery stroke. In order to get the
                        striker's ball
                        to travel the same distance as the croqueted ball, a lot of forward spin is needed to be
                        imparted on the
                        striker's ball - to achieve this, your hands need to drop a lot further down the mallet than
                        normal, and
                        the mallet should impact the striker's ball at a steeper angle than for a half roll.



The mallet strikes blue at a steep angle,
                                imparting high
                                topspin and causing both balls to travel a similar distance.


The full roll is often played side-style in order to generate enough power in the stroke.
                        However, if the
                        player has good timing and technique, it is possible to play this stroke centre-style. 
Back to top




Pass Roll
The pass roll is similar to the full roll, but the striker's ball travels even further than the croqueted ball. In order to achieve this, even more forward spin is required - as a consequence, the hands need to drop even further down
                        the mallet
                        than for the full roll. The pass roll needs to be played with more punch than the full roll, meaning that the mallet head must still be in the process of accellerating at the moment it makes contact with the ball.  To help achieve this, you can shorten the backswing and apply additional force to the forward swing.  
                    



The mallet strikes blue at an acute angle,
                                creating
                                maximum topspin


Like the full roll, the pass roll is often played side-style in order to generate the power and "punch" required to apply such topspin.  Because of the steep downward angle of the mallet
                        required to generate the necessary forward spin means standing very far forward, playing this stroke
                        centre-style will
                        give a very restricted backswing.  The placement of the bottom hand should be very close to the mallet head, but beware that touching the mallet head during the stroke is a fault.

Split Shot
A split shot is not a croquet stroke in its own right, but rather a variation of the croquet
                        strokes listed above. It can apply to anything from a stop shot through to a pass roll, and
                        refers to playing a croquet stroke where both balls go in different directions.



Line of aim is halfway between the two
                                intended destination points


For a given croquet stroke, the player should line the two balls up in a line of where they wish
                        the object ball to be sent. After determining the intended destination point for the striker's ball, you must aim at a point halfway between the two. The croqueted ball will actually "pull" slightly in the direction which you are playing the stroke, so some allowance needs to be made for that when lining up the two balls.
The wider the angle of split, the less "roll" (topspin) is required to be applied to the striker's
                        ball to get it to travel a given distance - knowing the amount of roll to apply comes with practice.

Special Shots
There are various shots that crop up during a game which are needed to recover from particular situations, such as when you have run a hoop but have a hampered backswing - and deserve special mention.  

Jump Shot
The jump stroke is a single-ball stroke in which you hit downwards onto your ball, causing it to
                        jump into
                        the air. There are a number of reasons for doing this, such as jumping over a ball lodged in
                        your hoop after
                        a failed peel, or jumping over a hoop to try and hit another ball. Perhaps the most common
                        scenario for
                        playing a jump stroke is to try and run a very angled hoop (e.g. from over 40deg) - hitting down
                        onto your ball imparts extra forward spin, and
                        this can be useful to coax a ball through what would otherwise be considered an unrunnable hoop.
                    



By striking down on the the blue, it is rebounded into
                                the air with a lot of topspin


There are a number of ways to play the jump stroke, depending on how high, and how sharply, you
                        need your
                        ball to rise off the ground. In general, the more sharply you hit down onto your ball, the
                        steeper the jump
                        angle. If you played the stroke with a fairly shallow downward angle, then the ball would rise
                        more
                        gradually over a longer distance compared to playing the stroke with sharper and more pronounced
                        downward angle. 
When using a jump shot to run a hoop, the most important thing is to miss the near wire of the
                        hoop. The additional topspin imparted by the jump shot will deter the ball from rebounding when
                        it makes contact with the hoop upright, and instead will keep spinning forwards and (hopefully)
                        through the hoop.
Back to top




Sweep Shot
A sweep shot is used to get out of a hampered situation, normally after running a hoop and not having a clean swing at the reception ball.  It is played while kneeling on the court with the mallet held horizontally across the body, one hand near (but not touching) the mallet head and the other hand closer to the top of the handle.



Sweep shot after blue has run the hoop, hampered from red


The swing is in an arc shape, and is played in such a way that the hand closest to the mallet head will be moving forwards when the top hand is moving backwards, in a lever motion.  As a result, when the mallet face contacts the ball, it hits across the ball horizontally, imparting a small amount of side spin.  This in turn will help the ball curve slightly in the direction towards the intended target.  The line of aim should be at the outside edge of the target ball.
It is a shot worth practising both left-handed and right-handed, because either method may be required during a game, depending on the side of the hoop the mallet needs to swing.
There are a number of faults to look out for when playing a sweep shot, and some common ones include
                    
Touching the mallet head
Resting your arm on your leg
Resting a hand or arm on the ground
Hitting the ball with the corner of the mallet face


Back to top




Cannon
A cannon is a shot involving 3 (or occasionally 4) balls.  The most common cannon is the Corner 1 cannon, where three balls will all be in the corner, each ball in contact with one other ball.  
A common scenario where a cannon might arise is when the striker rushes a ball into the corner area when there is already a ball on the corner spot.  The roqueted ball is lined back onto the court, in contact with the existing corner ball, on either boundary.  At that point the existing corner ball can be moved to any position around the roqueted ball in contact with it.  As the striker made a roquet, they must take croquet from the roqueted ball.  The striker's ball must not be in contact with the existing corner ball.
If the striker's ball is for hoop 1, then the aim of the Corner 1 cannon would be to croquet a pioneer ball towards hoop 2, and in the same shot roquet the third ball, rushing it to hoop 1.  This may sound somewhat complicated, but once you break it down it is actually fairly simple.





Blue rushes black into the corner square.  Red is a corner ball.  Black is replaced on the yardline in contact with red.

Exact line of aim will need to be adjusted for the player's mallet characteristics - generally a heavier mallet which is better at rolls would aim somewhere near hoop 6 whereas a light mallet that is good for stop shots would aim nearer to hoop 5.  For most players, it would be somewhere between the two.  The stroke is normally played as a drive, but again could be slightly adjusted depending upon mallet characteristics.

Roquet
A roquet is the act of hitting your ball onto another ball.  A roquet can be made at any distance, be it the length of the court, or from just a few inches.  Most of what is written in the Technique section covers how to play with a technique that you would use to make a roquet.
To reiterate, it is important to develop a smooth, unhurried swing.  The best way to do this is to stand far enough back from the ball so that your swing is free and you can clearly see the aiming line.  Finding the aiming line is easier if you are able to see your own ball and also the target ball in your peripheral vision, and therefore when you have taken your stance, your head should not be any further forward than the back of the striker's ball.  Once the aiming has been completed, the only thought should then be on striking your own ball with the centre of the mallet, and keeping your head down throughout the strike.



A roquet should be hit with a smooth strike and the mallet should be flat upon impact with the ball


Remember to ensure that whatever technique you use, it should be the same for roquets of any distance.  A good practice routine for roqueting is to take two sets of balls, and place each set 4-5 yards apart.  Take 4 shots.  If you hit them all, then extend the range to 5 yards and repeat.  Keep extending the range by a yard each time.

Rush
Not exactly what the name implies, there is nothing hurried about a rush! A rush is simply a
                        roquet but from
                        short range - indeed, sometimes a rush is referred to as a "roquet-rush". What sets a rush apart
                        from a
                        normal roquet is that instead of just trying to hit the target ball (as with a roquet), the aim
                        of the rush
                        is to send the target ball to a specific spot or area so that the next shot (a croquet stroke) is
                        played from
                        as easy a place as possible. 



A short rush. Notice that the mallet is parallel to the
                                    ground at
                                    point of contact


An example of this might be when your ball is 1-foot away from
                        another ball and
                        you would attempt to roquet the ball so that it stops near to your current hoop - from there you
                        could play
                        your croquet stroke from a position that is already close to your hoop!
A rush that is not in a straight line is referred to as a "cut rush", whereby you aim at a point on the object ball that is off-centre.  In exactly the same concept as in snooker or pool, when the centre of your ball hits the spot on the object ball, the object ball will travel in a direction in line with that spot.



A cut rush to send red to a particular spot


The key to being a good croquet player is to avoid having to play difficult shots very often.
                        Mastering the
                        rush is a key part of achieving this goal.

Hoop Shot
When running a hoop, the same principle applies as with making a roquet. It is particularly
                        important here to
                        observe a smooth follow-through, because this will enable the ball to be imparted with natural
                        forward-spin
                        so that the ball is rolling - not skidding - when it reaches the hoop. Any minor misjudgement of
                        direction
                        of the shot may be alleviated by the forward spin that has been imparted. Conversely it you were
                        to jab at
                        the ball with a quick stabbing motion, it would negate any natural forward spin and cause the
                        ball to skid
                        along the ground - this can result in the ball stopping and sticking in the hoop upon contact
                        with the
                        hoop upright.
When running hoops from an angle, the key thing to remember is that the ball must miss the "near wire"
                        (the hoop upright closest to the ball) in order to run the hoop. Even a light brush against the
                        near wire will result in a failed hoop



Running an angled hoop.  The shot on the left will fail because the centre of the ball is aimed at the centre of the gap.  The shot on the right will succeed because the edge of the ball is aimed to just miss the near upright of the hoop.


While it is true that topspin can help a ball run a hoop, you must avoid the temptation to apply additional topspin via hitting down on the ball - doing so is likely to lead to inaccuracy with direction and also loss of control, and should
                        be reserved for only extreme angles where running the hoop would otherwise be very doubtful.

Croquet strokes

Takeoff
While the takeoff is technically a croquet stroke, in reality it is played in the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke. The main purpose of the takeoff is to position the striker's ball for its continuation
                        stroke, and
                        leave the croqueted ball more-or-less where it is. When playing the takeoff, you must remember
                        that the
                        croqueted ball has to move, otherwise it will not be a valid croquet stroke and incur
                        end-of-turn.

Blue plays a "thick" takeoff from red
                                



You can play a takeoff from either side of the croqueted ball. The amount by which the croqueted
                        ball moves
                        is determined by the angle towards the object ball at which you hit - a small inward angle will
                        result in what is
                        called a "fine" or "thin" takeoff, whereby the croqueted ball just moves maybe an inch or two.
                        If you hit in towards
                        the croqueted ball more, then more momentum will be transferred into it, moving it more -
                        resulting in
                        what's known as a "thick takeoff".
Note also that some natural side-spin will be imparted on the striker's ball due to having been
                        in contact
                        with the croqueted ball. After the striker's ball is struck, and as it slows down, it will curve
                        inwards
                        slightly, in the same direction that which the croqueted ball had been on.

Stop Shot
The stop shot is a croquet stroke which causes the striker's ball to move the shortest
                        distance in
                        relation to the croqueted ball. This is achieved by hitting slightly underneath the
                        centreline of
                        your ball, countering the natural forward spin which would be imparted when playing a normal
                        stroke. The
                        mallet is grounded upon impacting the ball and there is no follow-through. Because the mallet head is angled upward (as shown in the image), the mallet handle is angled slightly further back than normal, so in order to play the stop shot comfortably, you should stand with your feet slightly further back than you would for a normal stroke.
                       





Note the upward angle of the mallet face

Depending on the lawn, balls and mallet weight, ratios of anywhere between 1:5 and 1:10 (and
                        sometimes even
                        higher) can be achieved with a stop shot. It is a good idea to practise and become very familiar
                        with your
                        stop shot ratio, as the easiest way to play a well-controlled break is through the use of
                        accurate stop
                        shots and drives.
Although playing a stop shot is easy, a good technique is required to achieve a good ratio. Essentially the only shot where a smooth strike is unhelpful, it can take a while to master the timing involved in grounding the mallet at the exact moment of impact with the ball.
As mentioned above, you should stand further back from the ball when playing a stop shot because the whole mallet is angled slightly back.  Placement of the feet on this shot varies - some player will take a half-step back with both
                        feet, whereas others will keep one foot in the normal position with the other further behind,
                        rocking onto the back foot to achieve the same result.
Back to top




Drive
The drive is the simplest croquet stroke to play, as it is played exactly the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke - with a normal stance and a normal follow through. Although the ratio will always vary
                        depending on
                        a number of factors (lawn, ball composition and mallet weight), the standard ratio achieved with
                        a drive is
                        about 1:3.



The drive is played like a single-ball stroke
                            


As with the stop shot, it is important to develop a consistent and repeatable drive ratio,
                        because these two
                        strokes are the basis of solid and controlled break play.
                    
Back to top




Half Roll
The half roll is played by hitting slightly downwards onto your ball - this imparts a small
                        amount of extra
                        forward spin compared to a drive, enabling a ratio of about 1:2. In order to play the stroke
                        comfortably,
                        you should stand further forward than for a normal stroke, with your feet (or at least your
                        front foot)
                        about level with the striker's ball. Because you are standing closer to the ball than normal on this shot, moving both your hands down the mallet somewhat will make the shot easier to play, as it will give more control over the mallet and also make the backswing easier.  



The mallet strikes blue at a downward angle
                                to impart
                                additional topspin, increasing the distance blue travels


The half roll can easily be played centre-style, however some players choose to play this stroke
                        side-style
                        in order to generate more power. 
Back to top




Full Roll
The full roll is a croquet stroke where both balls travel approximately the same distance. It is
                        often used
                        as a recovery stroke. In order to get the
                        striker's ball
                        to travel the same distance as the croqueted ball, a lot of forward spin is needed to be
                        imparted on the
                        striker's ball - to achieve this, your hands need to drop a lot further down the mallet than
                        normal, and
                        the mallet should impact the striker's ball at a steeper angle than for a half roll.



The mallet strikes blue at a steep angle,
                                imparting high
                                topspin and causing both balls to travel a similar distance.


The full roll is often played side-style in order to generate enough power in the stroke.
                        However, if the
                        player has good timing and technique, it is possible to play this stroke centre-style. 
Back to top




Pass Roll
The pass roll is similar to the full roll, but the striker's ball travels even further than the croqueted ball. In order to achieve this, even more forward spin is required - as a consequence, the hands need to drop even further down
                        the mallet
                        than for the full roll. The pass roll needs to be played with more punch than the full roll, meaning that the mallet head must still be in the process of accellerating at the moment it makes contact with the ball.  To help achieve this, you can shorten the backswing and apply additional force to the forward swing.  
                    



The mallet strikes blue at an acute angle,
                                creating
                                maximum topspin


Like the full roll, the pass roll is often played side-style in order to generate the power and "punch" required to apply such topspin.  Because of the steep downward angle of the mallet
                        required to generate the necessary forward spin means standing very far forward, playing this stroke
                        centre-style will
                        give a very restricted backswing.  The placement of the bottom hand should be very close to the mallet head, but beware that touching the mallet head during the stroke is a fault.

Split Shot
A split shot is not a croquet stroke in its own right, but rather a variation of the croquet
                        strokes listed above. It can apply to anything from a stop shot through to a pass roll, and
                        refers to playing a croquet stroke where both balls go in different directions.



Line of aim is halfway between the two
                                intended destination points


For a given croquet stroke, the player should line the two balls up in a line of where they wish
                        the object ball to be sent. After determining the intended destination point for the striker's ball, you must aim at a point halfway between the two. The croqueted ball will actually "pull" slightly in the direction which you are playing the stroke, so some allowance needs to be made for that when lining up the two balls.
The wider the angle of split, the less "roll" (topspin) is required to be applied to the striker's
                        ball to get it to travel a given distance - knowing the amount of roll to apply comes with practice.

Special Shots
There are various shots that crop up during a game which are needed to recover from particular situations, such as when you have run a hoop but have a hampered backswing - and deserve special mention.  

Jump Shot
The jump stroke is a single-ball stroke in which you hit downwards onto your ball, causing it to
                        jump into
                        the air. There are a number of reasons for doing this, such as jumping over a ball lodged in
                        your hoop after
                        a failed peel, or jumping over a hoop to try and hit another ball. Perhaps the most common
                        scenario for
                        playing a jump stroke is to try and run a very angled hoop (e.g. from over 40deg) - hitting down
                        onto your ball imparts extra forward spin, and
                        this can be useful to coax a ball through what would otherwise be considered an unrunnable hoop.
                    



By striking down on the the blue, it is rebounded into
                                the air with a lot of topspin


There are a number of ways to play the jump stroke, depending on how high, and how sharply, you
                        need your
                        ball to rise off the ground. In general, the more sharply you hit down onto your ball, the
                        steeper the jump
                        angle. If you played the stroke with a fairly shallow downward angle, then the ball would rise
                        more
                        gradually over a longer distance compared to playing the stroke with sharper and more pronounced
                        downward angle. 
When using a jump shot to run a hoop, the most important thing is to miss the near wire of the
                        hoop. The additional topspin imparted by the jump shot will deter the ball from rebounding when
                        it makes contact with the hoop upright, and instead will keep spinning forwards and (hopefully)
                        through the hoop.
Back to top




Sweep Shot
A sweep shot is used to get out of a hampered situation, normally after running a hoop and not having a clean swing at the reception ball.  It is played while kneeling on the court with the mallet held horizontally across the body, one hand near (but not touching) the mallet head and the other hand closer to the top of the handle.



Sweep shot after blue has run the hoop, hampered from red


The swing is in an arc shape, and is played in such a way that the hand closest to the mallet head will be moving forwards when the top hand is moving backwards, in a lever motion.  As a result, when the mallet face contacts the ball, it hits across the ball horizontally, imparting a small amount of side spin.  This in turn will help the ball curve slightly in the direction towards the intended target.  The line of aim should be at the outside edge of the target ball.
It is a shot worth practising both left-handed and right-handed, because either method may be required during a game, depending on the side of the hoop the mallet needs to swing.
There are a number of faults to look out for when playing a sweep shot, and some common ones include
                    
Touching the mallet head
Resting your arm on your leg
Resting a hand or arm on the ground
Hitting the ball with the corner of the mallet face


Back to top




Cannon
A cannon is a shot involving 3 (or occasionally 4) balls.  The most common cannon is the Corner 1 cannon, where three balls will all be in the corner, each ball in contact with one other ball.  
A common scenario where a cannon might arise is when the striker rushes a ball into the corner area when there is already a ball on the corner spot.  The roqueted ball is lined back onto the court, in contact with the existing corner ball, on either boundary.  At that point the existing corner ball can be moved to any position around the roqueted ball in contact with it.  As the striker made a roquet, they must take croquet from the roqueted ball.  The striker's ball must not be in contact with the existing corner ball.
If the striker's ball is for hoop 1, then the aim of the Corner 1 cannon would be to croquet a pioneer ball towards hoop 2, and in the same shot roquet the third ball, rushing it to hoop 1.  This may sound somewhat complicated, but once you break it down it is actually fairly simple.





Blue rushes black into the corner square.  Red is a corner ball.  Black is replaced on the yardline in contact with red.

Exact line of aim will need to be adjusted for the player's mallet characteristics - generally a heavier mallet which is better at rolls would aim somewhere near hoop 6 whereas a light mallet that is good for stop shots would aim nearer to hoop 5.  For most players, it would be somewhere between the two.  The stroke is normally played as a drive, but again could be slightly adjusted depending upon mallet characteristics.

Shots
To borrow from John Prince's croquet video, "A famous player once remarked that hitting one's own
                        ball
                        correctly was the only difficult thing in croquet". 
Below you will find an overview of the shots involved in croquet, and some high-level guidance on how
                    to achieve them. More detailed information on specific strokes may also be found in the Technique section
If you have read the introduction section, or are already somewhat familiar with croquet, then you
                    will
                    realise that there are two basic types of stroke involved - single ball strokes and croquet
                    strokes.

Single-ball strokes

Roquet
A roquet is the act of hitting your ball onto another ball.  A roquet can be made at any distance, be it the length of the court, or from just a few inches.  Most of what is written in the Technique section covers how to play with a technique that you would use to make a roquet.
To reiterate, it is important to develop a smooth, unhurried swing.  The best way to do this is to stand far enough back from the ball so that your swing is free and you can clearly see the aiming line.  Finding the aiming line is easier if you are able to see your own ball and also the target ball in your peripheral vision, and therefore when you have taken your stance, your head should not be any further forward than the back of the striker's ball.  Once the aiming has been completed, the only thought should then be on striking your own ball with the centre of the mallet, and keeping your head down throughout the strike.



A roquet should be hit with a smooth strike and the mallet should be flat upon impact with the ball


Remember to ensure that whatever technique you use, it should be the same for roquets of any distance.  A good practice routine for roqueting is to take two sets of balls, and place each set 4-5 yards apart.  Take 4 shots.  If you hit them all, then extend the range to 5 yards and repeat.  Keep extending the range by a yard each time.

Rush
Not exactly what the name implies, there is nothing hurried about a rush! A rush is simply a
                        roquet but from
                        short range - indeed, sometimes a rush is referred to as a "roquet-rush". What sets a rush apart
                        from a
                        normal roquet is that instead of just trying to hit the target ball (as with a roquet), the aim
                        of the rush
                        is to send the target ball to a specific spot or area so that the next shot (a croquet stroke) is
                        played from
                        as easy a place as possible. 



A short rush. Notice that the mallet is parallel to the
                                    ground at
                                    point of contact


An example of this might be when your ball is 1-foot away from
                        another ball and
                        you would attempt to roquet the ball so that it stops near to your current hoop - from there you
                        could play
                        your croquet stroke from a position that is already close to your hoop!
A rush that is not in a straight line is referred to as a "cut rush", whereby you aim at a point on the object ball that is off-centre.  In exactly the same concept as in snooker or pool, when the centre of your ball hits the spot on the object ball, the object ball will travel in a direction in line with that spot.



A cut rush to send red to a particular spot


The key to being a good croquet player is to avoid having to play difficult shots very often.
                        Mastering the
                        rush is a key part of achieving this goal.

Hoop Shot
When running a hoop, the same principle applies as with making a roquet. It is particularly
                        important here to
                        observe a smooth follow-through, because this will enable the ball to be imparted with natural
                        forward-spin
                        so that the ball is rolling - not skidding - when it reaches the hoop. Any minor misjudgement of
                        direction
                        of the shot may be alleviated by the forward spin that has been imparted. Conversely it you were
                        to jab at
                        the ball with a quick stabbing motion, it would negate any natural forward spin and cause the
                        ball to skid
                        along the ground - this can result in the ball stopping and sticking in the hoop upon contact
                        with the
                        hoop upright.
When running hoops from an angle, the key thing to remember is that the ball must miss the "near wire"
                        (the hoop upright closest to the ball) in order to run the hoop. Even a light brush against the
                        near wire will result in a failed hoop



Running an angled hoop.  The shot on the left will fail because the centre of the ball is aimed at the centre of the gap.  The shot on the right will succeed because the edge of the ball is aimed to just miss the near upright of the hoop.


While it is true that topspin can help a ball run a hoop, you must avoid the temptation to apply additional topspin via hitting down on the ball - doing so is likely to lead to inaccuracy with direction and also loss of control, and should
                        be reserved for only extreme angles where running the hoop would otherwise be very doubtful.

Croquet strokes

Takeoff
While the takeoff is technically a croquet stroke, in reality it is played in the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke. The main purpose of the takeoff is to position the striker's ball for its continuation
                        stroke, and
                        leave the croqueted ball more-or-less where it is. When playing the takeoff, you must remember
                        that the
                        croqueted ball has to move, otherwise it will not be a valid croquet stroke and incur
                        end-of-turn.

Blue plays a "thick" takeoff from red
                                



You can play a takeoff from either side of the croqueted ball. The amount by which the croqueted
                        ball moves
                        is determined by the angle towards the object ball at which you hit - a small inward angle will
                        result in what is
                        called a "fine" or "thin" takeoff, whereby the croqueted ball just moves maybe an inch or two.
                        If you hit in towards
                        the croqueted ball more, then more momentum will be transferred into it, moving it more -
                        resulting in
                        what's known as a "thick takeoff".
Note also that some natural side-spin will be imparted on the striker's ball due to having been
                        in contact
                        with the croqueted ball. After the striker's ball is struck, and as it slows down, it will curve
                        inwards
                        slightly, in the same direction that which the croqueted ball had been on.

Stop Shot
The stop shot is a croquet stroke which causes the striker's ball to move the shortest
                        distance in
                        relation to the croqueted ball. This is achieved by hitting slightly underneath the
                        centreline of
                        your ball, countering the natural forward spin which would be imparted when playing a normal
                        stroke. The
                        mallet is grounded upon impacting the ball and there is no follow-through. Because the mallet head is angled upward (as shown in the image), the mallet handle is angled slightly further back than normal, so in order to play the stop shot comfortably, you should stand with your feet slightly further back than you would for a normal stroke.
                       





Note the upward angle of the mallet face

Depending on the lawn, balls and mallet weight, ratios of anywhere between 1:5 and 1:10 (and
                        sometimes even
                        higher) can be achieved with a stop shot. It is a good idea to practise and become very familiar
                        with your
                        stop shot ratio, as the easiest way to play a well-controlled break is through the use of
                        accurate stop
                        shots and drives.
Although playing a stop shot is easy, a good technique is required to achieve a good ratio. Essentially the only shot where a smooth strike is unhelpful, it can take a while to master the timing involved in grounding the mallet at the exact moment of impact with the ball.
As mentioned above, you should stand further back from the ball when playing a stop shot because the whole mallet is angled slightly back.  Placement of the feet on this shot varies - some player will take a half-step back with both
                        feet, whereas others will keep one foot in the normal position with the other further behind,
                        rocking onto the back foot to achieve the same result.
Back to top




Drive
The drive is the simplest croquet stroke to play, as it is played exactly the same way as a
                        single-ball
                        stroke - with a normal stance and a normal follow through. Although the ratio will always vary
                        depending on
                        a number of factors (lawn, ball composition and mallet weight), the standard ratio achieved with
                        a drive is
                        about 1:3.



The drive is played like a single-ball stroke
                            


As with the stop shot, it is important to develop a consistent and repeatable drive ratio,
                        because these two
                        strokes are the basis of solid and controlled break play.

Half Roll
The half roll is played by hitting slightly downwards onto your ball - this imparts a small
                        amount of extra
                        forward spin compared to a drive, enabling a ratio of about 1:2. In order to play the stroke
                        comfortably,
                        you should stand further forward than for a normal stroke, with your feet (or at least your
                        front foot)
                        about level with the striker's ball. Because you are standing closer to the ball than normal on this shot, moving both your hands down the mallet somewhat will make the shot easier to play, as it will give more control over the mallet and also make the backswing easier.  



The mallet strikes blue at a downward angle
                                to impart
                                additional topspin, increasing the distance blue travels


The half roll can easily be played centre-style, however some players choose to play this stroke
                        side-style
                        in order to generate more power. 
Back to top




Full Roll
The full roll is a croquet stroke where both balls travel approximately the same distance. It is
                        often used
                        as a recovery stroke. In order to get the
                        striker's ball
                        to travel the same distance as the croqueted ball, a lot of forward spin is needed to be
                        imparted on the
                        striker's ball - to achieve this, your hands need to drop a lot further down the mallet than
                        normal, and
                        the mallet should impact the striker's ball at a steeper angle than for a half roll.



The mallet strikes blue at a steep angle,
                                imparting high
                                topspin and causing both balls to travel a similar distance.


The full roll is often played side-style in order to generate enough power in the stroke.
                        However, if the
                        player has good timing and technique, it is possible to play this stroke centre-style. 
Back to top




Pass Roll
The pass roll is similar to the full roll, but the striker's ball travels even further than the croqueted ball. In order to achieve this, even more forward spin is required - as a consequence, the hands need to drop even further down
                        the mallet
                        than for the full roll. The pass roll needs to be played with more punch than the full roll, meaning that the mallet head must still be in the process of accellerating at the moment it makes contact with the ball.  To help achieve this, you can shorten the backswing and apply additional force to the forward swing.  
                    



The mallet strikes blue at an acute angle,
                                creating
                                maximum topspin


Like the full roll, the pass roll is often played side-style in order to generate the power and "punch" required to apply such topspin.  Because of the steep downward angle of the mallet
                        required to generate the necessary forward spin means standing very far forward, playing this stroke
                        centre-style will
                        give a very restricted backswing.  The placement of the bottom hand should be very close to the mallet head, but beware that touching the mallet head during the stroke is a fault.

Split Shot
A split shot is not a croquet stroke in its own right, but rather a variation of the croquet
                        strokes listed above. It can apply to anything from a stop shot through to a pass roll, and
                        refers to playing a croquet stroke where both balls go in different directions.



Line of aim is halfway between the two
                                intended destination points


For a given croquet stroke, the player should line the two balls up in a line of where they wish
                        the object ball to be sent. After determining the intended destination point for the striker's ball, you must aim at a point halfway between the two. The croqueted ball will actually "pull" slightly in the direction which you are playing the stroke, so some allowance needs to be made for that when lining up the two balls.
The wider the angle of split, the less "roll" (topspin) is required to be applied to the striker's
                        ball to get it to travel a given distance - knowing the amount of roll to apply comes with practice.

Special Shots
There are various shots that crop up during a game which are needed to recover from particular situations, such as when you have run a hoop but have a hampered backswing - and deserve special mention.  

Jump Shot
The jump stroke is a single-ball stroke in which you hit downwards onto your ball, causing it to
                        jump into
                        the air. There are a number of reasons for doing this, such as jumping over a ball lodged in
                        your hoop after
                        a failed peel, or jumping over a hoop to try and hit another ball. Perhaps the most common
                        scenario for
                        playing a jump stroke is to try and run a very angled hoop (e.g. from over 40deg) - hitting down
                        onto your ball imparts extra forward spin, and
                        this can be useful to coax a ball through what would otherwise be considered an unrunnable hoop.
                    



By striking down on the the blue, it is rebounded into
                                the air with a lot of topspin


There are a number of ways to play the jump stroke, depending on how high, and how sharply, you
                        need your
                        ball to rise off the ground. In general, the more sharply you hit down onto your ball, the
                        steeper the jump
                        angle. If you played the stroke with a fairly shallow downward angle, then the ball would rise
                        more
                        gradually over a longer distance compared to playing the stroke with sharper and more pronounced
                        downward angle. 
When using a jump shot to run a hoop, the most important thing is to miss the near wire of the
                        hoop. The additional topspin imparted by the jump shot will deter the ball from rebounding when
                        it makes contact with the hoop upright, and instead will keep spinning forwards and (hopefully)
                        through the hoop.
Back to top




Sweep Shot
A sweep shot is used to get out of a hampered situation, normally after running a hoop and not having a clean swing at the reception ball.  It is played while kneeling on the court with the mallet held horizontally across the body, one hand near (but not touching) the mallet head and the other hand closer to the top of the handle.



Sweep shot after blue has run the hoop, hampered from red


The swing is in an arc shape, and is played in such a way that the hand closest to the mallet head will be moving forwards when the top hand is moving backwards, in a lever motion.  As a result, when the mallet face contacts the ball, it hits across the ball horizontally, imparting a small amount of side spin.  This in turn will help the ball curve slightly in the direction towards the intended target.  The line of aim should be at the outside edge of the target ball.
It is a shot worth practising both left-handed and right-handed, because either method may be required during a game, depending on the side of the hoop the mallet needs to swing.
There are a number of faults to look out for when playing a sweep shot, and some common ones include
                    
Touching the mallet head
Resting your arm on your leg
Resting a hand or arm on the ground
Hitting the ball with the corner of the mallet face


Back to top




Cannon
A cannon is a shot involving 3 (or occasionally 4) balls.  The most common cannon is the Corner 1 cannon, where three balls will all be in the corner, each ball in contact with one other ball.  
A common scenario where a cannon might arise is when the striker rushes a ball into the corner area when there is already a ball on the corner spot.  The roqueted ball is lined back onto the court, in contact with the existing corner ball, on either boundary.  At that point the existing corner ball can be moved to any position around the roqueted ball in contact with it.  As the striker made a roquet, they must take croquet from the roqueted ball.  The striker's ball must not be in contact with the existing corner ball.
If the striker's ball is for hoop 1, then the aim of the Corner 1 cannon would be to croquet a pioneer ball towards hoop 2, and in the same shot roquet the third ball, rushing it to hoop 1.  This may sound somewhat complicated, but once you break it down it is actually fairly simple.

Exact line of aim will need to be adjusted for the player's mallet characteristics - generally a heavier mallet which is better at rolls would aim somewhere near hoop 6 whereas a light mallet that is good for stop shots would aim nearer to hoop 5.  For most players, it would be somewhere between the two.  The stroke is normally played as a drive, but again could be slightly adjusted depending upon mallet characteristics.

Breaks


Breaks

            Breaks are the building blocks of effective croquet.  Playing a break - which refers to scoring multiple points in a single turn - is the most efficient way to win, and most turns that you play will involve some sort of attempt at establishing one.    For each additional ball involved in a break, it makes playing the break exponentially easier.  
        
To assist in  understanding break concepts, it's firstly important to understand some terminology
        

Striker's ball - this is the ball that you strike with the mallet, which you will use for the duration of your turn
Pilot ball - this is a ball that is near to your current hoop that you take croquet from immediately before scoring your hoop
                
Reception ball - this is the ball that you roquet AFTER scoring your hoop - generally the pilot ball automatically becomes the reception ball after the hoop is scored.  
Pioneer ball - this is a ball that has been placed near to your next hoop (current hoop + 1) and will automatically become your pilot ball when it comes to making that hoop.  Well-placed pioneer balls are key to controlled breaks because an accurate pioneer will mean you are approaching your hoops from a close position.
                
Pivot ball - this is a ball which is placed near the middle of the court, which you can utilise to reduce the distance your strikerâ€™s ball must travel in any one shot - you can think of this as a ball that is placed halfway between where you are and where you intend to get to between making any two hoops.  A well-placed pivot ball will mean your break never has to involve difficult croquet strokes.
                

Before we look at the different types of break, it is first important to cover one key aspect that makes all breaks easier to play - that is, running hoops with control.
Hoop control
Running hoops under control, i.e. running a hoop to a specific point on the lawn to allow a rush in an advantageous direction, is the single biggest factor in playing controlled breaks.  By running hoops with control, it means that you will essentially be able to choose where on the lawn you want to play your croquet strokes from.  To run hoops with control requires 2 things:

Giving yourself short, straight hoop shots
Trusting your technique

In order to ensure that you are running short, straight hoops instead of long, angled hoops, your pioneer balls must be placed accurately; on the other hand, in order to place your pioneer balls accurately you must run your hoops with good control.  This may seem to you like a Catch 22-type scenario, and you would be right; but we must start somewhere, and so my advice is to first learn how to run short, straight hoops with good control, and then work backwards from there. 
If you are practising running short, straight hoops but still are lacking control, then it is likely due to an issue with your technique.  As discussed in the Technique section, you should strike the ball with a smooth, unhurried swing in order to achieve the best result.  It is especially true for hoop running where the margins for error are small.  A smooth, unhurried strike of a ball can often make up for a small misjudgement in aiming - this is because a smooth strike will impart natural topspin onto the ball which can help to run a hoop which otherwise may fail.  
Let us now move on to breaks...

2 ball break
This consists only of the striker's ball and the pilot/reception ball and is, by far, the hardest break to play.  Even very strong players struggle to make more than a few hoops in a turn when playing a 2-ball break



Click anywhere on the animation above to see an example 2-ball break through the first 6 hoops


As you can see, this break is very difficult to play as it allows almost no room for error.  Every rush has to be played accurately, and every hoop shot must be well controlled to keep gaining a rush on the reception ball in the direction of your next hoop.  Whenever presented with a 2-ball break you should look to convert it to a 3-ball or 4-ball break at the earliest opportunity.  

3 ball break
This consists of the striker's ball, a pilot/reception ball and a pioneer ball.  Significantly easier to play than the 2-ball break because of the addition of a third ball, which can be used as a pioneer at your current hoop + 1.
Good players may be able to play a 3-ball break through all the hoops in one turn.  Playing this break still requires a good amount of control to play well, as running hoops with control will avoid having to play difficult croquet strokes.  It is very easy for a well-controlled 3-ball break to spiral out of control quickly due to one poor croquet stroke.

In the example animation above, blue roquets black and croquets it towards H2 as a pioneer while approaching the yellow pilot ball at H1.  
After hoop 1 is scored, blue rushes yellow up the court and then croquets it to hoop 3 as a pioneer, approaching the black pilot ball at hoop 2 with blue.  After roqueting black, approaching and then scoring hoop 2, black will preferably be rushed slightly north-east and croqueted to hoop 4 as the pioneer, while approaching the yellow pilot ball at hoop 3.  You can probably see a pattern starting to emerge here - after scoring your hoop, you roquet the reception ball, croquet it to your current hoop + 1 and then roquet your pilot ball (which was previously your pioneer) and score your current hoop.  This pattern is repeated across all 12 hoops.  The best players will ensure they run the hoops under control to obtain rushes in an advantageous direction, and then play those rushes to a spot that makes their croquet stroke easier.
Pioneer position
The court is a rectangle in shape.  The four outside hoops also form a rectangle and in order to keep your break easily under control, it is advisable to keep all the pioneers within this inner rectangle.  If a ball is sent a few yards past the invisible line formed by the inner rectangle, then later in the turn a good croquet stroke will need to be played in order to gain a rush on that ball back to good position in front of a given hoop - if no rush is obtained then it will result in a long and speculative hoop approach and will often result in a failed hoop and a failed break.  
1-back pioneer south of 1-back
With most pioneers in a 3-ball break, you should be aiming to send them as close as possible (without going too far past) the hoops - this is because a close pioneer is a good pioneer, and even if you donâ€™t get a rush out of your current hoop in the direction of the next hoop, a croquet stroke of some kind is still possible, to send out a pioneer while approaching the pilot at the next hoop.  However one exception to this is with the 1-back pioneer - in the example below, a 1-back pioneer has been sent close to the hoop and hoop 6 has just been scored with no rush - now you are in a difficult position of being unable to send out a 2-back pioneer while maintaining close position on the 1-back pilot.



If blue does not achieve a forward rush from H6, then having the 1-back pioneer south of the hoop (spot #2) means a pioneer can more easily be sent to 2-back.


There are two mitigations that can be used to try and avoid this situation - if your pioneer at 1-back is close to the hoop, then you can attempt to get an easterly rush out of hoop 6 so that your croquet stroke loading 2-back can be played from a position that gives enough room to get both balls near enough to their ideal positions.  Alternatively you can attempt to send the 1-back pioneer south of the hoop in the first place - about 4-5 feet south is good - so that if you do not get a rush out of hoop 6 you are still able to play a croquet stroke loading 2-back and approaching the 1-back pilot from a position that is close-by.  

4 ball break
This consists of the striker's ball, the pilot/reception ball, pioneer ball and pivot ball - by far the easiest break to play due to the addition of a fourth ball, meaning your break can have both a pioneer ball and a pivot ball.
Everyone should strive to have all 4 balls available in the break as soon as safely possible.  Having all four balls available to the break means that no difficult strokes need ever be played.  Running hoops with control can help, but the consequences for not doing so are far less severe with the 4-ball break due to the pivot ball always being in an easily-accessible position near the mid-court.  It is also possible to recover a break after a poor croquet stroke by temporarily repurposing the pivot ball as a pioneer if necessary.

The above animation shows a 4-ball break where yellow is used as the pivot ball throughout the break.   
4-ball break variations
As you become more familiar and competent of the repeating pattern involved in breaks, you will realise that in order to play a 4-ball break well requires no particularly difficult strokes at all.  Having a fourth ball available in the break is a great luxury, meaning that you can deviate from the usual pattern if and when the need arises.  The key shots that determine the success of your break are likely to be the accuracy of your croquet strokes to send out pioneers.  A good pioneer at your next hoop means you need only get close enough to roquet it and you will be guaranteed to be approaching your hoop from a short distance away.  With this in mind there are a few tricks or shortcuts that can be considered when playing a 4-ball break that can ultimately make your break easier. 
Backup pioneers
Looking at a 3-ball break compared to a 4-ball break, you will see that there is relatively little margin for error when sending out your pioneers.  If you play a bad croquet stroke and the pioneer goes 5-yards too far or too short of your intended destination, then you are required to start playing a series of good strokes to get the break back under control, and run the serious risk of breaking down.  With the addition of a fourth ball (i.e. a 4-ball break), your croquet strokes to send out the pioneers in the first place are usually significantly easier because they will usually be played as stop shots or drives (the easiest types of croquet stroke), and you don't need to be nearly as accurate with your placement of the striker's ball when approaching the pivot ball.  However, it is of course still common to play a poor croquet stroke and end up with a pioneer that is poorly placed.  Because you have a fourth ball available, you can redeploy the pivot ball temporarily as a second (and hopefully better) pioneer.  Let's look at an example of this where blue is just running H1 with a perfect break laid out, and sends the reception ball as a bad pioneer to H3:



Click anywhere on the animation above to see an example of sending a backup pioneer during a 4-ball break


As you can see, blue sent the H3 pioneer (black) much too far, ending closer to C3 than H3.  But after playing the bad shot and reassessing the court situation, blue roquets the pivot (red) and sends that also to H3 while approaching the ball waiting near H2.  After making H2, blue croquets a pioneer to H4 while approaching the poorly-placed (original) H3 pioneer and then redeploys that to the centre of the court as the new pivot ball.  After blue ran H2, it may also have legitimately chosen instead to send the H2 reception ball as the new pivot while approaching the black near C3 and then sending black to H4 as the pioneer. With 4 balls on the lawn, there a various ways and opportunities to swap them around if needed. 
Early 2-back pioneer
The early 2-back pioneer is a pioneer sent to 2-back after making H5.  This is the most common "shortcut", and is part of most good players' standard 4-ball break.  This diverges from the normal play that you might expect of running H5 and then roqueting the reception ball and croqueting it towards 1-back.  The reason for the popularity of the early 2-back pioneer is because H5 is in such close proximity to 2-back and it is much easier to have an accurate pioneer at 2-back if you are sending it there from somewhere near H5 than if you had to send it there from somewhere near H6 (as would be the case following a standard 4-ball break pattern).  Another good reason is due to the relative closeness of your next 2 hoops - H6 and 1-back - these hoops are both fairly close to H5 and to one another, and so the prospect of leaving a ball "behind" at 2-back after H5 and continuing without a pivot ball for the next 2 hoops is less risky, given the relatively small distances involved.



Click to play animation.  Blue has just run H4 and is taking croquet from yellow.  Yellow will be sent to H6 (off screen) as a pioneer


In the animation, as you can see, before running H5, blue ensures that the pivot ball (red) is placed somewhere slightly north-west of H5 instead of near the peg, and when blue runs H5 and roquets black (its partner ball), it croquets black to 2-back at this point, gaining a rush on the pivot up the court.  As you can see, by using this method, blue has avoided two large croquet strokes (sending pioneer to 1-back from near H5 and sending pioneer to 2-back from near H6) and instead replaces them with much smaller and easier strokes.
Having stated the merits of an early 2-back pioneer, it is not always the best approach.  You should always be reassessing the best percentage plays throughout your break, and if for example your H6 pioneer is poor - if it is closer to the peg than H6, or is north of H6 - then it is probably a better idea to carry on with the normal break pattern instead of having an early 2-back pioneer.  No matter how good your 2-back pioneer is, you won't make 2-back if you don't make H6! Other things to consider are the court conditions - if the court is fast, you may not want to have an early pioneer because it will have the effect of removing a ball from your immediate break.  If the ground is particularly fast or uneven around H6 or 1-back and you have left a ball "behind" at 2-back already, then you have no option to send a backup pioneer to 1-back if the first one is not very good.  A rule of thumb is that if your break is at all uncertain, keep all the balls immediately accessible to your break.
Early hoop 6 pioneer
It is also quite possible to have an early H6 pioneer for the same reasons outlined above for the early 2-back pioneer.  If your break is under control before making H3, and you have a good pioneer at H4, then you can consider making H3 and croqueting the reception ball to H6 while gaining a rush on the pivot down the court.  The same basis for having an early 2-back pioneer holds true in this case - a series of smaller strokes which can result in more accurate pioneers.  However the benefits of the early H6 pioneer are smaller than for the early 2-back pioneer - if your break is under control, my advice is to send the H3 reception ball to H5 as a pioneer as per the standard pattern, unless there is a compelling reason to have a particular ball as a pioneer at H6.

Establishing a break
Everything so far has talked about a break that is either already in progress, or perfectly laid out.  However in a real game, you will hardly ever start a break from such a simple position.  Learning how to read the ball positions and dig out a break is a very important part of playing croquet successfully.  In most cases, if possible, you should be looking to load a pioneer to your next hoop before, or while, gaining a rush to your current hoop.
Getting a pioneer before you make your first hoop
While sometimes this is just not possible, if you have a choice between a long rush straight to your hoop or a long rush to another ball, it is often a better idea to rush to the other ball.  Granted, this is something of a generalisation, but let's look at an example of this below, where blue has a straight rush to H1 on black, with yellow south of the peg, and slightly in-lawn from the west boundary.  Red is of no use as it is in C4.

In the animation you can see that, while blue does have a rush pointing at H1, it has chosen instead to play a cut rush on black, towards the yellow ball.  By doing so, it not only benefits from having a good pioneer at H2 before H1 is scored, but also can end up playing the rush to H1 on yellow, which in itself is closer to H1 than black was at the start of the turn, and hence should be a shorter and easier rush.
Making your hoop without a pioneer
Realistically, you will frequently be presented with scenarios where, at the start of your turn, you have a dolly rush on partner to your hoop, but there are no pioneers or particularly useful balls elsewhere on the court.  In these circumstances it's often best to make your current hoop without setting out a pioneer first, but before you play any shots at all, you should already be planning on how you will go about establishing your break.  Have a look at the below scenario and think about what blue might do.  After making H1, blue needs to make H2, so it should look for ways to establish a pioneer at H3 and get a rush to H2.

Establish a break after making your hoop

Ã—

Note in the solution that blue takes its dolly rush to H1, and deliberately plays to obtain a rush on black to a spot south-east of red after scoring the hoop.  Rushing to that spot enables black to be croqueted as a pioneer to H3 while gaining a rush on red to yellow.  At the start of the turn, blue identified that yellow was, by far, the closest ball to H2, and so it was careful to try and convert yellow into its H2 pilot ball. In order to do so, blue made sure to try and gather the most distant ball (red) into the break as quickly as possible.
Consider, instead, if when blue croqueted black to H3, it chose to try and obtain a rush on red towards H2 - the fundamental flaws inherent in that line of play are that: 
    
Rushing red to H2 is more than twice the distance compared with rushing yellow to H2
Rushing red to H2 does nothing to develop yellow, and even if blue is successful in the rush, it only has a 3-ball break


Now consider if, instead, blue scored H1 and then rushed black close to yellow.  Blue will probably succeed in getting a good rush to H2, however the flaws in this line of play are that:

  
There will be no H3 pioneer
Because of no H3 pioneer, blue will have to run H2 with complete control to obtain a rush back towards black or red, and then play yet another good rush to H3


Shooting at the back ball
A frequently-mentioned best practice in croquet is to "always shoot at the back ball".  What this means is, if the opponent balls are together, with one ball on the yardline and the other slightly in court, then when you hit-in and take off to their balls, in most cases you should roquet the yardline ball first, even if it is a slightly longer roquet for you.  The reason for this is that you will no doubt be wanting a rush somewhere into the court, and so by roqueting the ball that is closer to the yardline first, you will be taking croquet from a spot that is  closer to spot you want to play the next rush from.  You also have more room to croquet a ball into the court than you would have if you had roqueted the in-lawn ball first, which will assist in your attempted break.  In the example below, blue has just hit in with a long roquet on black, and takes off to the opponent balls near C2.  Blue is sure to roquet the back ball (yellow) first, both to aid in getting a good rush to H1 and to have a better pioneer at H2.

Committing partner ball as a pivot (or not)
If your attempted break pickup involves lots of long rushes, you may want to be more conservative about where you put the balls, just in case you do not end up getting a hoop-running position at your hoop. Take the following example where blue (for H1) is going to have to play a very long rush towards hoop 1 in order to have a break in this turn.  Rushing to your hoop from such a distance is no guarantee of a good hoop position at all, and so you may rightly conclude that you don't want to put partner ball in the middle of the court, and instead leave it close to a boundary to go back "home" to just in case.  



Blue will have to rush a ball a long distance in order to make H1 so may choose not to commit partner to the middle of the court


Launch the solution




Choosing whether to commit partner to the middle of the court

Ã—






                Click on the court to play the animation.  Blue is for H1



Close





As you can see in the animation, after initially rushing black behind yellow, blue chooses to take off and get a good rush on yellow towards red, deliberately leaving black close to the east boundary.  It could have instead chosen to play a stop shot to put black towards the middle of the court.  This would have been optimal if blue was confident of making its hoop in this turn - for example if blue was for H2 and had a handy ball (red) close-by to its hoop.
As it turned out, when blue failed to gain hoop running position at H1 a few strokes later, it was able to retreat back to black again with its final shot, and retain the innings.  If black had been in the middle of the court, the only way for blue to join black again would be to lag blue near to it, mid-court.  This not only greatly shortens red or yellow's attempted roquet at blue and black, meaning that the opponent is more likely to hit, but it also makes red and yellow's shot safer and makes blue & black's break pickup much more difficult - a miss from red or yellow through blue & black in mid-court would finish on a distant boundary far from blue & black, and consequently make blue's next break pickup all the more difficult with one fewer ball at its disposal.  When picking up a break, you should always be assessing your chances of success - as seen in the example, sometimes there is a place for caution.

            Openings
          


Openings

        The opening is the battle between the two sides to be the first to gain
        the upper hand. Generally when we talk about openings in croquet, we are
        referring to the first 4 turns. At the very top level it is where games
        are won and lost, but at all levels it provides a fascinating array of
        options for bluffing and double-bluffing your opponent.
      
Opening priorities
As the stronger player

        The stronger player who is playing a dangerous but less experienced /
        weaker player will generally approach the opening with the intent of not
        giving away an easy break, and hence a more defensive mindset. Openings
        where there is a lot of grey area, balls on boundaries and in corners
        are best for this. The stronger player will generally rely on their
        better all-round game in order to win, and is more comfortable with
        digging balls out slowly into a break.
      
As the weaker player

        The weaker player should approach a game against a much stronger
        opponent with an attacking mindset - they will not be afraid to take on
        relatively short shots that give laid breaks, even if it means conceding
        a laid break if they miss. The weaker player should favour openings that
        have balls in-lawn and should be looking to put pressure on the stronger
        player to have to hit in.
      
Evenly-matched players

        It is quite common to see very aggressive, black and white, openings
        when two very strong players play against each other. The same is true
        for openings between evenly-matched players at lower levels, but
        generally to a lesser extent. A lot of the opening strategy depends on
        the individual mindset of the player, with some players naturally
        playing a more attacking game than others.
      

        Below are articles on various well-known (and some not-so-well-known)
        openings, which discuss options for placement of balls, and responses to
        them. For the purposes of simplicity, in the examples below, the balls
        will always be played in the following order:
      


 Blue
        

 Red
        


          Black
        


          Yellow
        


Note: there is no ball order or sequence in which the balls need to
          be added to the game in croquet - the above order is simply to keep
          things consistent for the diagrams and explanations.


        As you can probably imagine, the options in the opening are endless.
        This article attempts to talk through some of the most common options,
        and some of the most common responses to them, with the idea of
        clarifying some of the thought processes behind them.
      

The Dream Leave

        Many of the openings below will reference something known as the Dream
        Leave - this is a scenario where the third turn ball (black) has hit and
        arranged the court as follows:
      




            Black hit on turn 3 and set a dream leave
          



        Black has retrieved red from wherever it was on the court and placed it
        slightly in-lawn from the west boundary, north of peg-high, and left
        blue a rush to it from the east boundary. This leave gives no short shot
        for yellow, and any miss by yellow will give blue a good break
        opportunity.

 First
        Ball Options
      

East Boundary

          The most common option selected by the first ball player. A ball to
          the east boundary, somewhere between level with H4 and H5, is chosen
          due to its relative distance from both baulk lines and from H1. It is
          a completely non-threatening ball and allows the second ball player to
          dictate the nature of the game, be it defensive or aggressive.
        
In-lawn East Boundary ball

          A variation on the standard east boundary ball, the in-lawn east
          boundary ball is struck out in the same area as the standard east
          boundary ball, but purposefully left about 1 yard in from the yardline
          area. The idea behind that is so that black can play its third turn
          shot out behind blue and leave itself a rush in-court. This play
          discourages responses like a west boundary tice from red.
        
Supershot

          A supershot ball is a first-turn ball placed near the middle of the
          court, normally between H5 and peg and a couple of yards west of the
          centre line. This is the most aggressive sensible option for the first
          ball, and signals your intent to your opponent that you want no grey
          area. Given its proximity to H1, a supershot ball generally gives a
          good chance for a break for either player, depending on whether the
          third-turn, fourth-turn or fifth-turn shots are hit.
        

          There are variations on the length of the supershot, with a supershot
          played to near the peg being a poorer pioneer for H1 but having the
          advantage of lengthening any fourth-turn shot by yellow at it.
        
Anti-duffer

          This opening is an attempt to try and pre-empt the second-turn
          response and discourage a "duffer tice" by red. To lay an anti-duffer,
          you hit blue to a spot somewhere between H6 and the peg, and 1-2 yards
          west of the east boundary. The idea of placing a ball here is that if
          the opponent were to lay a duffer tice with red,
          then it gives black a good chance to hit red and take off behind blue
          for a rush to H1 on turn 3. It is a leave that is generally only used
          by strong players who have a realistic chance of a third-turn break in
          the first place.
        




              Some common first-ball scenarios
            


Unusual first-turn options

          The croquet court is a big place and so there really are endless
          options for where to place balls in the opening. Often an unusual
          option first-turn will yield good results by confusing the opponent!
        
C4 first ball

          Not often seen these days due to a preference for an east boundary
          ball 10 yards further north. A weakness of this opening is that
          shooting at partner on turn 3 and missing is liable to leave a double
          target for yellow. It also generally encourages yellow to take an
          aggressive shot on turn 4; however on a difficult lawn this opening
          can have some advantages, with any hit by yellow on turn 4 at balls in
          C4 leaving little room to promote balls into the court due to the
          close proximity to the corner.
        
C2 first ball

          Playing blue into C2 first turn can often catch the opponent off
          guard. This opening attempts to flip the tables on red and yellow by
          trying to ensure a defensive opening for blue and black. This can be a
          good option where blue and black are the stronger players and want to
          prevent aggressive second-turn options by red and yellow. Of course,
          there are options available to red and yellow which negate blue and
          black's defensive preferences.
        
Micro tice

          As unusual options go, this is right up there. This option would not
          be recommended when playing a strong player, but nevertheless is very
          interesting. The micro tice is a ball played from the end of A baulk
          towards the east boundary, but only 2-3 yards towards it, leaving a
          2-3 yard roquet for the opponent on the second turn. This length of
          shot cannot really be refused, but leaving red a croquet stroke from
          south-west of hoop 4 on the second turn of the game gives no real
          break prospects. Often the second turn player will attempt an approach
          to H1 and fail it, leaving a 6-yard roquet with two balls near H1 for
          black. This opening relies more on a tactical mistake from red than
          anything else
        
C1 / C3 opening

          Occasionally seen. Not a good opening against any experienced
          opponent, but occasionally yields results. This first-turn option is
          not to be recommended. A first-turn ball in C1 followed by a
          second-turn response to C3 (or vice versa) is a killer blow to black's
          turn.
        
Back to top




 Second
        Ball Options
      


          This is where things start to get a little interesting. For the most
          part, the opening is dictated by the second ball response, and there
          are many more options available.
        
Response to East Boundary ball
Standard Tice

          The standard tice is one of the most popular responses to an east
          boundary ball at club-level croquet. Although in recent years it has
          fallen out of favour with top players (likely due to an increase in
          the standard of shooting), it is still a great opening that gives good
          chances to both sides.
        

          The standard tice is where red is played to the west boundary, and the
          distance it is placed north of C1 needs to be carefully considered by
          the striker or red. The name "tice" indicates that the distance should
          be enticing for the player of black to shoot at and so a distance of
          between about 8 and 13 yards is common. As a general rule, if possible
          the distance chosen should either be about 1 yard longer than the
          opponent's critical distance (the distance at which someone hits 50%
          of their shots) or 1 yard shorter (or equal to) your own critical
          distance. Obviously this cannot be achieved if your opponent has a
          longer critical distance than you do, so it is better to err slightly
          on the longer side.
        

          If blue is an in-lawn east boundary ball, laying a standard tice is
          risky, as black can quite easily lay a rush directly to it on the
          third turn.
        
C2 ball

          Probably the most common response to the east boundary ball today is
          the second-turn ball to 6" south of C2. The reason for playing just
          south of C2 is that if in the unlikely event of black shooting at red
          on turn 3, a miss will likely leave yellow a double target. The idea
          of red near C2 means that red is buried in a defensive position, and
          signals yellow's intent to shoot at blue and black on turn 4.
        

          If blue is slightly in-lawn, then C2 is the safest and most defensive
          response with red.
        
Duffer tice

          One of the more aggressive responses for red is the duffer tice. This
          is a ball that is placed usually about 2-feet north and a few inches
          east of penultimate. This is similarly enticing for the opponent to
          shoot (just as with a standard tice) but in this case a miss is
          usually more critical - any third turn shot at the duffer is in the
          direction of A baulk so black usually takes the shot gently - and by
          doing so is more likely to miss. Black missing leaves two balls in the
          centre of the court, giving yellow a great chance on turn 4. The
          duffer tice is a great option for weaker players playing against
          stronger players, and also for anyone confident in hitting 10 yarders.
        

          Between two very strong players a duffer tice is still a popular
          opening. There are variations on the placement of the ball near
          penult, based on the strength of the opponent. It is common to see a
          duffer tice placed level with, or south of, H6, particularly if the
          striker of red and yellow is a very good shot and is confident to hit
          an 11-yarder on turn 4. In a game between experts, the placement of
          red is sometimes moved to the west of H6 to discourage a third-turn
          break after a hit from black at blue.
        
C4 ball

          This option is very popular in New Zealand and although a mirror image
          of the C2 ball, is a lot more aggressive. Placing red 6" north of C4
          not only gives negligible break prospects to black on turn 3 but also
          signals your intent to hit fourth-turn with yellow and have a break. A
          miss at partner by black on turn 3 gives you a 13-yard shot for a
          4-ball break, and a miss by black at red on turn 3 usually gives a
          double target.
        
Shoot at first-turn ball

          A slightly counter-intuitive option but nonetheless an interesting
          one. Shooting red at blue on turn 2 and hitting gives no break
          prospects, but a miss also leaves very slim break prospects for black
          on turn 3 if it hits, unless black is a very strong player. With this
          opening it is quite common to see misses on both turns 2 and 3, and
          often a triple target for yellow at the other 3 balls on turn 4 from B
          baulk.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to east boundary opening
            


Response to Supershot ball

          The supershot ball is the most aggressive opening that the first-turn
          player can use. There are several responses to this which need to be
          considered, based on your assessment of your opponent's ability and
          whether the opponent has realistic prospects of a break to 4-back if
          they do manage to hit 3rd turn.
        
C2 response

          The C2 response is a ball played about 6" south of C2. This is a
          strong response to a supershot against almost all players. If the
          player of black wants to attempt a third-turn break, they will have to
          hit a 13-yarder and play a very difficult croquet stroke out of C2 to
          get a rush to H1, and this is by no means guaranteed. On the other
          hand, a miss by black at red on turn 3 will leave yellow a double
          target and a 4-ball break if hit.
        




              It is important to finish a few inches south of C2 with red as it
              will mean black missing on either side of it will leave a double
              target. Above is a comparison of yellow's target after a
              third-turn miss by black at red, firstly with red in C2 and
              secondly with red a few inches south of C2
            



          There are only a handful of players in the world where the C2 ball is
          not a great response - players who would expect to hit the 13 yarder
          most of the time and also be good enough at croquet strokes to expect
          to get a rush to H1 on the supershot ball. Against these players the
          strategy of lengthing the 3rd turn shot would be preferred.
        
C4 response

          Mirror image to the C2 response, this ball is played 6" north of C4.
          Consider this if blue (the supershot ball) is placed further north
          than normal (somewhere near peg-high), or is in a particular spot
          which may have H4 obscuring any croquet stroke from C4 towards it. It
          otherwise gives all the same advantages as the C2 response
        
Max Distance response

          As a counter to the very top players hitting the ball in C2 most of
          the time, the max distance response became popular - this is where red
          is played to the east boundary about level with the peg on the east
          boundary, leaving the longest shot possible for black. This response
          grants black a shot from C3 through red and into C4, reducing yellow's
          fourth-turn prospects - it relies more on black missing red than
          trying to make any break pick-up by black more difficult. Generally a
          good option against the very best players, but against most players is
          unnecessary.  
The reason why max distance on the east boundary is chosen instead of the equivalent max distance spot on the west boundary is that it is slightly further from the supershot ball (blue), which is slightly south-west of the peg.  Assuming that the shots on turns 3 and 4 are missed, blue's shot at red & yellow on the east boundary will be a couple of yards longer than the equivalent shot to the west boundary.  
Supershot lag

          The response for red to lag to a spot 3-4 yards east and 1-2 yards
          north of the supershot ball is a very strong and very under-used
          response to the supershot. This is a good tactic when playing someone
          who is a very good shot, and in particular if the supershot ball
          itself is quite deep (nearer the peg than H5). Placing red beside blue
          nullifies the strength of black's shooting by encouraging black to
          take its third turn shot gently (which is generally less accurate), or
          risk shooting hard and missing into B baulk, conceding a 4-ball break.
          In this case, black may choose not to shoot at all, and instead also
          lag to a position wide of the other two balls, meaning that red and
          yellow have successfully turned the tables of the supershot opening
          and enabled yellow to have the first attempted roquet.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to supershot opening
            


Roquet the Supershot ball

          The ultimate way to nullify the supershot ball - roquet it on the
          second turn. After roqueting blue with red, there are several options
          available. You can croquet blue towards C2 and then fire red off 6"
          north of C4. A more aggressive option would be to croquet blue
          north-west of H2 and fire red off the south boundary, south of H4 -
          this leaves black a choice of 7-8 yarders but minimal break prospects
          and difficult strokes with their third turn in order to distance the
          balls from baulk. A more novel option would be to crosswire blue and
          red at the peg, which leaves only a 17-yard shot for black with a
          baulk line in the background. An even more interesting option might be
          to roll blue close to the peg, either east or west, and then play red
          a yard or two away from it, wiring blue's backswing at red. This means
          that black probably has no lag option towards blue that doesn't leave
          a double-target for yellow.
        
Response to unusual first-turn options
Response to a first-turn C2 ball

          A first-turn C2 ball is an attempt by blue to make red conform to a
          defensive opening. Red could of course do this if it wants, by playing
          6" north of C4, or even by just having a "standard" east boundary
          ball; however a better option to negate blue's attempt at dictating
          the opening might be to set a duffer tice - this is the ultimate
          aggressive response to the C2 ball, and means that black is suddenly
          faced with having to hit a 10-13 yarder on turn 3 or risk leaving the
          same for yellow next turn, and a laid break.
        
Back to top



 Third
        Ball Options
      

        For the vast majority of players, if they manage to hit in on the third
        turn of the game, they will and should be looking to make a dream leave
        (see top of page) or similar, possibly with red near the peg and blue &
        black with a rush towards it. There are exceptions to this line of play,
        mainly with supershot openings, but unless otherwise stated, the
        standard play would be to try and set a dream leave.
      

Response to WB tice after EB opening

          Realistically, black will not be attempting to make any break on turn
          3 if it manages to hit in. The player of black has to make a judgement
          call on their likelihood of hitting the standard tice vs their
          opponent's likelihood of missing it.
        


            If the tice is long, the best response is probably to shoot black at
            blue from A baulk. Missing black at blue leaves the free shot at the
            tice for yellow of course, which does give yellow fairly good
            prospects if hit. If the tice is extremely long, say peg-high, then
            black could quite feasibly just lag at blue and attempt to leave a
            rush to red. Bear in mind that playing this lag so early in the game
            may be difficult as you may not have the pace of the court - and
            there is a risk that lagging at blue and falling short will leave
            yellow a double target on turn 4.
          

            Another option if black is uncertain, would be to shoot at blue from
            C3, and missing through to C4. This hedges black's bets somewhat, as
            it is still taking a shot at a ball and still somewhat joining with
            partner ball, but does not give good break prospects to the opponent
            if yellow hits, due to the proximity of blue and black to one
            another. Yellow is faced with a long takeoff from red towards blue
            and black and in all likelihood will not get a rush to H1 from this
            position.
          

            The third option is of course to shoot at the tice itself. Hitting
            red will give the opportunity to make a dream leave (as shown at the
            top of the page). Missing red will send black towards C2, which will
            give black a free shot back through red and yellow if yellow misses
            its fourth-turn shot at red.
          





              Some common third-ball responses to a standard tice
            


Response to C2 ball after EB opening

          There are two common options after a second-turn C2 ball - both
          consist of shooting at partner. If partner is hit, then usually the
          play will be to take off to the red in C2, roquet it and then croquet
          it either into the centre of the court, or along the west boundary,
          then lag back to partner and leave a rush in-court. However, consider
          a game where you are the stronger player playing a very capable weaker
          player, if you do hit partner third turn, you can elect to just set a
          rush to the C2 ball instead of trying to retrieve it from C2. As the
          stronger player you may prefer this line of play, instead of digging
          out the C2 ball only for your opponent to hit on turn 4 and have an
          easy break.
        

          Usually the third-turn shot at partner with black will be from A
          baulk, joining up on the east boundary if missed. This leaves a long
          double target for yellow from the end of B baulk. A more defensive
          play would be to shoot at partner from C3 into C4. Doing this leaves
          almost no break prospects fourth-turn for yellow but, depending on the
          distance between blue and black, may give them the opportunity to join
          up.
        

          Another option for black on turn 3 would be to shoot at red in C2 -
          however usually this is only a viable option if red is exactly in the
          corner, as it will mean that missing red on the right leaves no double
          target for yellow. Alternatively, another option would be for black to
          join up with red near C2, about 3-4 feet south of it. Doing so leaves
          no double target from B baulk and gives good break prospects to black
          if yellow misses the 13 yarder, although it must be remembered that
          yellow also has good prospects if it hits the 13 yarder. Black joining
          up with red also leaves a defensive shot for yellow at blue from C3 to
          C4 which, if missed, leaves black a very long and tricky takeoff from
          C2 to the east boundary.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a C2 ball
            


Response to C2 / C4 ball after Supershot opening

          The third-turn response to this option depends greatly on your ability
          and also the ability of your opponent. Before you lay the supershot,
          you need to ask yourself "am I realistically good enough to play a
          third-turn break to 4-back?". If the answer is no, then that does not
          mean that the supershot opening is a bad idea at all, but it just
          means that you may want to reassess your third-turn response.
          Additionally, if you are playing someone that you believe is much
          better than you are, then trying to give yourself a 4-ball break on
          turn 5 is exactly what you should be trying to achieve. Therefore,
          instead of trying to roquet the 13 yard shot of black at red just
          south of C2 (or just north of C4), you can instead look to join up
          with the ball 3-4 feet away, ensuring to leave no double target. This
          puts a great deal of pressure on your stronger opponent to then hit a
          13 yarder or else concede a 4-ball break to you.
        

          If you believe you are good enough to hit on turn 3 and play a break,
          then the answer is simple - hit red near C2 and go round.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / C2 ball
            


Response to EB ball after Supershot opening

          In most cases, the third-turn response to a max distance ball is to
          try and hit it from C3, missing into C4. Again, however, you should
          evaluate your own likelihood of playing a break to 4-back with only 3
          balls on the lawn if you hit, and so you may want to consider lagging
          to the ball, a couple of yards in-lawn from the east boundary.
        

          If the ball on the east boundary is south of the peg, it is tempting
          to simply shoot at it from A baulk. Missing will of course leave a
          double from B baulk, but the odds of yellow then hitting a double
          target from 20+ yards is no certainty. Alternatively, if the
          second-turn ball is around peg-high, then shooting at it from B baulk
          from a few yards west of C3 and missing often results in a fairly even
          spread of the balls, with your black ball being approximately 8 yards
          south of red and 8 yards north of C4. This again is technically a
          double target from somewhere on B Baulk, but given the distance
          between red and black, is easily missed and will leave your black ball
          a shot of only 8 yards.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / max distance
              ball
            


Response to C4 ball after EB opening

          This opening creates one of the more interesting third-turn decisions.
          A second-turn ball 6" north of C4 is a very threatening position and
          therefore the options will as follows:
        


            Shoot at partner
            
Hit - set a dream leave

                Miss - leaves yellow a 13-yard shot at red in C4 for a 4-ball
                break
              



            Shoot at opponent near C4 from A baulk
            

                Hit - set a dream leave (you may want to have a go at gaining a
                rush to H1 on partner)
              

                Miss - leave a 13-yard double for yellow (but slightly tricky
                break pick-up)
              



            Join up with opponent near C4, leaving no double
            

                If red is 3-6" north of C4 - join a yard north of it from A
                baulk
                
No short double target is left for yellow

                    Yellow still only has a 13-yard shot for the innings (but a
                    slightly tricky break pick-up)
                  



                If red is ~12" north of C4 - shoot from C3 through to C4
                

                    Enables black to have a shot (albeit very long) to attempt
                    to hit and set a dream leave
                  




Black to C2


              By burying itself in C2, this enables black to kill off the
              aggression by red and yellow. Any miss by yellow will leave a 9
              yarder (at most) for blue
            






              Some common third-ball responses to a C4 ball
            



          A personal preference of mine is to shoot third-turn at the ball near
          C4 from A baulk, because hitting gives me control of the court, and I
          miss often enough by more than several inches so as not to leave a
          double.
        

          Be on the lookout for cannons around C4 as part of this opening -
          there is often a good opportunity to bombard a live ball across to H1
          while playing a croquet stroke towards blue on the east boundary. This
          can make picking up the first break a great deal easier.
        
Response to duffer tice after EB opening

          The duffer tice is one of my favourite openings. Because of the
          placement of red near H6, a miss by black from the end of B baulk will
          be headed towards A baulk and give an easy start for yellow. That is
          why we see the ~9 yard shot at red refused so often, even by very
          strong players!
        

          If black does decide to shoot at the duffer and hits, then not a great
          deal of options are available other than to take off to partner ball
          (usually nudging red towards the peg in the process), and leave a rush
          towards red, and then hope for a fourth-turn miss by yellow.
        

          Another option for shooting at the duffer is doing so from C3,
          shooting across the court and missing to around peg-high (or just
          south of peg-high) on the west boundary. This is the most defensive
          shot available in that a miss gives no break to yellow if yellow hits
          red, but it also does not put any pressure on yellow's shot at red.
          Often times, when black misses the shot from C3 at red, it will end up
          south of peg-high on the west boundary and be a tempting free shot for
          yellow from C1.
        

          Shooting at partner ball on turn 3 is the most aggressive line of play
          - taking the shot from A baulk and hitting gives the opportunity to
          play a big croquet stroke loading partner to H2 and attempting to get
          a rush to H1 on the duffer ball - it is a big shot and the break
          chances are normally only reasonable for very strong players. Missing
          partner from A baulk on the other hand gives yellow a ~9 yard shot and
          very strong break prospects. It is therefore more usual to see black
          shoot at blue from C3 which, although longer, doesn't make all the
          balls available to yellow if black misses blue and yellow hits red. It
          also means that blue and black maintain a wide join and have realistic
          prospects of hitting back in if yellow misses red.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a duffer tice
            


Response to 2 balls on EB

          If red has shot at blue on turn 2 and missed, leaving both balls on
          the east boundary, you should carefully evaluate your response based
          on the strength of your opponent. If you and your opponent are evenly
          matched but not world class players, or especially if your opponent is
          a much stronger player than you, then the best thing to do here may be
          to simply ignore the two balls on the east boundary and lag black into
          the middle of the court and wait for yellow to miss. This potentially
          presents you with an immediate break with a ball in the middle of the
          court.
        

          In a match between two very strong players it would be unusual to see
          no shot taken on turn 3, and if hit, some attempt at digging out a
          3-ball break.
        
Response to 2 balls in-court

          In a situation where you have laid a supershot with blue, and red has
          lagged a couple of yards north east of your supershot ball, if there
          is no double target to be had from anywhere on the baulk lines, you
          must again consider your expectations after hitting third turn vs your
          opponent's likelihood of hitting fourth turn. As with previous
          options, if you are playing an opponent who on paper is a much
          stronger player, the percentage play is usually to lag the black ball
          into the middle of the court beside the other two balls (being mindful
          not to leave a double target from anywhere), which will put pressure
          on your stronger opponent to hit in or else concede the first break
          opportunity to you.
        

          If you do want to shoot with black at one of the balls in the middle,
          then consider either shooting at the easterly ball from C1 (you may
          even be able to shoot hard at this without missing to B baulk), or
          alternatively shooting at a medium pace at either blue or red from the
          closest point on A baulk. If you do shoot from the closest point, be
          sure to hit at a pace to finish slightly south of H6, both so that
          black is not a short shot from B baulk, and so that any double target
          that you leave has plenty of space between the front and back ball.
        

          If you are facing a third turn shot with black after red has
          cross-wired blue and red at the peg, check first to see if there is a
          point which you can lag to where blue won't be wired from black, and
          which won't be giving a double target from either baulk line - if
          there is such a spot, then that is the best place to lag to.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to supershot lag
            


Back to top



 Fourth Ball Options
      

The fourth-turn response is usually actually more simple than then third-turn response - although there are more possible scenarios, they almost always result in yellow trying to roquet something.  
      

Response to ignored WB tice
When black has ignored a standard west boundary tice and insetad shot at (and missed) partner on the east boundary, the obvious response is to then try and hit red yourself from C1.  If the placement of red is good, you should have ~50% chance of hitting in.  Your break prospects after hitting red are actually quite good, as you will play a take off from red to blue & black, which will automatically be sending red towards H2 as a pioneer.  On the other hand, a miss with yellow through red into C2 only gives fairly mediocre break prospects to blue & black in the next turn.
Response to missed WB tice
If black did indeed shoot at red (and miss) from C1 in the previous turn, then the obvious response is to shoot at red yourself, but from a point east of C1 so that a miss will leave yellow joined with red.  If you hit red, your best line of play would be to roll red &  yellow towards C1 and lay a rush for your next turn.  A miss from red at yellow will of course leave black a shot through red and yellow from C2 to C1 but is likely to be a very long shot at a single ball target.  A miss from black on turn 5 here also gives you a good chance at establishing a break on turn 5.  




              If black has missed the standard tice, it leaves a good opportunity to join up with red on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C2 ball after EB opening
Having played red into C2 on turn 2, if black ignores red and simply joins with blue (which is likely), then against most players your best line of play would be to shoot at blue and black with red.  Whether you shoot from A baulk or B baulk depends on factors such as the distance between blue and black (whether it is easy to make a double target from B baulk or A baulk) and the flatness of the east boundary.  If the black ball missed blue badly on the left on turn 3, blue and black may well be 2+ yards apart on the east boundary, so there is a defensive option available to yellow as well - shoot from C3 through to C4, where a miss would not give blue & black any easy opening.
If you are the weaker player against a very strong opponent, then there is a case for shooting yellow at red - at 13 yards, it is significantly shorter than any other available shot and is therefore your best chance at winning the opening.  Red missing yellow gives blue a relatively easy start and a probable break, but against a very strong opponent it can still be worth the risk.  




              Fourth-turn responses for yellow when partner is in C2 and opponent balls are on the east boundary.  
            


Response to joined / missed C2 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, if black has for some reason shot at red in C2, then assuming a double target has been left, your best aggressive option is to shoot at this, preferably hitting the northern ball, from B baulk.  A hit or a miss here will give fairly good break prospects to whomever plays the next shot, given C2's proximity to H2 - a semi-good pioneer can usually be sent to H2 while obtaining a rush to H1.
If black has instead joined up a yard south of red on turn 2, you have no double target (except from C1, but let's not consider that).  Now you have fundamentally two options - either shoot yellow at red which will give a good break opportunity if hit (and concede a good break opportunity to black if missed), or take a more defensive line by shooting yellow at blue from C3 into C4.  If yellow misses this shot, it does give black a 1-yard roquet at red for the innings, however it not only gives no break prospects, but also requires black to play several good strokes in order to have a good leave.  Black's take off from C2 to blue on the east boundary is a difficult shot, and if black doesn't succeed in roqueting blue in its next shot (either taking off short and missing blue, or taking off too far and sending black out) then yellow will have a 9-10 yard shot at blue & black from near C4.




              If black has joined a yard south of red near C2, the yellow has aggressive and defensive options available
            


Response to missed EB ball after Supershot opening
The response here depends a lot on both the length of the supershot ball and what option black chose on turn 3.  Firstly let's assume the most common scenario, with blue halfway between H5 and peg, and 1-2 yards west of the centre line, and red approximately peg high on the EB, and black in or near C4.  In this situation the best option is normally to shoot at red from A baulk, with a miss joining up around 1 yard north of it.  This leaves blue a 15-yarder at red & yellow but difficult break prospects for both players, whomever plays the next shot. 




              The common response after a third-turn miss by black at red to C4, is for yellow to shoot at red, joining if missing.  An aggressive line is to shoot at black.  A third option is yellow at blue, which is shorter and will win you the innings, but only gives good break prospects if red and black are near to each other
            


As the weaker player against a stronger player, a very aggressive line of play would be to shoot yellow from A baulk at black in C4 - this is very black and white, as a hit will give you a good chance for a 4-ball break and a miss will give black the same chance.  As the weaker player, you can strongly consider this option.  
Consider for a moment that black's third-turn shot missed red from A baulk, or perhaps missed red from west of C3, finishing 5-10 yards south of red.  In this case, yellow for look for possible double targets available from B baulk.  Consider, too, the shortest shot available, which is yellow at blue from A baulk - this is likely a 11-13 yard shot which, if hit, gives good break prospects to yellow because red and black are close together.
Response to ignored duffer tice
The vast majority of the time the best response to black ignoring red's duffer tice, is for yellow to shoot hard at red from B baulk.  Usually a duffer tice is only 9-10 yards and so it will be, by far, the shortest shot for yellow.




              The majority of the time, the fourth turn response would be to shoot yellow at the duffer.  Against a very strong player, you might be tempted by yellow at black in C4 which, although 3 yards longer, gives an easy start to your break
            


An expection to this would be if blue & black are joined on the east boundary leaving a good double target from A baulk, and so you may want to consider shooting at that instead.  Another option to consider is if black shot and missed blue from C3 to C4.  If you are playing against a much stronger opponent you may consider shooting yellow at black from A baulk into C4.  This shot is 3 yards longer than yellow at red from B baulk, but hitting this shot gives you vastly stronger break prospects than if you hit red first.
Response to missed duffer tice
If black misses the duffer tice (red) gently, the logical response is to shoot hard at either red from B baulk or black from A baulk (whichever is closer).  If black misses the duffer tice from C3 across to the west boundary, you may consider shooting at black from C1 through to C2, particularly if black is south of peg-high.  




              If the duffer tice is still in its original position at the start of turn 4, the general response is for yellow to shoot at red given its proximity to B baulk.  If black missed red from C3 however, it can be tempting to shoot at black from C1 on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C4 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, red a few inches north of C4 and black 1 yard north of blue, yellow's default response should be to shoot at red from A baulk.  Hitting this shot gives a great break opportunity, as it is a very natural stroke to croquet red to H2 while approaching blue & black up the east boundary.  
Response to 3 balls on EB
In this instance, you simply need to hit one of the balls on the east boundary - from either A baulk or B baulk, depending on length and available targets.
Response to 3 balls in-court
A supershot opening with lags by red and black essentially forces yellow to shoot at the closest ball.  A very black and white opening, good break prospects for both players on turn 4 or 5, depending on whether yellow hits or misses.  Often times, black will have take a gentle lag while attempting a roquet at either blue or red on turn 3, so this may also give yellow some target to shoot at on turn 4.

Conclusion
If you have gotten to the bottom of this article, you have probably realised by now that the number of opening options are vast.  This article could not hope to cover every eventuality, and nor does it present any new or unseen openings; rather it serves to talk through the options and thought processes for choosing a particular option, and I hope it has been useful.

Openings

        The opening is the battle between the two sides to be the first to gain
        the upper hand. Generally when we talk about openings in croquet, we are
        referring to the first 4 turns. At the very top level it is where games
        are won and lost, but at all levels it provides a fascinating array of
        options for bluffing and double-bluffing your opponent.
      
Opening priorities
As the stronger player

        The stronger player who is playing a dangerous but less experienced /
        weaker player will generally approach the opening with the intent of not
        giving away an easy break, and hence a more defensive mindset. Openings
        where there is a lot of grey area, balls on boundaries and in corners
        are best for this. The stronger player will generally rely on their
        better all-round game in order to win, and is more comfortable with
        digging balls out slowly into a break.
      
As the weaker player

        The weaker player should approach a game against a much stronger
        opponent with an attacking mindset - they will not be afraid to take on
        relatively short shots that give laid breaks, even if it means conceding
        a laid break if they miss. The weaker player should favour openings that
        have balls in-lawn and should be looking to put pressure on the stronger
        player to have to hit in.
      
Evenly-matched players

        It is quite common to see very aggressive, black and white, openings
        when two very strong players play against each other. The same is true
        for openings between evenly-matched players at lower levels, but
        generally to a lesser extent. A lot of the opening strategy depends on
        the individual mindset of the player, with some players naturally
        playing a more attacking game than others.
      

        Below are articles on various well-known (and some not-so-well-known)
        openings, which discuss options for placement of balls, and responses to
        them. For the purposes of simplicity, in the examples below, the balls
        will always be played in the following order:
      


 Blue
        

 Red
        


          Black
        


          Yellow
        


Note: there is no ball order or sequence in which the balls need to
          be added to the game in croquet - the above order is simply to keep
          things consistent for the diagrams and explanations.


        As you can probably imagine, the options in the opening are endless.
        This article attempts to talk through some of the most common options,
        and some of the most common responses to them, with the idea of
        clarifying some of the thought processes behind them.
      

The Dream Leave

        Many of the openings below will reference something known as the Dream
        Leave - this is a scenario where the third turn ball (black) has hit and
        arranged the court as follows:
      




            Black hit on turn 3 and set a dream leave
          



        Black has retrieved red from wherever it was on the court and placed it
        slightly in-lawn from the west boundary, north of peg-high, and left
        blue a rush to it from the east boundary. This leave gives no short shot
        for yellow, and any miss by yellow will give blue a good break
        opportunity.

 First
        Ball Options
      

East Boundary

          The most common option selected by the first ball player. A ball to
          the east boundary, somewhere between level with H4 and H5, is chosen
          due to its relative distance from both baulk lines and from H1. It is
          a completely non-threatening ball and allows the second ball player to
          dictate the nature of the game, be it defensive or aggressive.
        
In-lawn East Boundary ball

          A variation on the standard east boundary ball, the in-lawn east
          boundary ball is struck out in the same area as the standard east
          boundary ball, but purposefully left about 1 yard in from the yardline
          area. The idea behind that is so that black can play its third turn
          shot out behind blue and leave itself a rush in-court. This play
          discourages responses like a west boundary tice from red.
        
Supershot

          A supershot ball is a first-turn ball placed near the middle of the
          court, normally between H5 and peg and a couple of yards west of the
          centre line. This is the most aggressive sensible option for the first
          ball, and signals your intent to your opponent that you want no grey
          area. Given its proximity to H1, a supershot ball generally gives a
          good chance for a break for either player, depending on whether the
          third-turn, fourth-turn or fifth-turn shots are hit.
        

          There are variations on the length of the supershot, with a supershot
          played to near the peg being a poorer pioneer for H1 but having the
          advantage of lengthening any fourth-turn shot by yellow at it.
        
Anti-duffer

          This opening is an attempt to try and pre-empt the second-turn
          response and discourage a "duffer tice" by red. To lay an anti-duffer,
          you hit blue to a spot somewhere between H6 and the peg, and 1-2 yards
          west of the east boundary. The idea of placing a ball here is that if
          the opponent were to lay a duffer tice with red,
          then it gives black a good chance to hit red and take off behind blue
          for a rush to H1 on turn 3. It is a leave that is generally only used
          by strong players who have a realistic chance of a third-turn break in
          the first place.
        




              Some common first-ball scenarios
            


Unusual first-turn options

          The croquet court is a big place and so there really are endless
          options for where to place balls in the opening. Often an unusual
          option first-turn will yield good results by confusing the opponent!
        
C4 first ball

          Not often seen these days due to a preference for an east boundary
          ball 10 yards further north. A weakness of this opening is that
          shooting at partner on turn 3 and missing is liable to leave a double
          target for yellow. It also generally encourages yellow to take an
          aggressive shot on turn 4; however on a difficult lawn this opening
          can have some advantages, with any hit by yellow on turn 4 at balls in
          C4 leaving little room to promote balls into the court due to the
          close proximity to the corner.
        
C2 first ball

          Playing blue into C2 first turn can often catch the opponent off
          guard. This opening attempts to flip the tables on red and yellow by
          trying to ensure a defensive opening for blue and black. This can be a
          good option where blue and black are the stronger players and want to
          prevent aggressive second-turn options by red and yellow. Of course,
          there are options available to red and yellow which negate blue and
          black's defensive preferences.
        
Micro tice

          As unusual options go, this is right up there. This option would not
          be recommended when playing a strong player, but nevertheless is very
          interesting. The micro tice is a ball played from the end of A baulk
          towards the east boundary, but only 2-3 yards towards it, leaving a
          2-3 yard roquet for the opponent on the second turn. This length of
          shot cannot really be refused, but leaving red a croquet stroke from
          south-west of hoop 4 on the second turn of the game gives no real
          break prospects. Often the second turn player will attempt an approach
          to H1 and fail it, leaving a 6-yard roquet with two balls near H1 for
          black. This opening relies more on a tactical mistake from red than
          anything else
        
C1 / C3 opening

          Occasionally seen. Not a good opening against any experienced
          opponent, but occasionally yields results. This first-turn option is
          not to be recommended. A first-turn ball in C1 followed by a
          second-turn response to C3 (or vice versa) is a killer blow to black's
          turn.
        
Back to top




 Second
        Ball Options
      


          This is where things start to get a little interesting. For the most
          part, the opening is dictated by the second ball response, and there
          are many more options available.
        
Response to East Boundary ball
Standard Tice

          The standard tice is one of the most popular responses to an east
          boundary ball at club-level croquet. Although in recent years it has
          fallen out of favour with top players (likely due to an increase in
          the standard of shooting), it is still a great opening that gives good
          chances to both sides.
        

          The standard tice is where red is played to the west boundary, and the
          distance it is placed north of C1 needs to be carefully considered by
          the striker or red. The name "tice" indicates that the distance should
          be enticing for the player of black to shoot at and so a distance of
          between about 8 and 13 yards is common. As a general rule, if possible
          the distance chosen should either be about 1 yard longer than the
          opponent's critical distance (the distance at which someone hits 50%
          of their shots) or 1 yard shorter (or equal to) your own critical
          distance. Obviously this cannot be achieved if your opponent has a
          longer critical distance than you do, so it is better to err slightly
          on the longer side.
        

          If blue is an in-lawn east boundary ball, laying a standard tice is
          risky, as black can quite easily lay a rush directly to it on the
          third turn.
        
C2 ball

          Probably the most common response to the east boundary ball today is
          the second-turn ball to 6" south of C2. The reason for playing just
          south of C2 is that if in the unlikely event of black shooting at red
          on turn 3, a miss will likely leave yellow a double target. The idea
          of red near C2 means that red is buried in a defensive position, and
          signals yellow's intent to shoot at blue and black on turn 4.
        

          If blue is slightly in-lawn, then C2 is the safest and most defensive
          response with red.
        
Duffer tice

          One of the more aggressive responses for red is the duffer tice. This
          is a ball that is placed usually about 2-feet north and a few inches
          east of penultimate. This is similarly enticing for the opponent to
          shoot (just as with a standard tice) but in this case a miss is
          usually more critical - any third turn shot at the duffer is in the
          direction of A baulk so black usually takes the shot gently - and by
          doing so is more likely to miss. Black missing leaves two balls in the
          centre of the court, giving yellow a great chance on turn 4. The
          duffer tice is a great option for weaker players playing against
          stronger players, and also for anyone confident in hitting 10 yarders.
        

          Between two very strong players a duffer tice is still a popular
          opening. There are variations on the placement of the ball near
          penult, based on the strength of the opponent. It is common to see a
          duffer tice placed level with, or south of, H6, particularly if the
          striker of red and yellow is a very good shot and is confident to hit
          an 11-yarder on turn 4. In a game between experts, the placement of
          red is sometimes moved to the west of H6 to discourage a third-turn
          break after a hit from black at blue.
        
C4 ball

          This option is very popular in New Zealand and although a mirror image
          of the C2 ball, is a lot more aggressive. Placing red 6" north of C4
          not only gives negligible break prospects to black on turn 3 but also
          signals your intent to hit fourth-turn with yellow and have a break. A
          miss at partner by black on turn 3 gives you a 13-yard shot for a
          4-ball break, and a miss by black at red on turn 3 usually gives a
          double target.
        
Shoot at first-turn ball

          A slightly counter-intuitive option but nonetheless an interesting
          one. Shooting red at blue on turn 2 and hitting gives no break
          prospects, but a miss also leaves very slim break prospects for black
          on turn 3 if it hits, unless black is a very strong player. With this
          opening it is quite common to see misses on both turns 2 and 3, and
          often a triple target for yellow at the other 3 balls on turn 4 from B
          baulk.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to east boundary opening
            


Response to Supershot ball

          The supershot ball is the most aggressive opening that the first-turn
          player can use. There are several responses to this which need to be
          considered, based on your assessment of your opponent's ability and
          whether the opponent has realistic prospects of a break to 4-back if
          they do manage to hit 3rd turn.
        
C2 response

          The C2 response is a ball played about 6" south of C2. This is a
          strong response to a supershot against almost all players. If the
          player of black wants to attempt a third-turn break, they will have to
          hit a 13-yarder and play a very difficult croquet stroke out of C2 to
          get a rush to H1, and this is by no means guaranteed. On the other
          hand, a miss by black at red on turn 3 will leave yellow a double
          target and a 4-ball break if hit.
        




              It is important to finish a few inches south of C2 with red as it
              will mean black missing on either side of it will leave a double
              target. Above is a comparison of yellow's target after a
              third-turn miss by black at red, firstly with red in C2 and
              secondly with red a few inches south of C2
            



          There are only a handful of players in the world where the C2 ball is
          not a great response - players who would expect to hit the 13 yarder
          most of the time and also be good enough at croquet strokes to expect
          to get a rush to H1 on the supershot ball. Against these players the
          strategy of lengthing the 3rd turn shot would be preferred.
        
C4 response

          Mirror image to the C2 response, this ball is played 6" north of C4.
          Consider this if blue (the supershot ball) is placed further north
          than normal (somewhere near peg-high), or is in a particular spot
          which may have H4 obscuring any croquet stroke from C4 towards it. It
          otherwise gives all the same advantages as the C2 response
        
Max Distance response

          As a counter to the very top players hitting the ball in C2 most of
          the time, the max distance response became popular - this is where red
          is played to the east boundary about level with the peg on the east
          boundary, leaving the longest shot possible for black. This response
          grants black a shot from C3 through red and into C4, reducing yellow's
          fourth-turn prospects - it relies more on black missing red than
          trying to make any break pick-up by black more difficult. Generally a
          good option against the very best players, but against most players is
          unnecessary.  
The reason why max distance on the east boundary is chosen instead of the equivalent max distance spot on the west boundary is that it is slightly further from the supershot ball (blue), which is slightly south-west of the peg.  Assuming that the shots on turns 3 and 4 are missed, blue's shot at red & yellow on the east boundary will be a couple of yards longer than the equivalent shot to the west boundary.  
Supershot lag

          The response for red to lag to a spot 3-4 yards east and 1-2 yards
          north of the supershot ball is a very strong and very under-used
          response to the supershot. This is a good tactic when playing someone
          who is a very good shot, and in particular if the supershot ball
          itself is quite deep (nearer the peg than H5). Placing red beside blue
          nullifies the strength of black's shooting by encouraging black to
          take its third turn shot gently (which is generally less accurate), or
          risk shooting hard and missing into B baulk, conceding a 4-ball break.
          In this case, black may choose not to shoot at all, and instead also
          lag to a position wide of the other two balls, meaning that red and
          yellow have successfully turned the tables of the supershot opening
          and enabled yellow to have the first attempted roquet.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to supershot opening
            


Roquet the Supershot ball

          The ultimate way to nullify the supershot ball - roquet it on the
          second turn. After roqueting blue with red, there are several options
          available. You can croquet blue towards C2 and then fire red off 6"
          north of C4. A more aggressive option would be to croquet blue
          north-west of H2 and fire red off the south boundary, south of H4 -
          this leaves black a choice of 7-8 yarders but minimal break prospects
          and difficult strokes with their third turn in order to distance the
          balls from baulk. A more novel option would be to crosswire blue and
          red at the peg, which leaves only a 17-yard shot for black with a
          baulk line in the background. An even more interesting option might be
          to roll blue close to the peg, either east or west, and then play red
          a yard or two away from it, wiring blue's backswing at red. This means
          that black probably has no lag option towards blue that doesn't leave
          a double-target for yellow.
        
Response to unusual first-turn options
Response to a first-turn C2 ball

          A first-turn C2 ball is an attempt by blue to make red conform to a
          defensive opening. Red could of course do this if it wants, by playing
          6" north of C4, or even by just having a "standard" east boundary
          ball; however a better option to negate blue's attempt at dictating
          the opening might be to set a duffer tice - this is the ultimate
          aggressive response to the C2 ball, and means that black is suddenly
          faced with having to hit a 10-13 yarder on turn 3 or risk leaving the
          same for yellow next turn, and a laid break.

 Third
        Ball Options
      

        For the vast majority of players, if they manage to hit in on the third
        turn of the game, they will and should be looking to make a dream leave
        (see top of page) or similar, possibly with red near the peg and blue &
        black with a rush towards it. There are exceptions to this line of play,
        mainly with supershot openings, but unless otherwise stated, the
        standard play would be to try and set a dream leave.
      

Response to WB tice after EB opening

          Realistically, black will not be attempting to make any break on turn
          3 if it manages to hit in. The player of black has to make a judgement
          call on their likelihood of hitting the standard tice vs their
          opponent's likelihood of missing it.
        


            If the tice is long, the best response is probably to shoot black at
            blue from A baulk. Missing black at blue leaves the free shot at the
            tice for yellow of course, which does give yellow fairly good
            prospects if hit. If the tice is extremely long, say peg-high, then
            black could quite feasibly just lag at blue and attempt to leave a
            rush to red. Bear in mind that playing this lag so early in the game
            may be difficult as you may not have the pace of the court - and
            there is a risk that lagging at blue and falling short will leave
            yellow a double target on turn 4.
          

            Another option if black is uncertain, would be to shoot at blue from
            C3, and missing through to C4. This hedges black's bets somewhat, as
            it is still taking a shot at a ball and still somewhat joining with
            partner ball, but does not give good break prospects to the opponent
            if yellow hits, due to the proximity of blue and black to one
            another. Yellow is faced with a long takeoff from red towards blue
            and black and in all likelihood will not get a rush to H1 from this
            position.
          

            The third option is of course to shoot at the tice itself. Hitting
            red will give the opportunity to make a dream leave (as shown at the
            top of the page). Missing red will send black towards C2, which will
            give black a free shot back through red and yellow if yellow misses
            its fourth-turn shot at red.
          





              Some common third-ball responses to a standard tice
            


Response to C2 ball after EB opening

          There are two common options after a second-turn C2 ball - both
          consist of shooting at partner. If partner is hit, then usually the
          play will be to take off to the red in C2, roquet it and then croquet
          it either into the centre of the court, or along the west boundary,
          then lag back to partner and leave a rush in-court. However, consider
          a game where you are the stronger player playing a very capable weaker
          player, if you do hit partner third turn, you can elect to just set a
          rush to the C2 ball instead of trying to retrieve it from C2. As the
          stronger player you may prefer this line of play, instead of digging
          out the C2 ball only for your opponent to hit on turn 4 and have an
          easy break.
        

          Usually the third-turn shot at partner with black will be from A
          baulk, joining up on the east boundary if missed. This leaves a long
          double target for yellow from the end of B baulk. A more defensive
          play would be to shoot at partner from C3 into C4. Doing this leaves
          almost no break prospects fourth-turn for yellow but, depending on the
          distance between blue and black, may give them the opportunity to join
          up.
        

          Another option for black on turn 3 would be to shoot at red in C2 -
          however usually this is only a viable option if red is exactly in the
          corner, as it will mean that missing red on the right leaves no double
          target for yellow. Alternatively, another option would be for black to
          join up with red near C2, about 3-4 feet south of it. Doing so leaves
          no double target from B baulk and gives good break prospects to black
          if yellow misses the 13 yarder, although it must be remembered that
          yellow also has good prospects if it hits the 13 yarder. Black joining
          up with red also leaves a defensive shot for yellow at blue from C3 to
          C4 which, if missed, leaves black a very long and tricky takeoff from
          C2 to the east boundary.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a C2 ball
            


Response to C2 / C4 ball after Supershot opening

          The third-turn response to this option depends greatly on your ability
          and also the ability of your opponent. Before you lay the supershot,
          you need to ask yourself "am I realistically good enough to play a
          third-turn break to 4-back?". If the answer is no, then that does not
          mean that the supershot opening is a bad idea at all, but it just
          means that you may want to reassess your third-turn response.
          Additionally, if you are playing someone that you believe is much
          better than you are, then trying to give yourself a 4-ball break on
          turn 5 is exactly what you should be trying to achieve. Therefore,
          instead of trying to roquet the 13 yard shot of black at red just
          south of C2 (or just north of C4), you can instead look to join up
          with the ball 3-4 feet away, ensuring to leave no double target. This
          puts a great deal of pressure on your stronger opponent to then hit a
          13 yarder or else concede a 4-ball break to you.
        

          If you believe you are good enough to hit on turn 3 and play a break,
          then the answer is simple - hit red near C2 and go round.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / C2 ball
            


Response to EB ball after Supershot opening

          In most cases, the third-turn response to a max distance ball is to
          try and hit it from C3, missing into C4. Again, however, you should
          evaluate your own likelihood of playing a break to 4-back with only 3
          balls on the lawn if you hit, and so you may want to consider lagging
          to the ball, a couple of yards in-lawn from the east boundary.
        

          If the ball on the east boundary is south of the peg, it is tempting
          to simply shoot at it from A baulk. Missing will of course leave a
          double from B baulk, but the odds of yellow then hitting a double
          target from 20+ yards is no certainty. Alternatively, if the
          second-turn ball is around peg-high, then shooting at it from B baulk
          from a few yards west of C3 and missing often results in a fairly even
          spread of the balls, with your black ball being approximately 8 yards
          south of red and 8 yards north of C4. This again is technically a
          double target from somewhere on B Baulk, but given the distance
          between red and black, is easily missed and will leave your black ball
          a shot of only 8 yards.

              ball
            


Response to C4 ball after EB opening

          This opening creates one of the more interesting third-turn decisions.
          A second-turn ball 6" north of C4 is a very threatening position and
          therefore the options will as follows:
        


            Shoot at partner
            
Hit - set a dream leave

                Miss - leaves yellow a 13-yard shot at red in C4 for a 4-ball
                break
              



            Shoot at opponent near C4 from A baulk
            

                Hit - set a dream leave (you may want to have a go at gaining a
                rush to H1 on partner)
              

                Miss - leave a 13-yard double for yellow (but slightly tricky
                break pick-up)
              



            Join up with opponent near C4, leaving no double
            

                If red is 3-6" north of C4 - join a yard north of it from A
                baulk
                
No short double target is left for yellow

                    Yellow still only has a 13-yard shot for the innings (but a
                    slightly tricky break pick-up)
                  



                If red is ~12" north of C4 - shoot from C3 through to C4
                

                    Enables black to have a shot (albeit very long) to attempt
                    to hit and set a dream leave
                  




Black to C2


              By burying itself in C2, this enables black to kill off the
              aggression by red and yellow. Any miss by yellow will leave a 9
              yarder (at most) for blue
            






              Some common third-ball responses to a C4 ball
            



          A personal preference of mine is to shoot third-turn at the ball near
          C4 from A baulk, because hitting gives me control of the court, and I
          miss often enough by more than several inches so as not to leave a
          double.
        

          Be on the lookout for cannons around C4 as part of this opening -
          there is often a good opportunity to bombard a live ball across to H1
          while playing a croquet stroke towards blue on the east boundary. This
          can make picking up the first break a great deal easier.
        
Response to duffer tice after EB opening

          The duffer tice is one of my favourite openings. Because of the
          placement of red near H6, a miss by black from the end of B baulk will
          be headed towards A baulk and give an easy start for yellow. That is
          why we see the ~9 yard shot at red refused so often, even by very
          strong players!
        

          If black does decide to shoot at the duffer and hits, then not a great
          deal of options are available other than to take off to partner ball
          (usually nudging red towards the peg in the process), and leave a rush
          towards red, and then hope for a fourth-turn miss by yellow.
        

          Another option for shooting at the duffer is doing so from C3,
          shooting across the court and missing to around peg-high (or just
          south of peg-high) on the west boundary. This is the most defensive
          shot available in that a miss gives no break to yellow if yellow hits
          red, but it also does not put any pressure on yellow's shot at red.
          Often times, when black misses the shot from C3 at red, it will end up
          south of peg-high on the west boundary and be a tempting free shot for
          yellow from C1.
        

          Shooting at partner ball on turn 3 is the most aggressive line of play
          - taking the shot from A baulk and hitting gives the opportunity to
          play a big croquet stroke loading partner to H2 and attempting to get
          a rush to H1 on the duffer ball - it is a big shot and the break
          chances are normally only reasonable for very strong players. Missing
          partner from A baulk on the other hand gives yellow a ~9 yard shot and
          very strong break prospects. It is therefore more usual to see black
          shoot at blue from C3 which, although longer, doesn't make all the
          balls available to yellow if black misses blue and yellow hits red. It
          also means that blue and black maintain a wide join and have realistic
          prospects of hitting back in if yellow misses red.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a duffer tice
            


Response to 2 balls on EB

          If red has shot at blue on turn 2 and missed, leaving both balls on
          the east boundary, you should carefully evaluate your response based
          on the strength of your opponent. If you and your opponent are evenly
          matched but not world class players, or especially if your opponent is
          a much stronger player than you, then the best thing to do here may be
          to simply ignore the two balls on the east boundary and lag black into
          the middle of the court and wait for yellow to miss. This potentially
          presents you with an immediate break with a ball in the middle of the
          court.
        

          In a match between two very strong players it would be unusual to see
          no shot taken on turn 3, and if hit, some attempt at digging out a
          3-ball break.
        
Response to 2 balls in-court

          In a situation where you have laid a supershot with blue, and red has
          lagged a couple of yards north east of your supershot ball, if there
          is no double target to be had from anywhere on the baulk lines, you
          must again consider your expectations after hitting third turn vs your
          opponent's likelihood of hitting fourth turn. As with previous
          options, if you are playing an opponent who on paper is a much
          stronger player, the percentage play is usually to lag the black ball
          into the middle of the court beside the other two balls (being mindful
          not to leave a double target from anywhere), which will put pressure
          on your stronger opponent to hit in or else concede the first break
          opportunity to you.
        

          If you do want to shoot with black at one of the balls in the middle,
          then consider either shooting at the easterly ball from C1 (you may
          even be able to shoot hard at this without missing to B baulk), or
          alternatively shooting at a medium pace at either blue or red from the
          closest point on A baulk. If you do shoot from the closest point, be
          sure to hit at a pace to finish slightly south of H6, both so that
          black is not a short shot from B baulk, and so that any double target
          that you leave has plenty of space between the front and back ball.
        

          If you are facing a third turn shot with black after red has
          cross-wired blue and red at the peg, check first to see if there is a
          point which you can lag to where blue won't be wired from black, and
          which won't be giving a double target from either baulk line - if
          there is such a spot, then that is the best place to lag to.

Back to top



 Fourth Ball Options
      

The fourth-turn response is usually actually more simple than then third-turn response - although there are more possible scenarios, they almost always result in yellow trying to roquet something.  
      

Response to ignored WB tice
When black has ignored a standard west boundary tice and insetad shot at (and missed) partner on the east boundary, the obvious response is to then try and hit red yourself from C1.  If the placement of red is good, you should have ~50% chance of hitting in.  Your break prospects after hitting red are actually quite good, as you will play a take off from red to blue & black, which will automatically be sending red towards H2 as a pioneer.  On the other hand, a miss with yellow through red into C2 only gives fairly mediocre break prospects to blue & black in the next turn.
Response to missed WB tice
If black did indeed shoot at red (and miss) from C1 in the previous turn, then the obvious response is to shoot at red yourself, but from a point east of C1 so that a miss will leave yellow joined with red.  If you hit red, your best line of play would be to roll red &  yellow towards C1 and lay a rush for your next turn.  A miss from red at yellow will of course leave black a shot through red and yellow from C2 to C1 but is likely to be a very long shot at a single ball target.  A miss from black on turn 5 here also gives you a good chance at establishing a break on turn 5.  




              If black has missed the standard tice, it leaves a good opportunity to join up with red on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C2 ball after EB opening
Having played red into C2 on turn 2, if black ignores red and simply joins with blue (which is likely), then against most players your best line of play would be to shoot at blue and black with red.  Whether you shoot from A baulk or B baulk depends on factors such as the distance between blue and black (whether it is easy to make a double target from B baulk or A baulk) and the flatness of the east boundary.  If the black ball missed blue badly on the left on turn 3, blue and black may well be 2+ yards apart on the east boundary, so there is a defensive option available to yellow as well - shoot from C3 through to C4, where a miss would not give blue & black any easy opening.
If you are the weaker player against a very strong opponent, then there is a case for shooting yellow at red - at 13 yards, it is significantly shorter than any other available shot and is therefore your best chance at winning the opening.  Red missing yellow gives blue a relatively easy start and a probable break, but against a very strong opponent it can still be worth the risk.  




              Fourth-turn responses for yellow when partner is in C2 and opponent balls are on the east boundary.  
            


Response to joined / missed C2 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, if black has for some reason shot at red in C2, then assuming a double target has been left, your best aggressive option is to shoot at this, preferably hitting the northern ball, from B baulk.  A hit or a miss here will give fairly good break prospects to whomever plays the next shot, given C2's proximity to H2 - a semi-good pioneer can usually be sent to H2 while obtaining a rush to H1.
If black has instead joined up a yard south of red on turn 2, you have no double target (except from C1, but let's not consider that).  Now you have fundamentally two options - either shoot yellow at red which will give a good break opportunity if hit (and concede a good break opportunity to black if missed), or take a more defensive line by shooting yellow at blue from C3 into C4.  If yellow misses this shot, it does give black a 1-yard roquet at red for the innings, however it not only gives no break prospects, but also requires black to play several good strokes in order to have a good leave.  Black's take off from C2 to blue on the east boundary is a difficult shot, and if black doesn't succeed in roqueting blue in its next shot (either taking off short and missing blue, or taking off too far and sending black out) then yellow will have a 9-10 yard shot at blue & black from near C4.




              If black has joined a yard south of red near C2, the yellow has aggressive and defensive options available
            


Response to missed EB ball after Supershot opening
The response here depends a lot on both the length of the supershot ball and what option black chose on turn 3.  Firstly let's assume the most common scenario, with blue halfway between H5 and peg, and 1-2 yards west of the centre line, and red approximately peg high on the EB, and black in or near C4.  In this situation the best option is normally to shoot at red from A baulk, with a miss joining up around 1 yard north of it.  This leaves blue a 15-yarder at red & yellow but difficult break prospects for both players, whomever plays the next shot. 




              The common response after a third-turn miss by black at red to C4, is for yellow to shoot at red, joining if missing.  An aggressive line is to shoot at black.  A third option is yellow at blue, which is shorter and will win you the innings, but only gives good break prospects if red and black are near to each other
            


As the weaker player against a stronger player, a very aggressive line of play would be to shoot yellow from A baulk at black in C4 - this is very black and white, as a hit will give you a good chance for a 4-ball break and a miss will give black the same chance.  As the weaker player, you can strongly consider this option.  
Consider for a moment that black's third-turn shot missed red from A baulk, or perhaps missed red from west of C3, finishing 5-10 yards south of red.  In this case, yellow for look for possible double targets available from B baulk.  Consider, too, the shortest shot available, which is yellow at blue from A baulk - this is likely a 11-13 yard shot which, if hit, gives good break prospects to yellow because red and black are close together.
Response to ignored duffer tice
The vast majority of the time the best response to black ignoring red's duffer tice, is for yellow to shoot hard at red from B baulk.  Usually a duffer tice is only 9-10 yards and so it will be, by far, the shortest shot for yellow.




              The majority of the time, the fourth turn response would be to shoot yellow at the duffer.  Against a very strong player, you might be tempted by yellow at black in C4 which, although 3 yards longer, gives an easy start to your break
            


An expection to this would be if blue & black are joined on the east boundary leaving a good double target from A baulk, and so you may want to consider shooting at that instead.  Another option to consider is if black shot and missed blue from C3 to C4.  If you are playing against a much stronger opponent you may consider shooting yellow at black from A baulk into C4.  This shot is 3 yards longer than yellow at red from B baulk, but hitting this shot gives you vastly stronger break prospects than if you hit red first.
Response to missed duffer tice
If black misses the duffer tice (red) gently, the logical response is to shoot hard at either red from B baulk or black from A baulk (whichever is closer).  If black misses the duffer tice from C3 across to the west boundary, you may consider shooting at black from C1 through to C2, particularly if black is south of peg-high.  




              If the duffer tice is still in its original position at the start of turn 4, the general response is for yellow to shoot at red given its proximity to B baulk.  If black missed red from C3 however, it can be tempting to shoot at black from C1 on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C4 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, red a few inches north of C4 and black 1 yard north of blue, yellow's default response should be to shoot at red from A baulk.  Hitting this shot gives a great break opportunity, as it is a very natural stroke to croquet red to H2 while approaching blue & black up the east boundary.  
Response to 3 balls on EB
In this instance, you simply need to hit one of the balls on the east boundary - from either A baulk or B baulk, depending on length and available targets.
Response to 3 balls in-court
A supershot opening with lags by red and black essentially forces yellow to shoot at the closest ball.  A very black and white opening, good break prospects for both players on turn 4 or 5, depending on whether yellow hits or misses.  Often times, black will have take a gentle lag while attempting a roquet at either blue or red on turn 3, so this may also give yellow some target to shoot at on turn 4.

Conclusion
If you have gotten to the bottom of this article, you have probably realised by now that the number of opening options are vast.  This article could not hope to cover every eventuality, and nor does it present any new or unseen openings; rather it serves to talk through the options and thought processes for choosing a particular option, and I hope it has been useful.

Openings

        The opening is the battle between the two sides to be the first to gain
        the upper hand. Generally when we talk about openings in croquet, we are
        referring to the first 4 turns. At the very top level it is where games
        are won and lost, but at all levels it provides a fascinating array of
        options for bluffing and double-bluffing your opponent.
      
Opening priorities
As the stronger player

        The stronger player who is playing a dangerous but less experienced /
        weaker player will generally approach the opening with the intent of not
        giving away an easy break, and hence a more defensive mindset. Openings
        where there is a lot of grey area, balls on boundaries and in corners
        are best for this. The stronger player will generally rely on their
        better all-round game in order to win, and is more comfortable with
        digging balls out slowly into a break.
      
As the weaker player

        The weaker player should approach a game against a much stronger
        opponent with an attacking mindset - they will not be afraid to take on
        relatively short shots that give laid breaks, even if it means conceding
        a laid break if they miss. The weaker player should favour openings that
        have balls in-lawn and should be looking to put pressure on the stronger
        player to have to hit in.
      
Evenly-matched players

        It is quite common to see very aggressive, black and white, openings
        when two very strong players play against each other. The same is true
        for openings between evenly-matched players at lower levels, but
        generally to a lesser extent. A lot of the opening strategy depends on
        the individual mindset of the player, with some players naturally
        playing a more attacking game than others.
      

        Below are articles on various well-known (and some not-so-well-known)
        openings, which discuss options for placement of balls, and responses to
        them. For the purposes of simplicity, in the examples below, the balls
        will always be played in the following order:
      


 Blue
        

 Red
        


          Black
        


          Yellow
        


Note: there is no ball order or sequence in which the balls need to
          be added to the game in croquet - the above order is simply to keep
          things consistent for the diagrams and explanations.


        As you can probably imagine, the options in the opening are endless.
        This article attempts to talk through some of the most common options,
        and some of the most common responses to them, with the idea of
        clarifying some of the thought processes behind them.
      

The Dream Leave

        Many of the openings below will reference something known as the Dream
        Leave - this is a scenario where the third turn ball (black) has hit and
        arranged the court as follows:
      




            Black hit on turn 3 and set a dream leave
          



        Black has retrieved red from wherever it was on the court and placed it
        slightly in-lawn from the west boundary, north of peg-high, and left
        blue a rush to it from the east boundary. This leave gives no short shot
        for yellow, and any miss by yellow will give blue a good break
        opportunity.

 First
        Ball Options
      

East Boundary

          The most common option selected by the first ball player. A ball to
          the east boundary, somewhere between level with H4 and H5, is chosen
          due to its relative distance from both baulk lines and from H1. It is
          a completely non-threatening ball and allows the second ball player to
          dictate the nature of the game, be it defensive or aggressive.
        
In-lawn East Boundary ball

          A variation on the standard east boundary ball, the in-lawn east
          boundary ball is struck out in the same area as the standard east
          boundary ball, but purposefully left about 1 yard in from the yardline
          area. The idea behind that is so that black can play its third turn
          shot out behind blue and leave itself a rush in-court. This play
          discourages responses like a west boundary tice from red.
        
Supershot

          A supershot ball is a first-turn ball placed near the middle of the
          court, normally between H5 and peg and a couple of yards west of the
          centre line. This is the most aggressive sensible option for the first
          ball, and signals your intent to your opponent that you want no grey
          area. Given its proximity to H1, a supershot ball generally gives a
          good chance for a break for either player, depending on whether the
          third-turn, fourth-turn or fifth-turn shots are hit.
        

          There are variations on the length of the supershot, with a supershot
          played to near the peg being a poorer pioneer for H1 but having the
          advantage of lengthening any fourth-turn shot by yellow at it.
        
Anti-duffer

          This opening is an attempt to try and pre-empt the second-turn
          response and discourage a "duffer tice" by red. To lay an anti-duffer,
          you hit blue to a spot somewhere between H6 and the peg, and 1-2 yards
          west of the east boundary. The idea of placing a ball here is that if
          the opponent were to lay a duffer tice with red,
          then it gives black a good chance to hit red and take off behind blue
          for a rush to H1 on turn 3. It is a leave that is generally only used
          by strong players who have a realistic chance of a third-turn break in
          the first place.
        




              Some common first-ball scenarios
            


Unusual first-turn options

          The croquet court is a big place and so there really are endless
          options for where to place balls in the opening. Often an unusual
          option first-turn will yield good results by confusing the opponent!
        
C4 first ball

          Not often seen these days due to a preference for an east boundary
          ball 10 yards further north. A weakness of this opening is that
          shooting at partner on turn 3 and missing is liable to leave a double
          target for yellow. It also generally encourages yellow to take an
          aggressive shot on turn 4; however on a difficult lawn this opening
          can have some advantages, with any hit by yellow on turn 4 at balls in
          C4 leaving little room to promote balls into the court due to the
          close proximity to the corner.
        
C2 first ball

          Playing blue into C2 first turn can often catch the opponent off
          guard. This opening attempts to flip the tables on red and yellow by
          trying to ensure a defensive opening for blue and black. This can be a
          good option where blue and black are the stronger players and want to
          prevent aggressive second-turn options by red and yellow. Of course,
          there are options available to red and yellow which negate blue and
          black's defensive preferences.
        
Micro tice

          As unusual options go, this is right up there. This option would not
          be recommended when playing a strong player, but nevertheless is very
          interesting. The micro tice is a ball played from the end of A baulk
          towards the east boundary, but only 2-3 yards towards it, leaving a
          2-3 yard roquet for the opponent on the second turn. This length of
          shot cannot really be refused, but leaving red a croquet stroke from
          south-west of hoop 4 on the second turn of the game gives no real
          break prospects. Often the second turn player will attempt an approach
          to H1 and fail it, leaving a 6-yard roquet with two balls near H1 for
          black. This opening relies more on a tactical mistake from red than
          anything else
        
C1 / C3 opening

          Occasionally seen. Not a good opening against any experienced
          opponent, but occasionally yields results. This first-turn option is
          not to be recommended. A first-turn ball in C1 followed by a
          second-turn response to C3 (or vice versa) is a killer blow to black's
          turn.
        
Back to top




 Second
        Ball Options
      


          This is where things start to get a little interesting. For the most
          part, the opening is dictated by the second ball response, and there
          are many more options available.
        
Response to East Boundary ball
Standard Tice

          The standard tice is one of the most popular responses to an east
          boundary ball at club-level croquet. Although in recent years it has
          fallen out of favour with top players (likely due to an increase in
          the standard of shooting), it is still a great opening that gives good
          chances to both sides.
        

          The standard tice is where red is played to the west boundary, and the
          distance it is placed north of C1 needs to be carefully considered by
          the striker or red. The name "tice" indicates that the distance should
          be enticing for the player of black to shoot at and so a distance of
          between about 8 and 13 yards is common. As a general rule, if possible
          the distance chosen should either be about 1 yard longer than the
          opponent's critical distance (the distance at which someone hits 50%
          of their shots) or 1 yard shorter (or equal to) your own critical
          distance. Obviously this cannot be achieved if your opponent has a
          longer critical distance than you do, so it is better to err slightly
          on the longer side.
        

          If blue is an in-lawn east boundary ball, laying a standard tice is
          risky, as black can quite easily lay a rush directly to it on the
          third turn.
        
C2 ball

          Probably the most common response to the east boundary ball today is
          the second-turn ball to 6" south of C2. The reason for playing just
          south of C2 is that if in the unlikely event of black shooting at red
          on turn 3, a miss will likely leave yellow a double target. The idea
          of red near C2 means that red is buried in a defensive position, and
          signals yellow's intent to shoot at blue and black on turn 4.
        

          If blue is slightly in-lawn, then C2 is the safest and most defensive
          response with red.
        
Duffer tice

          One of the more aggressive responses for red is the duffer tice. This
          is a ball that is placed usually about 2-feet north and a few inches
          east of penultimate. This is similarly enticing for the opponent to
          shoot (just as with a standard tice) but in this case a miss is
          usually more critical - any third turn shot at the duffer is in the
          direction of A baulk so black usually takes the shot gently - and by
          doing so is more likely to miss. Black missing leaves two balls in the
          centre of the court, giving yellow a great chance on turn 4. The
          duffer tice is a great option for weaker players playing against
          stronger players, and also for anyone confident in hitting 10 yarders.
        

          Between two very strong players a duffer tice is still a popular
          opening. There are variations on the placement of the ball near
          penult, based on the strength of the opponent. It is common to see a
          duffer tice placed level with, or south of, H6, particularly if the
          striker of red and yellow is a very good shot and is confident to hit
          an 11-yarder on turn 4. In a game between experts, the placement of
          red is sometimes moved to the west of H6 to discourage a third-turn
          break after a hit from black at blue.
        
C4 ball

          This option is very popular in New Zealand and although a mirror image
          of the C2 ball, is a lot more aggressive. Placing red 6" north of C4
          not only gives negligible break prospects to black on turn 3 but also
          signals your intent to hit fourth-turn with yellow and have a break. A
          miss at partner by black on turn 3 gives you a 13-yard shot for a
          4-ball break, and a miss by black at red on turn 3 usually gives a
          double target.
        
Shoot at first-turn ball

          A slightly counter-intuitive option but nonetheless an interesting
          one. Shooting red at blue on turn 2 and hitting gives no break
          prospects, but a miss also leaves very slim break prospects for black
          on turn 3 if it hits, unless black is a very strong player. With this
          opening it is quite common to see misses on both turns 2 and 3, and
          often a triple target for yellow at the other 3 balls on turn 4 from B
          baulk.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to east boundary opening
            


Response to Supershot ball

          The supershot ball is the most aggressive opening that the first-turn
          player can use. There are several responses to this which need to be
          considered, based on your assessment of your opponent's ability and
          whether the opponent has realistic prospects of a break to 4-back if
          they do manage to hit 3rd turn.
        
C2 response

          The C2 response is a ball played about 6" south of C2. This is a
          strong response to a supershot against almost all players. If the
          player of black wants to attempt a third-turn break, they will have to
          hit a 13-yarder and play a very difficult croquet stroke out of C2 to
          get a rush to H1, and this is by no means guaranteed. On the other
          hand, a miss by black at red on turn 3 will leave yellow a double
          target and a 4-ball break if hit.
        




              It is important to finish a few inches south of C2 with red as it
              will mean black missing on either side of it will leave a double
              target. Above is a comparison of yellow's target after a
              third-turn miss by black at red, firstly with red in C2 and
              secondly with red a few inches south of C2
            



          There are only a handful of players in the world where the C2 ball is
          not a great response - players who would expect to hit the 13 yarder
          most of the time and also be good enough at croquet strokes to expect
          to get a rush to H1 on the supershot ball. Against these players the
          strategy of lengthing the 3rd turn shot would be preferred.
        
C4 response

          Mirror image to the C2 response, this ball is played 6" north of C4.
          Consider this if blue (the supershot ball) is placed further north
          than normal (somewhere near peg-high), or is in a particular spot
          which may have H4 obscuring any croquet stroke from C4 towards it. It
          otherwise gives all the same advantages as the C2 response
        
Max Distance response

          As a counter to the very top players hitting the ball in C2 most of
          the time, the max distance response became popular - this is where red
          is played to the east boundary about level with the peg on the east
          boundary, leaving the longest shot possible for black. This response
          grants black a shot from C3 through red and into C4, reducing yellow's
          fourth-turn prospects - it relies more on black missing red than
          trying to make any break pick-up by black more difficult. Generally a
          good option against the very best players, but against most players is
          unnecessary.  
The reason why max distance on the east boundary is chosen instead of the equivalent max distance spot on the west boundary is that it is slightly further from the supershot ball (blue), which is slightly south-west of the peg.  Assuming that the shots on turns 3 and 4 are missed, blue's shot at red & yellow on the east boundary will be a couple of yards longer than the equivalent shot to the west boundary.  
Supershot lag

          The response for red to lag to a spot 3-4 yards east and 1-2 yards
          north of the supershot ball is a very strong and very under-used
          response to the supershot. This is a good tactic when playing someone
          who is a very good shot, and in particular if the supershot ball
          itself is quite deep (nearer the peg than H5). Placing red beside blue
          nullifies the strength of black's shooting by encouraging black to
          take its third turn shot gently (which is generally less accurate), or
          risk shooting hard and missing into B baulk, conceding a 4-ball break.
          In this case, black may choose not to shoot at all, and instead also
          lag to a position wide of the other two balls, meaning that red and
          yellow have successfully turned the tables of the supershot opening
          and enabled yellow to have the first attempted roquet.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to supershot opening
            


Roquet the Supershot ball

          The ultimate way to nullify the supershot ball - roquet it on the
          second turn. After roqueting blue with red, there are several options
          available. You can croquet blue towards C2 and then fire red off 6"
          north of C4. A more aggressive option would be to croquet blue
          north-west of H2 and fire red off the south boundary, south of H4 -
          this leaves black a choice of 7-8 yarders but minimal break prospects
          and difficult strokes with their third turn in order to distance the
          balls from baulk. A more novel option would be to crosswire blue and
          red at the peg, which leaves only a 17-yard shot for black with a
          baulk line in the background. An even more interesting option might be
          to roll blue close to the peg, either east or west, and then play red
          a yard or two away from it, wiring blue's backswing at red. This means
          that black probably has no lag option towards blue that doesn't leave
          a double-target for yellow.
        
Response to unusual first-turn options
Response to a first-turn C2 ball

          A first-turn C2 ball is an attempt by blue to make red conform to a
          defensive opening. Red could of course do this if it wants, by playing
          6" north of C4, or even by just having a "standard" east boundary
          ball; however a better option to negate blue's attempt at dictating
          the opening might be to set a duffer tice - this is the ultimate
          aggressive response to the C2 ball, and means that black is suddenly
          faced with having to hit a 10-13 yarder on turn 3 or risk leaving the
          same for yellow next turn, and a laid break.

 Third
        Ball Options
      

        For the vast majority of players, if they manage to hit in on the third
        turn of the game, they will and should be looking to make a dream leave
        (see top of page) or similar, possibly with red near the peg and blue &
        black with a rush towards it. There are exceptions to this line of play,
        mainly with supershot openings, but unless otherwise stated, the
        standard play would be to try and set a dream leave.
      

Response to WB tice after EB opening

          Realistically, black will not be attempting to make any break on turn
          3 if it manages to hit in. The player of black has to make a judgement
          call on their likelihood of hitting the standard tice vs their
          opponent's likelihood of missing it.
        


            If the tice is long, the best response is probably to shoot black at
            blue from A baulk. Missing black at blue leaves the free shot at the
            tice for yellow of course, which does give yellow fairly good
            prospects if hit. If the tice is extremely long, say peg-high, then
            black could quite feasibly just lag at blue and attempt to leave a
            rush to red. Bear in mind that playing this lag so early in the game
            may be difficult as you may not have the pace of the court - and
            there is a risk that lagging at blue and falling short will leave
            yellow a double target on turn 4.
          

            Another option if black is uncertain, would be to shoot at blue from
            C3, and missing through to C4. This hedges black's bets somewhat, as
            it is still taking a shot at a ball and still somewhat joining with
            partner ball, but does not give good break prospects to the opponent
            if yellow hits, due to the proximity of blue and black to one
            another. Yellow is faced with a long takeoff from red towards blue
            and black and in all likelihood will not get a rush to H1 from this
            position.
          

            The third option is of course to shoot at the tice itself. Hitting
            red will give the opportunity to make a dream leave (as shown at the
            top of the page). Missing red will send black towards C2, which will
            give black a free shot back through red and yellow if yellow misses
            its fourth-turn shot at red.
          





              Some common third-ball responses to a standard tice
            


Response to C2 ball after EB opening

          There are two common options after a second-turn C2 ball - both
          consist of shooting at partner. If partner is hit, then usually the
          play will be to take off to the red in C2, roquet it and then croquet
          it either into the centre of the court, or along the west boundary,
          then lag back to partner and leave a rush in-court. However, consider
          a game where you are the stronger player playing a very capable weaker
          player, if you do hit partner third turn, you can elect to just set a
          rush to the C2 ball instead of trying to retrieve it from C2. As the
          stronger player you may prefer this line of play, instead of digging
          out the C2 ball only for your opponent to hit on turn 4 and have an
          easy break.
        

          Usually the third-turn shot at partner with black will be from A
          baulk, joining up on the east boundary if missed. This leaves a long
          double target for yellow from the end of B baulk. A more defensive
          play would be to shoot at partner from C3 into C4. Doing this leaves
          almost no break prospects fourth-turn for yellow but, depending on the
          distance between blue and black, may give them the opportunity to join
          up.
        

          Another option for black on turn 3 would be to shoot at red in C2 -
          however usually this is only a viable option if red is exactly in the
          corner, as it will mean that missing red on the right leaves no double
          target for yellow. Alternatively, another option would be for black to
          join up with red near C2, about 3-4 feet south of it. Doing so leaves
          no double target from B baulk and gives good break prospects to black
          if yellow misses the 13 yarder, although it must be remembered that
          yellow also has good prospects if it hits the 13 yarder. Black joining
          up with red also leaves a defensive shot for yellow at blue from C3 to
          C4 which, if missed, leaves black a very long and tricky takeoff from
          C2 to the east boundary.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a C2 ball
            


Response to C2 / C4 ball after Supershot opening

          The third-turn response to this option depends greatly on your ability
          and also the ability of your opponent. Before you lay the supershot,
          you need to ask yourself "am I realistically good enough to play a
          third-turn break to 4-back?". If the answer is no, then that does not
          mean that the supershot opening is a bad idea at all, but it just
          means that you may want to reassess your third-turn response.
          Additionally, if you are playing someone that you believe is much
          better than you are, then trying to give yourself a 4-ball break on
          turn 5 is exactly what you should be trying to achieve. Therefore,
          instead of trying to roquet the 13 yard shot of black at red just
          south of C2 (or just north of C4), you can instead look to join up
          with the ball 3-4 feet away, ensuring to leave no double target. This
          puts a great deal of pressure on your stronger opponent to then hit a
          13 yarder or else concede a 4-ball break to you.
        

          If you believe you are good enough to hit on turn 3 and play a break,
          then the answer is simple - hit red near C2 and go round.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / C2 ball
            


Response to EB ball after Supershot opening

          In most cases, the third-turn response to a max distance ball is to
          try and hit it from C3, missing into C4. Again, however, you should
          evaluate your own likelihood of playing a break to 4-back with only 3
          balls on the lawn if you hit, and so you may want to consider lagging
          to the ball, a couple of yards in-lawn from the east boundary.
        

          If the ball on the east boundary is south of the peg, it is tempting
          to simply shoot at it from A baulk. Missing will of course leave a
          double from B baulk, but the odds of yellow then hitting a double
          target from 20+ yards is no certainty. Alternatively, if the
          second-turn ball is around peg-high, then shooting at it from B baulk
          from a few yards west of C3 and missing often results in a fairly even
          spread of the balls, with your black ball being approximately 8 yards
          south of red and 8 yards north of C4. This again is technically a
          double target from somewhere on B Baulk, but given the distance
          between red and black, is easily missed and will leave your black ball
          a shot of only 8 yards.

              ball
            


Response to C4 ball after EB opening

          This opening creates one of the more interesting third-turn decisions.
          A second-turn ball 6" north of C4 is a very threatening position and
          therefore the options will as follows:
        


            Shoot at partner
            
Hit - set a dream leave

                Miss - leaves yellow a 13-yard shot at red in C4 for a 4-ball
                break
              



            Shoot at opponent near C4 from A baulk
            

                Hit - set a dream leave (you may want to have a go at gaining a
                rush to H1 on partner)
              

                Miss - leave a 13-yard double for yellow (but slightly tricky
                break pick-up)
              



            Join up with opponent near C4, leaving no double
            

                If red is 3-6" north of C4 - join a yard north of it from A
                baulk
                
No short double target is left for yellow

                    Yellow still only has a 13-yard shot for the innings (but a
                    slightly tricky break pick-up)
                  



                If red is ~12" north of C4 - shoot from C3 through to C4
                

                    Enables black to have a shot (albeit very long) to attempt
                    to hit and set a dream leave
                  




Black to C2


              By burying itself in C2, this enables black to kill off the
              aggression by red and yellow. Any miss by yellow will leave a 9
              yarder (at most) for blue
            






              Some common third-ball responses to a C4 ball
            



          A personal preference of mine is to shoot third-turn at the ball near
          C4 from A baulk, because hitting gives me control of the court, and I
          miss often enough by more than several inches so as not to leave a
          double.
        

          Be on the lookout for cannons around C4 as part of this opening -
          there is often a good opportunity to bombard a live ball across to H1
          while playing a croquet stroke towards blue on the east boundary. This
          can make picking up the first break a great deal easier.
        
Response to duffer tice after EB opening

          The duffer tice is one of my favourite openings. Because of the
          placement of red near H6, a miss by black from the end of B baulk will
          be headed towards A baulk and give an easy start for yellow. That is
          why we see the ~9 yard shot at red refused so often, even by very
          strong players!
        

          If black does decide to shoot at the duffer and hits, then not a great
          deal of options are available other than to take off to partner ball
          (usually nudging red towards the peg in the process), and leave a rush
          towards red, and then hope for a fourth-turn miss by yellow.
        

          Another option for shooting at the duffer is doing so from C3,
          shooting across the court and missing to around peg-high (or just
          south of peg-high) on the west boundary. This is the most defensive
          shot available in that a miss gives no break to yellow if yellow hits
          red, but it also does not put any pressure on yellow's shot at red.
          Often times, when black misses the shot from C3 at red, it will end up
          south of peg-high on the west boundary and be a tempting free shot for
          yellow from C1.
        

          Shooting at partner ball on turn 3 is the most aggressive line of play
          - taking the shot from A baulk and hitting gives the opportunity to
          play a big croquet stroke loading partner to H2 and attempting to get
          a rush to H1 on the duffer ball - it is a big shot and the break
          chances are normally only reasonable for very strong players. Missing
          partner from A baulk on the other hand gives yellow a ~9 yard shot and
          very strong break prospects. It is therefore more usual to see black
          shoot at blue from C3 which, although longer, doesn't make all the
          balls available to yellow if black misses blue and yellow hits red. It
          also means that blue and black maintain a wide join and have realistic
          prospects of hitting back in if yellow misses red.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a duffer tice
            


Response to 2 balls on EB

          If red has shot at blue on turn 2 and missed, leaving both balls on
          the east boundary, you should carefully evaluate your response based
          on the strength of your opponent. If you and your opponent are evenly
          matched but not world class players, or especially if your opponent is
          a much stronger player than you, then the best thing to do here may be
          to simply ignore the two balls on the east boundary and lag black into
          the middle of the court and wait for yellow to miss. This potentially
          presents you with an immediate break with a ball in the middle of the
          court.
        

          In a match between two very strong players it would be unusual to see
          no shot taken on turn 3, and if hit, some attempt at digging out a
          3-ball break.
        
Response to 2 balls in-court

          In a situation where you have laid a supershot with blue, and red has
          lagged a couple of yards north east of your supershot ball, if there
          is no double target to be had from anywhere on the baulk lines, you
          must again consider your expectations after hitting third turn vs your
          opponent's likelihood of hitting fourth turn. As with previous
          options, if you are playing an opponent who on paper is a much
          stronger player, the percentage play is usually to lag the black ball
          into the middle of the court beside the other two balls (being mindful
          not to leave a double target from anywhere), which will put pressure
          on your stronger opponent to hit in or else concede the first break
          opportunity to you.
        

          If you do want to shoot with black at one of the balls in the middle,
          then consider either shooting at the easterly ball from C1 (you may
          even be able to shoot hard at this without missing to B baulk), or
          alternatively shooting at a medium pace at either blue or red from the
          closest point on A baulk. If you do shoot from the closest point, be
          sure to hit at a pace to finish slightly south of H6, both so that
          black is not a short shot from B baulk, and so that any double target
          that you leave has plenty of space between the front and back ball.
        

          If you are facing a third turn shot with black after red has
          cross-wired blue and red at the peg, check first to see if there is a
          point which you can lag to where blue won't be wired from black, and
          which won't be giving a double target from either baulk line - if
          there is such a spot, then that is the best place to lag to.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to supershot lag
            


Back to top



 Fourth Ball Options
      

The fourth-turn response is usually actually more simple than then third-turn response - although there are more possible scenarios, they almost always result in yellow trying to roquet something.  
      

Response to ignored WB tice
When black has ignored a standard west boundary tice and insetad shot at (and missed) partner on the east boundary, the obvious response is to then try and hit red yourself from C1.  If the placement of red is good, you should have ~50% chance of hitting in.  Your break prospects after hitting red are actually quite good, as you will play a take off from red to blue & black, which will automatically be sending red towards H2 as a pioneer.  On the other hand, a miss with yellow through red into C2 only gives fairly mediocre break prospects to blue & black in the next turn.
Response to missed WB tice
If black did indeed shoot at red (and miss) from C1 in the previous turn, then the obvious response is to shoot at red yourself, but from a point east of C1 so that a miss will leave yellow joined with red.  If you hit red, your best line of play would be to roll red &  yellow towards C1 and lay a rush for your next turn.  A miss from red at yellow will of course leave black a shot through red and yellow from C2 to C1 but is likely to be a very long shot at a single ball target.  A miss from black on turn 5 here also gives you a good chance at establishing a break on turn 5.  




              If black has missed the standard tice, it leaves a good opportunity to join up with red on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C2 ball after EB opening
Having played red into C2 on turn 2, if black ignores red and simply joins with blue (which is likely), then against most players your best line of play would be to shoot at blue and black with red.  Whether you shoot from A baulk or B baulk depends on factors such as the distance between blue and black (whether it is easy to make a double target from B baulk or A baulk) and the flatness of the east boundary.  If the black ball missed blue badly on the left on turn 3, blue and black may well be 2+ yards apart on the east boundary, so there is a defensive option available to yellow as well - shoot from C3 through to C4, where a miss would not give blue & black any easy opening.
If you are the weaker player against a very strong opponent, then there is a case for shooting yellow at red - at 13 yards, it is significantly shorter than any other available shot and is therefore your best chance at winning the opening.  Red missing yellow gives blue a relatively easy start and a probable break, but against a very strong opponent it can still be worth the risk.  




              Fourth-turn responses for yellow when partner is in C2 and opponent balls are on the east boundary.  
            


Response to joined / missed C2 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, if black has for some reason shot at red in C2, then assuming a double target has been left, your best aggressive option is to shoot at this, preferably hitting the northern ball, from B baulk.  A hit or a miss here will give fairly good break prospects to whomever plays the next shot, given C2's proximity to H2 - a semi-good pioneer can usually be sent to H2 while obtaining a rush to H1.
If black has instead joined up a yard south of red on turn 2, you have no double target (except from C1, but let's not consider that).  Now you have fundamentally two options - either shoot yellow at red which will give a good break opportunity if hit (and concede a good break opportunity to black if missed), or take a more defensive line by shooting yellow at blue from C3 into C4.  If yellow misses this shot, it does give black a 1-yard roquet at red for the innings, however it not only gives no break prospects, but also requires black to play several good strokes in order to have a good leave.  Black's take off from C2 to blue on the east boundary is a difficult shot, and if black doesn't succeed in roqueting blue in its next shot (either taking off short and missing blue, or taking off too far and sending black out) then yellow will have a 9-10 yard shot at blue & black from near C4.




              If black has joined a yard south of red near C2, the yellow has aggressive and defensive options available
            


Response to missed EB ball after Supershot opening
The response here depends a lot on both the length of the supershot ball and what option black chose on turn 3.  Firstly let's assume the most common scenario, with blue halfway between H5 and peg, and 1-2 yards west of the centre line, and red approximately peg high on the EB, and black in or near C4.  In this situation the best option is normally to shoot at red from A baulk, with a miss joining up around 1 yard north of it.  This leaves blue a 15-yarder at red & yellow but difficult break prospects for both players, whomever plays the next shot. 




              The common response after a third-turn miss by black at red to C4, is for yellow to shoot at red, joining if missing.  An aggressive line is to shoot at black.  A third option is yellow at blue, which is shorter and will win you the innings, but only gives good break prospects if red and black are near to each other
            


As the weaker player against a stronger player, a very aggressive line of play would be to shoot yellow from A baulk at black in C4 - this is very black and white, as a hit will give you a good chance for a 4-ball break and a miss will give black the same chance.  As the weaker player, you can strongly consider this option.  
Consider for a moment that black's third-turn shot missed red from A baulk, or perhaps missed red from west of C3, finishing 5-10 yards south of red.  In this case, yellow for look for possible double targets available from B baulk.  Consider, too, the shortest shot available, which is yellow at blue from A baulk - this is likely a 11-13 yard shot which, if hit, gives good break prospects to yellow because red and black are close together.
Response to ignored duffer tice
The vast majority of the time the best response to black ignoring red's duffer tice, is for yellow to shoot hard at red from B baulk.  Usually a duffer tice is only 9-10 yards and so it will be, by far, the shortest shot for yellow.




              The majority of the time, the fourth turn response would be to shoot yellow at the duffer.  Against a very strong player, you might be tempted by yellow at black in C4 which, although 3 yards longer, gives an easy start to your break
            


An expection to this would be if blue & black are joined on the east boundary leaving a good double target from A baulk, and so you may want to consider shooting at that instead.  Another option to consider is if black shot and missed blue from C3 to C4.  If you are playing against a much stronger opponent you may consider shooting yellow at black from A baulk into C4.  This shot is 3 yards longer than yellow at red from B baulk, but hitting this shot gives you vastly stronger break prospects than if you hit red first.
Response to missed duffer tice
If black misses the duffer tice (red) gently, the logical response is to shoot hard at either red from B baulk or black from A baulk (whichever is closer).  If black misses the duffer tice from C3 across to the west boundary, you may consider shooting at black from C1 through to C2, particularly if black is south of peg-high.  




              If the duffer tice is still in its original position at the start of turn 4, the general response is for yellow to shoot at red given its proximity to B baulk.  If black missed red from C3 however, it can be tempting to shoot at black from C1 on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C4 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, red a few inches north of C4 and black 1 yard north of blue, yellow's default response should be to shoot at red from A baulk.  Hitting this shot gives a great break opportunity, as it is a very natural stroke to croquet red to H2 while approaching blue & black up the east boundary.  
Response to 3 balls on EB
In this instance, you simply need to hit one of the balls on the east boundary - from either A baulk or B baulk, depending on length and available targets.
Response to 3 balls in-court
A supershot opening with lags by red and black essentially forces yellow to shoot at the closest ball.  A very black and white opening, good break prospects for both players on turn 4 or 5, depending on whether yellow hits or misses.  Often times, black will have take a gentle lag while attempting a roquet at either blue or red on turn 3, so this may also give yellow some target to shoot at on turn 4.

Conclusion
If you have gotten to the bottom of this article, you have probably realised by now that the number of opening options are vast.  This article could not hope to cover every eventuality, and nor does it present any new or unseen openings; rather it serves to talk through the options and thought processes for choosing a particular option, and I hope it has been useful.

Openings

        The opening is the battle between the two sides to be the first to gain
        the upper hand. Generally when we talk about openings in croquet, we are
        referring to the first 4 turns. At the very top level it is where games
        are won and lost, but at all levels it provides a fascinating array of
        options for bluffing and double-bluffing your opponent.
      
Opening priorities
As the stronger player

        The stronger player who is playing a dangerous but less experienced /
        weaker player will generally approach the opening with the intent of not
        giving away an easy break, and hence a more defensive mindset. Openings
        where there is a lot of grey area, balls on boundaries and in corners
        are best for this. The stronger player will generally rely on their
        better all-round game in order to win, and is more comfortable with
        digging balls out slowly into a break.
      
As the weaker player

        The weaker player should approach a game against a much stronger
        opponent with an attacking mindset - they will not be afraid to take on
        relatively short shots that give laid breaks, even if it means conceding
        a laid break if they miss. The weaker player should favour openings that
        have balls in-lawn and should be looking to put pressure on the stronger
        player to have to hit in.
      
Evenly-matched players

        It is quite common to see very aggressive, black and white, openings
        when two very strong players play against each other. The same is true
        for openings between evenly-matched players at lower levels, but
        generally to a lesser extent. A lot of the opening strategy depends on
        the individual mindset of the player, with some players naturally
        playing a more attacking game than others.
      

        Below are articles on various well-known (and some not-so-well-known)
        openings, which discuss options for placement of balls, and responses to
        them. For the purposes of simplicity, in the examples below, the balls
        will always be played in the following order:
      


 Blue
        

 Red
        


          Black
        


          Yellow
        


Note: there is no ball order or sequence in which the balls need to
          be added to the game in croquet - the above order is simply to keep
          things consistent for the diagrams and explanations.


        As you can probably imagine, the options in the opening are endless.
        This article attempts to talk through some of the most common options,
        and some of the most common responses to them, with the idea of
        clarifying some of the thought processes behind them.
      

The Dream Leave

        Many of the openings below will reference something known as the Dream
        Leave - this is a scenario where the third turn ball (black) has hit and
        arranged the court as follows:
      




            Black hit on turn 3 and set a dream leave
          



        Black has retrieved red from wherever it was on the court and placed it
        slightly in-lawn from the west boundary, north of peg-high, and left
        blue a rush to it from the east boundary. This leave gives no short shot
        for yellow, and any miss by yellow will give blue a good break
        opportunity.

 First
        Ball Options
      

East Boundary

          The most common option selected by the first ball player. A ball to
          the east boundary, somewhere between level with H4 and H5, is chosen
          due to its relative distance from both baulk lines and from H1. It is
          a completely non-threatening ball and allows the second ball player to
          dictate the nature of the game, be it defensive or aggressive.
        
In-lawn East Boundary ball

          A variation on the standard east boundary ball, the in-lawn east
          boundary ball is struck out in the same area as the standard east
          boundary ball, but purposefully left about 1 yard in from the yardline
          area. The idea behind that is so that black can play its third turn
          shot out behind blue and leave itself a rush in-court. This play
          discourages responses like a west boundary tice from red.
        
Supershot

          A supershot ball is a first-turn ball placed near the middle of the
          court, normally between H5 and peg and a couple of yards west of the
          centre line. This is the most aggressive sensible option for the first
          ball, and signals your intent to your opponent that you want no grey
          area. Given its proximity to H1, a supershot ball generally gives a
          good chance for a break for either player, depending on whether the
          third-turn, fourth-turn or fifth-turn shots are hit.
        

          There are variations on the length of the supershot, with a supershot
          played to near the peg being a poorer pioneer for H1 but having the
          advantage of lengthening any fourth-turn shot by yellow at it.
        
Anti-duffer

          This opening is an attempt to try and pre-empt the second-turn
          response and discourage a "duffer tice" by red. To lay an anti-duffer,
          you hit blue to a spot somewhere between H6 and the peg, and 1-2 yards
          west of the east boundary. The idea of placing a ball here is that if
          the opponent were to lay a duffer tice with red,
          then it gives black a good chance to hit red and take off behind blue
          for a rush to H1 on turn 3. It is a leave that is generally only used
          by strong players who have a realistic chance of a third-turn break in
          the first place.
        




              Some common first-ball scenarios
            


Unusual first-turn options

          The croquet court is a big place and so there really are endless
          options for where to place balls in the opening. Often an unusual
          option first-turn will yield good results by confusing the opponent!
        
C4 first ball

          Not often seen these days due to a preference for an east boundary
          ball 10 yards further north. A weakness of this opening is that
          shooting at partner on turn 3 and missing is liable to leave a double
          target for yellow. It also generally encourages yellow to take an
          aggressive shot on turn 4; however on a difficult lawn this opening
          can have some advantages, with any hit by yellow on turn 4 at balls in
          C4 leaving little room to promote balls into the court due to the
          close proximity to the corner.
        
C2 first ball

          Playing blue into C2 first turn can often catch the opponent off
          guard. This opening attempts to flip the tables on red and yellow by
          trying to ensure a defensive opening for blue and black. This can be a
          good option where blue and black are the stronger players and want to
          prevent aggressive second-turn options by red and yellow. Of course,
          there are options available to red and yellow which negate blue and
          black's defensive preferences.
        
Micro tice

          As unusual options go, this is right up there. This option would not
          be recommended when playing a strong player, but nevertheless is very
          interesting. The micro tice is a ball played from the end of A baulk
          towards the east boundary, but only 2-3 yards towards it, leaving a
          2-3 yard roquet for the opponent on the second turn. This length of
          shot cannot really be refused, but leaving red a croquet stroke from
          south-west of hoop 4 on the second turn of the game gives no real
          break prospects. Often the second turn player will attempt an approach
          to H1 and fail it, leaving a 6-yard roquet with two balls near H1 for
          black. This opening relies more on a tactical mistake from red than
          anything else
        
C1 / C3 opening

          Occasionally seen. Not a good opening against any experienced
          opponent, but occasionally yields results. This first-turn option is
          not to be recommended. A first-turn ball in C1 followed by a
          second-turn response to C3 (or vice versa) is a killer blow to black's
          turn.

 Second
        Ball Options
      


          This is where things start to get a little interesting. For the most
          part, the opening is dictated by the second ball response, and there
          are many more options available.
        
Response to East Boundary ball
Standard Tice

          The standard tice is one of the most popular responses to an east
          boundary ball at club-level croquet. Although in recent years it has
          fallen out of favour with top players (likely due to an increase in
          the standard of shooting), it is still a great opening that gives good
          chances to both sides.
        

          The standard tice is where red is played to the west boundary, and the
          distance it is placed north of C1 needs to be carefully considered by
          the striker or red. The name "tice" indicates that the distance should
          be enticing for the player of black to shoot at and so a distance of
          between about 8 and 13 yards is common. As a general rule, if possible
          the distance chosen should either be about 1 yard longer than the
          opponent's critical distance (the distance at which someone hits 50%
          of their shots) or 1 yard shorter (or equal to) your own critical
          distance. Obviously this cannot be achieved if your opponent has a
          longer critical distance than you do, so it is better to err slightly
          on the longer side.
        

          If blue is an in-lawn east boundary ball, laying a standard tice is
          risky, as black can quite easily lay a rush directly to it on the
          third turn.
        
C2 ball

          Probably the most common response to the east boundary ball today is
          the second-turn ball to 6" south of C2. The reason for playing just
          south of C2 is that if in the unlikely event of black shooting at red
          on turn 3, a miss will likely leave yellow a double target. The idea
          of red near C2 means that red is buried in a defensive position, and
          signals yellow's intent to shoot at blue and black on turn 4.
        

          If blue is slightly in-lawn, then C2 is the safest and most defensive
          response with red.
        
Duffer tice

          One of the more aggressive responses for red is the duffer tice. This
          is a ball that is placed usually about 2-feet north and a few inches
          east of penultimate. This is similarly enticing for the opponent to
          shoot (just as with a standard tice) but in this case a miss is
          usually more critical - any third turn shot at the duffer is in the
          direction of A baulk so black usually takes the shot gently - and by
          doing so is more likely to miss. Black missing leaves two balls in the
          centre of the court, giving yellow a great chance on turn 4. The
          duffer tice is a great option for weaker players playing against
          stronger players, and also for anyone confident in hitting 10 yarders.
        

          Between two very strong players a duffer tice is still a popular
          opening. There are variations on the placement of the ball near
          penult, based on the strength of the opponent. It is common to see a
          duffer tice placed level with, or south of, H6, particularly if the
          striker of red and yellow is a very good shot and is confident to hit
          an 11-yarder on turn 4. In a game between experts, the placement of
          red is sometimes moved to the west of H6 to discourage a third-turn
          break after a hit from black at blue.
        
C4 ball

          This option is very popular in New Zealand and although a mirror image
          of the C2 ball, is a lot more aggressive. Placing red 6" north of C4
          not only gives negligible break prospects to black on turn 3 but also
          signals your intent to hit fourth-turn with yellow and have a break. A
          miss at partner by black on turn 3 gives you a 13-yard shot for a
          4-ball break, and a miss by black at red on turn 3 usually gives a
          double target.
        
Shoot at first-turn ball

          A slightly counter-intuitive option but nonetheless an interesting
          one. Shooting red at blue on turn 2 and hitting gives no break
          prospects, but a miss also leaves very slim break prospects for black
          on turn 3 if it hits, unless black is a very strong player. With this
          opening it is quite common to see misses on both turns 2 and 3, and
          often a triple target for yellow at the other 3 balls on turn 4 from B
          baulk.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to east boundary opening
            


Response to Supershot ball

          The supershot ball is the most aggressive opening that the first-turn
          player can use. There are several responses to this which need to be
          considered, based on your assessment of your opponent's ability and
          whether the opponent has realistic prospects of a break to 4-back if
          they do manage to hit 3rd turn.
        
C2 response

          The C2 response is a ball played about 6" south of C2. This is a
          strong response to a supershot against almost all players. If the
          player of black wants to attempt a third-turn break, they will have to
          hit a 13-yarder and play a very difficult croquet stroke out of C2 to
          get a rush to H1, and this is by no means guaranteed. On the other
          hand, a miss by black at red on turn 3 will leave yellow a double
          target and a 4-ball break if hit.
        




              It is important to finish a few inches south of C2 with red as it
              will mean black missing on either side of it will leave a double
              target. Above is a comparison of yellow's target after a
              third-turn miss by black at red, firstly with red in C2 and
              secondly with red a few inches south of C2
            



          There are only a handful of players in the world where the C2 ball is
          not a great response - players who would expect to hit the 13 yarder
          most of the time and also be good enough at croquet strokes to expect
          to get a rush to H1 on the supershot ball. Against these players the
          strategy of lengthing the 3rd turn shot would be preferred.
        
C4 response

          Mirror image to the C2 response, this ball is played 6" north of C4.
          Consider this if blue (the supershot ball) is placed further north
          than normal (somewhere near peg-high), or is in a particular spot
          which may have H4 obscuring any croquet stroke from C4 towards it. It
          otherwise gives all the same advantages as the C2 response
        
Max Distance response

          As a counter to the very top players hitting the ball in C2 most of
          the time, the max distance response became popular - this is where red
          is played to the east boundary about level with the peg on the east
          boundary, leaving the longest shot possible for black. This response
          grants black a shot from C3 through red and into C4, reducing yellow's
          fourth-turn prospects - it relies more on black missing red than
          trying to make any break pick-up by black more difficult. Generally a
          good option against the very best players, but against most players is
          unnecessary.  
The reason why max distance on the east boundary is chosen instead of the equivalent max distance spot on the west boundary is that it is slightly further from the supershot ball (blue), which is slightly south-west of the peg.  Assuming that the shots on turns 3 and 4 are missed, blue's shot at red & yellow on the east boundary will be a couple of yards longer than the equivalent shot to the west boundary.  
Supershot lag

          The response for red to lag to a spot 3-4 yards east and 1-2 yards
          north of the supershot ball is a very strong and very under-used
          response to the supershot. This is a good tactic when playing someone
          who is a very good shot, and in particular if the supershot ball
          itself is quite deep (nearer the peg than H5). Placing red beside blue
          nullifies the strength of black's shooting by encouraging black to
          take its third turn shot gently (which is generally less accurate), or
          risk shooting hard and missing into B baulk, conceding a 4-ball break.
          In this case, black may choose not to shoot at all, and instead also
          lag to a position wide of the other two balls, meaning that red and
          yellow have successfully turned the tables of the supershot opening
          and enabled yellow to have the first attempted roquet.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to supershot opening
            


Roquet the Supershot ball

          The ultimate way to nullify the supershot ball - roquet it on the
          second turn. After roqueting blue with red, there are several options
          available. You can croquet blue towards C2 and then fire red off 6"
          north of C4. A more aggressive option would be to croquet blue
          north-west of H2 and fire red off the south boundary, south of H4 -
          this leaves black a choice of 7-8 yarders but minimal break prospects
          and difficult strokes with their third turn in order to distance the
          balls from baulk. A more novel option would be to crosswire blue and
          red at the peg, which leaves only a 17-yard shot for black with a
          baulk line in the background. An even more interesting option might be
          to roll blue close to the peg, either east or west, and then play red
          a yard or two away from it, wiring blue's backswing at red. This means
          that black probably has no lag option towards blue that doesn't leave
          a double-target for yellow.
        
Response to unusual first-turn options
Response to a first-turn C2 ball

          A first-turn C2 ball is an attempt by blue to make red conform to a
          defensive opening. Red could of course do this if it wants, by playing
          6" north of C4, or even by just having a "standard" east boundary
          ball; however a better option to negate blue's attempt at dictating
          the opening might be to set a duffer tice - this is the ultimate
          aggressive response to the C2 ball, and means that black is suddenly
          faced with having to hit a 10-13 yarder on turn 3 or risk leaving the
          same for yellow next turn, and a laid break.

 Third
        Ball Options
      

        For the vast majority of players, if they manage to hit in on the third
        turn of the game, they will and should be looking to make a dream leave
        (see top of page) or similar, possibly with red near the peg and blue &
        black with a rush towards it. There are exceptions to this line of play,
        mainly with supershot openings, but unless otherwise stated, the
        standard play would be to try and set a dream leave.
      

Response to WB tice after EB opening

          Realistically, black will not be attempting to make any break on turn
          3 if it manages to hit in. The player of black has to make a judgement
          call on their likelihood of hitting the standard tice vs their
          opponent's likelihood of missing it.
        


            If the tice is long, the best response is probably to shoot black at
            blue from A baulk. Missing black at blue leaves the free shot at the
            tice for yellow of course, which does give yellow fairly good
            prospects if hit. If the tice is extremely long, say peg-high, then
            black could quite feasibly just lag at blue and attempt to leave a
            rush to red. Bear in mind that playing this lag so early in the game
            may be difficult as you may not have the pace of the court - and
            there is a risk that lagging at blue and falling short will leave
            yellow a double target on turn 4.
          

            Another option if black is uncertain, would be to shoot at blue from
            C3, and missing through to C4. This hedges black's bets somewhat, as
            it is still taking a shot at a ball and still somewhat joining with
            partner ball, but does not give good break prospects to the opponent
            if yellow hits, due to the proximity of blue and black to one
            another. Yellow is faced with a long takeoff from red towards blue
            and black and in all likelihood will not get a rush to H1 from this
            position.
          

            The third option is of course to shoot at the tice itself. Hitting
            red will give the opportunity to make a dream leave (as shown at the
            top of the page). Missing red will send black towards C2, which will
            give black a free shot back through red and yellow if yellow misses
            its fourth-turn shot at red.
          





              Some common third-ball responses to a standard tice
            


Response to C2 ball after EB opening

          There are two common options after a second-turn C2 ball - both
          consist of shooting at partner. If partner is hit, then usually the
          play will be to take off to the red in C2, roquet it and then croquet
          it either into the centre of the court, or along the west boundary,
          then lag back to partner and leave a rush in-court. However, consider
          a game where you are the stronger player playing a very capable weaker
          player, if you do hit partner third turn, you can elect to just set a
          rush to the C2 ball instead of trying to retrieve it from C2. As the
          stronger player you may prefer this line of play, instead of digging
          out the C2 ball only for your opponent to hit on turn 4 and have an
          easy break.
        

          Usually the third-turn shot at partner with black will be from A
          baulk, joining up on the east boundary if missed. This leaves a long
          double target for yellow from the end of B baulk. A more defensive
          play would be to shoot at partner from C3 into C4. Doing this leaves
          almost no break prospects fourth-turn for yellow but, depending on the
          distance between blue and black, may give them the opportunity to join
          up.
        

          Another option for black on turn 3 would be to shoot at red in C2 -
          however usually this is only a viable option if red is exactly in the
          corner, as it will mean that missing red on the right leaves no double
          target for yellow. Alternatively, another option would be for black to
          join up with red near C2, about 3-4 feet south of it. Doing so leaves
          no double target from B baulk and gives good break prospects to black
          if yellow misses the 13 yarder, although it must be remembered that
          yellow also has good prospects if it hits the 13 yarder. Black joining
          up with red also leaves a defensive shot for yellow at blue from C3 to
          C4 which, if missed, leaves black a very long and tricky takeoff from
          C2 to the east boundary.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a C2 ball
            


Response to C2 / C4 ball after Supershot opening

          The third-turn response to this option depends greatly on your ability
          and also the ability of your opponent. Before you lay the supershot,
          you need to ask yourself "am I realistically good enough to play a
          third-turn break to 4-back?". If the answer is no, then that does not
          mean that the supershot opening is a bad idea at all, but it just
          means that you may want to reassess your third-turn response.
          Additionally, if you are playing someone that you believe is much
          better than you are, then trying to give yourself a 4-ball break on
          turn 5 is exactly what you should be trying to achieve. Therefore,
          instead of trying to roquet the 13 yard shot of black at red just
          south of C2 (or just north of C4), you can instead look to join up
          with the ball 3-4 feet away, ensuring to leave no double target. This
          puts a great deal of pressure on your stronger opponent to then hit a
          13 yarder or else concede a 4-ball break to you.
        

          If you believe you are good enough to hit on turn 3 and play a break,
          then the answer is simple - hit red near C2 and go round.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / C2 ball
            


Response to EB ball after Supershot opening

          In most cases, the third-turn response to a max distance ball is to
          try and hit it from C3, missing into C4. Again, however, you should
          evaluate your own likelihood of playing a break to 4-back with only 3
          balls on the lawn if you hit, and so you may want to consider lagging
          to the ball, a couple of yards in-lawn from the east boundary.
        

          If the ball on the east boundary is south of the peg, it is tempting
          to simply shoot at it from A baulk. Missing will of course leave a
          double from B baulk, but the odds of yellow then hitting a double
          target from 20+ yards is no certainty. Alternatively, if the
          second-turn ball is around peg-high, then shooting at it from B baulk
          from a few yards west of C3 and missing often results in a fairly even
          spread of the balls, with your black ball being approximately 8 yards
          south of red and 8 yards north of C4. This again is technically a
          double target from somewhere on B Baulk, but given the distance
          between red and black, is easily missed and will leave your black ball
          a shot of only 8 yards.

              ball
            


Response to C4 ball after EB opening

          This opening creates one of the more interesting third-turn decisions.
          A second-turn ball 6" north of C4 is a very threatening position and
          therefore the options will as follows:
        


            Shoot at partner
            
Hit - set a dream leave

                Miss - leaves yellow a 13-yard shot at red in C4 for a 4-ball
                break
              



            Shoot at opponent near C4 from A baulk
            

                Hit - set a dream leave (you may want to have a go at gaining a
                rush to H1 on partner)
              

                Miss - leave a 13-yard double for yellow (but slightly tricky
                break pick-up)
              



            Join up with opponent near C4, leaving no double
            

                If red is 3-6" north of C4 - join a yard north of it from A
                baulk
                
No short double target is left for yellow

                    Yellow still only has a 13-yard shot for the innings (but a
                    slightly tricky break pick-up)
                  



                If red is ~12" north of C4 - shoot from C3 through to C4
                

                    Enables black to have a shot (albeit very long) to attempt
                    to hit and set a dream leave
                  




Black to C2


              By burying itself in C2, this enables black to kill off the
              aggression by red and yellow. Any miss by yellow will leave a 9
              yarder (at most) for blue
            






              Some common third-ball responses to a C4 ball
            



          A personal preference of mine is to shoot third-turn at the ball near
          C4 from A baulk, because hitting gives me control of the court, and I
          miss often enough by more than several inches so as not to leave a
          double.
        

          Be on the lookout for cannons around C4 as part of this opening -
          there is often a good opportunity to bombard a live ball across to H1
          while playing a croquet stroke towards blue on the east boundary. This
          can make picking up the first break a great deal easier.
        
Response to duffer tice after EB opening

          The duffer tice is one of my favourite openings. Because of the
          placement of red near H6, a miss by black from the end of B baulk will
          be headed towards A baulk and give an easy start for yellow. That is
          why we see the ~9 yard shot at red refused so often, even by very
          strong players!
        

          If black does decide to shoot at the duffer and hits, then not a great
          deal of options are available other than to take off to partner ball
          (usually nudging red towards the peg in the process), and leave a rush
          towards red, and then hope for a fourth-turn miss by yellow.
        

          Another option for shooting at the duffer is doing so from C3,
          shooting across the court and missing to around peg-high (or just
          south of peg-high) on the west boundary. This is the most defensive
          shot available in that a miss gives no break to yellow if yellow hits
          red, but it also does not put any pressure on yellow's shot at red.
          Often times, when black misses the shot from C3 at red, it will end up
          south of peg-high on the west boundary and be a tempting free shot for
          yellow from C1.
        

          Shooting at partner ball on turn 3 is the most aggressive line of play
          - taking the shot from A baulk and hitting gives the opportunity to
          play a big croquet stroke loading partner to H2 and attempting to get
          a rush to H1 on the duffer ball - it is a big shot and the break
          chances are normally only reasonable for very strong players. Missing
          partner from A baulk on the other hand gives yellow a ~9 yard shot and
          very strong break prospects. It is therefore more usual to see black
          shoot at blue from C3 which, although longer, doesn't make all the
          balls available to yellow if black misses blue and yellow hits red. It
          also means that blue and black maintain a wide join and have realistic
          prospects of hitting back in if yellow misses red.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a duffer tice
            


Response to 2 balls on EB

          If red has shot at blue on turn 2 and missed, leaving both balls on
          the east boundary, you should carefully evaluate your response based
          on the strength of your opponent. If you and your opponent are evenly
          matched but not world class players, or especially if your opponent is
          a much stronger player than you, then the best thing to do here may be
          to simply ignore the two balls on the east boundary and lag black into
          the middle of the court and wait for yellow to miss. This potentially
          presents you with an immediate break with a ball in the middle of the
          court.
        

          In a match between two very strong players it would be unusual to see
          no shot taken on turn 3, and if hit, some attempt at digging out a
          3-ball break.
        
Response to 2 balls in-court

          In a situation where you have laid a supershot with blue, and red has
          lagged a couple of yards north east of your supershot ball, if there
          is no double target to be had from anywhere on the baulk lines, you
          must again consider your expectations after hitting third turn vs your
          opponent's likelihood of hitting fourth turn. As with previous
          options, if you are playing an opponent who on paper is a much
          stronger player, the percentage play is usually to lag the black ball
          into the middle of the court beside the other two balls (being mindful
          not to leave a double target from anywhere), which will put pressure
          on your stronger opponent to hit in or else concede the first break
          opportunity to you.
        

          If you do want to shoot with black at one of the balls in the middle,
          then consider either shooting at the easterly ball from C1 (you may
          even be able to shoot hard at this without missing to B baulk), or
          alternatively shooting at a medium pace at either blue or red from the
          closest point on A baulk. If you do shoot from the closest point, be
          sure to hit at a pace to finish slightly south of H6, both so that
          black is not a short shot from B baulk, and so that any double target
          that you leave has plenty of space between the front and back ball.
        

          If you are facing a third turn shot with black after red has
          cross-wired blue and red at the peg, check first to see if there is a
          point which you can lag to where blue won't be wired from black, and
          which won't be giving a double target from either baulk line - if
          there is such a spot, then that is the best place to lag to.

 Fourth Ball Options
      

The fourth-turn response is usually actually more simple than then third-turn response - although there are more possible scenarios, they almost always result in yellow trying to roquet something.  
      

Response to ignored WB tice
When black has ignored a standard west boundary tice and insetad shot at (and missed) partner on the east boundary, the obvious response is to then try and hit red yourself from C1.  If the placement of red is good, you should have ~50% chance of hitting in.  Your break prospects after hitting red are actually quite good, as you will play a take off from red to blue & black, which will automatically be sending red towards H2 as a pioneer.  On the other hand, a miss with yellow through red into C2 only gives fairly mediocre break prospects to blue & black in the next turn.
Response to missed WB tice
If black did indeed shoot at red (and miss) from C1 in the previous turn, then the obvious response is to shoot at red yourself, but from a point east of C1 so that a miss will leave yellow joined with red.  If you hit red, your best line of play would be to roll red &  yellow towards C1 and lay a rush for your next turn.  A miss from red at yellow will of course leave black a shot through red and yellow from C2 to C1 but is likely to be a very long shot at a single ball target.  A miss from black on turn 5 here also gives you a good chance at establishing a break on turn 5.  




              If black has missed the standard tice, it leaves a good opportunity to join up with red on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C2 ball after EB opening
Having played red into C2 on turn 2, if black ignores red and simply joins with blue (which is likely), then against most players your best line of play would be to shoot at blue and black with red.  Whether you shoot from A baulk or B baulk depends on factors such as the distance between blue and black (whether it is easy to make a double target from B baulk or A baulk) and the flatness of the east boundary.  If the black ball missed blue badly on the left on turn 3, blue and black may well be 2+ yards apart on the east boundary, so there is a defensive option available to yellow as well - shoot from C3 through to C4, where a miss would not give blue & black any easy opening.
If you are the weaker player against a very strong opponent, then there is a case for shooting yellow at red - at 13 yards, it is significantly shorter than any other available shot and is therefore your best chance at winning the opening.  Red missing yellow gives blue a relatively easy start and a probable break, but against a very strong opponent it can still be worth the risk.  




              Fourth-turn responses for yellow when partner is in C2 and opponent balls are on the east boundary.  
            


Response to joined / missed C2 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, if black has for some reason shot at red in C2, then assuming a double target has been left, your best aggressive option is to shoot at this, preferably hitting the northern ball, from B baulk.  A hit or a miss here will give fairly good break prospects to whomever plays the next shot, given C2's proximity to H2 - a semi-good pioneer can usually be sent to H2 while obtaining a rush to H1.
If black has instead joined up a yard south of red on turn 2, you have no double target (except from C1, but let's not consider that).  Now you have fundamentally two options - either shoot yellow at red which will give a good break opportunity if hit (and concede a good break opportunity to black if missed), or take a more defensive line by shooting yellow at blue from C3 into C4.  If yellow misses this shot, it does give black a 1-yard roquet at red for the innings, however it not only gives no break prospects, but also requires black to play several good strokes in order to have a good leave.  Black's take off from C2 to blue on the east boundary is a difficult shot, and if black doesn't succeed in roqueting blue in its next shot (either taking off short and missing blue, or taking off too far and sending black out) then yellow will have a 9-10 yard shot at blue & black from near C4.




              If black has joined a yard south of red near C2, the yellow has aggressive and defensive options available
            


Response to missed EB ball after Supershot opening
The response here depends a lot on both the length of the supershot ball and what option black chose on turn 3.  Firstly let's assume the most common scenario, with blue halfway between H5 and peg, and 1-2 yards west of the centre line, and red approximately peg high on the EB, and black in or near C4.  In this situation the best option is normally to shoot at red from A baulk, with a miss joining up around 1 yard north of it.  This leaves blue a 15-yarder at red & yellow but difficult break prospects for both players, whomever plays the next shot. 




              The common response after a third-turn miss by black at red to C4, is for yellow to shoot at red, joining if missing.  An aggressive line is to shoot at black.  A third option is yellow at blue, which is shorter and will win you the innings, but only gives good break prospects if red and black are near to each other
            


As the weaker player against a stronger player, a very aggressive line of play would be to shoot yellow from A baulk at black in C4 - this is very black and white, as a hit will give you a good chance for a 4-ball break and a miss will give black the same chance.  As the weaker player, you can strongly consider this option.  
Consider for a moment that black's third-turn shot missed red from A baulk, or perhaps missed red from west of C3, finishing 5-10 yards south of red.  In this case, yellow for look for possible double targets available from B baulk.  Consider, too, the shortest shot available, which is yellow at blue from A baulk - this is likely a 11-13 yard shot which, if hit, gives good break prospects to yellow because red and black are close together.
Response to ignored duffer tice
The vast majority of the time the best response to black ignoring red's duffer tice, is for yellow to shoot hard at red from B baulk.  Usually a duffer tice is only 9-10 yards and so it will be, by far, the shortest shot for yellow.




              The majority of the time, the fourth turn response would be to shoot yellow at the duffer.  Against a very strong player, you might be tempted by yellow at black in C4 which, although 3 yards longer, gives an easy start to your break
            


An expection to this would be if blue & black are joined on the east boundary leaving a good double target from A baulk, and so you may want to consider shooting at that instead.  Another option to consider is if black shot and missed blue from C3 to C4.  If you are playing against a much stronger opponent you may consider shooting yellow at black from A baulk into C4.  This shot is 3 yards longer than yellow at red from B baulk, but hitting this shot gives you vastly stronger break prospects than if you hit red first.
Response to missed duffer tice
If black misses the duffer tice (red) gently, the logical response is to shoot hard at either red from B baulk or black from A baulk (whichever is closer).  If black misses the duffer tice from C3 across to the west boundary, you may consider shooting at black from C1 through to C2, particularly if black is south of peg-high.  




              If the duffer tice is still in its original position at the start of turn 4, the general response is for yellow to shoot at red given its proximity to B baulk.  If black missed red from C3 however, it can be tempting to shoot at black from C1 on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C4 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, red a few inches north of C4 and black 1 yard north of blue, yellow's default response should be to shoot at red from A baulk.  Hitting this shot gives a great break opportunity, as it is a very natural stroke to croquet red to H2 while approaching blue & black up the east boundary.  
Response to 3 balls on EB
In this instance, you simply need to hit one of the balls on the east boundary - from either A baulk or B baulk, depending on length and available targets.
Response to 3 balls in-court
A supershot opening with lags by red and black essentially forces yellow to shoot at the closest ball.  A very black and white opening, good break prospects for both players on turn 4 or 5, depending on whether yellow hits or misses.  Often times, black will have take a gentle lag while attempting a roquet at either blue or red on turn 3, so this may also give yellow some target to shoot at on turn 4.

Conclusion
If you have gotten to the bottom of this article, you have probably realised by now that the number of opening options are vast.  This article could not hope to cover every eventuality, and nor does it present any new or unseen openings; rather it serves to talk through the options and thought processes for choosing a particular option, and I hope it has been useful.

Openings

        The opening is the battle between the two sides to be the first to gain
        the upper hand. Generally when we talk about openings in croquet, we are
        referring to the first 4 turns. At the very top level it is where games
        are won and lost, but at all levels it provides a fascinating array of
        options for bluffing and double-bluffing your opponent.
      
Opening priorities
As the stronger player

        The stronger player who is playing a dangerous but less experienced /
        weaker player will generally approach the opening with the intent of not
        giving away an easy break, and hence a more defensive mindset. Openings
        where there is a lot of grey area, balls on boundaries and in corners
        are best for this. The stronger player will generally rely on their
        better all-round game in order to win, and is more comfortable with
        digging balls out slowly into a break.
      
As the weaker player

        The weaker player should approach a game against a much stronger
        opponent with an attacking mindset - they will not be afraid to take on
        relatively short shots that give laid breaks, even if it means conceding
        a laid break if they miss. The weaker player should favour openings that
        have balls in-lawn and should be looking to put pressure on the stronger
        player to have to hit in.
      
Evenly-matched players

        It is quite common to see very aggressive, black and white, openings
        when two very strong players play against each other. The same is true
        for openings between evenly-matched players at lower levels, but
        generally to a lesser extent. A lot of the opening strategy depends on
        the individual mindset of the player, with some players naturally
        playing a more attacking game than others.
      

        Below are articles on various well-known (and some not-so-well-known)
        openings, which discuss options for placement of balls, and responses to
        them. For the purposes of simplicity, in the examples below, the balls
        will always be played in the following order:
      


 Blue
        

 Red
        


          Black
        


          Yellow
        


Note: there is no ball order or sequence in which the balls need to
          be added to the game in croquet - the above order is simply to keep
          things consistent for the diagrams and explanations.


        As you can probably imagine, the options in the opening are endless.
        This article attempts to talk through some of the most common options,
        and some of the most common responses to them, with the idea of
        clarifying some of the thought processes behind them.
      

The Dream Leave

        Many of the openings below will reference something known as the Dream
        Leave - this is a scenario where the third turn ball (black) has hit and
        arranged the court as follows:
      




            Black hit on turn 3 and set a dream leave
          



        Black has retrieved red from wherever it was on the court and placed it
        slightly in-lawn from the west boundary, north of peg-high, and left
        blue a rush to it from the east boundary. This leave gives no short shot
        for yellow, and any miss by yellow will give blue a good break
        opportunity.

 First
        Ball Options
      

East Boundary

          The most common option selected by the first ball player. A ball to
          the east boundary, somewhere between level with H4 and H5, is chosen
          due to its relative distance from both baulk lines and from H1. It is
          a completely non-threatening ball and allows the second ball player to
          dictate the nature of the game, be it defensive or aggressive.
        
In-lawn East Boundary ball

          A variation on the standard east boundary ball, the in-lawn east
          boundary ball is struck out in the same area as the standard east
          boundary ball, but purposefully left about 1 yard in from the yardline
          area. The idea behind that is so that black can play its third turn
          shot out behind blue and leave itself a rush in-court. This play
          discourages responses like a west boundary tice from red.
        
Supershot

          A supershot ball is a first-turn ball placed near the middle of the
          court, normally between H5 and peg and a couple of yards west of the
          centre line. This is the most aggressive sensible option for the first
          ball, and signals your intent to your opponent that you want no grey
          area. Given its proximity to H1, a supershot ball generally gives a
          good chance for a break for either player, depending on whether the
          third-turn, fourth-turn or fifth-turn shots are hit.
        

          There are variations on the length of the supershot, with a supershot
          played to near the peg being a poorer pioneer for H1 but having the
          advantage of lengthening any fourth-turn shot by yellow at it.
        
Anti-duffer

          This opening is an attempt to try and pre-empt the second-turn
          response and discourage a "duffer tice" by red. To lay an anti-duffer,
          you hit blue to a spot somewhere between H6 and the peg, and 1-2 yards
          west of the east boundary. The idea of placing a ball here is that if
          the opponent were to lay a duffer tice with red,
          then it gives black a good chance to hit red and take off behind blue
          for a rush to H1 on turn 3. It is a leave that is generally only used
          by strong players who have a realistic chance of a third-turn break in
          the first place.
        




              Some common first-ball scenarios
            


Unusual first-turn options

          The croquet court is a big place and so there really are endless
          options for where to place balls in the opening. Often an unusual
          option first-turn will yield good results by confusing the opponent!
        
C4 first ball

          Not often seen these days due to a preference for an east boundary
          ball 10 yards further north. A weakness of this opening is that
          shooting at partner on turn 3 and missing is liable to leave a double
          target for yellow. It also generally encourages yellow to take an
          aggressive shot on turn 4; however on a difficult lawn this opening
          can have some advantages, with any hit by yellow on turn 4 at balls in
          C4 leaving little room to promote balls into the court due to the
          close proximity to the corner.
        
C2 first ball

          Playing blue into C2 first turn can often catch the opponent off
          guard. This opening attempts to flip the tables on red and yellow by
          trying to ensure a defensive opening for blue and black. This can be a
          good option where blue and black are the stronger players and want to
          prevent aggressive second-turn options by red and yellow. Of course,
          there are options available to red and yellow which negate blue and
          black's defensive preferences.
        
Micro tice

          As unusual options go, this is right up there. This option would not
          be recommended when playing a strong player, but nevertheless is very
          interesting. The micro tice is a ball played from the end of A baulk
          towards the east boundary, but only 2-3 yards towards it, leaving a
          2-3 yard roquet for the opponent on the second turn. This length of
          shot cannot really be refused, but leaving red a croquet stroke from
          south-west of hoop 4 on the second turn of the game gives no real
          break prospects. Often the second turn player will attempt an approach
          to H1 and fail it, leaving a 6-yard roquet with two balls near H1 for
          black. This opening relies more on a tactical mistake from red than
          anything else
        
C1 / C3 opening

          Occasionally seen. Not a good opening against any experienced
          opponent, but occasionally yields results. This first-turn option is
          not to be recommended. A first-turn ball in C1 followed by a
          second-turn response to C3 (or vice versa) is a killer blow to black's
          turn.

 Second
        Ball Options
      


          This is where things start to get a little interesting. For the most
          part, the opening is dictated by the second ball response, and there
          are many more options available.
        
Response to East Boundary ball
Standard Tice

          The standard tice is one of the most popular responses to an east
          boundary ball at club-level croquet. Although in recent years it has
          fallen out of favour with top players (likely due to an increase in
          the standard of shooting), it is still a great opening that gives good
          chances to both sides.
        

          The standard tice is where red is played to the west boundary, and the
          distance it is placed north of C1 needs to be carefully considered by
          the striker or red. The name "tice" indicates that the distance should
          be enticing for the player of black to shoot at and so a distance of
          between about 8 and 13 yards is common. As a general rule, if possible
          the distance chosen should either be about 1 yard longer than the
          opponent's critical distance (the distance at which someone hits 50%
          of their shots) or 1 yard shorter (or equal to) your own critical
          distance. Obviously this cannot be achieved if your opponent has a
          longer critical distance than you do, so it is better to err slightly
          on the longer side.
        

          If blue is an in-lawn east boundary ball, laying a standard tice is
          risky, as black can quite easily lay a rush directly to it on the
          third turn.
        
C2 ball

          Probably the most common response to the east boundary ball today is
          the second-turn ball to 6" south of C2. The reason for playing just
          south of C2 is that if in the unlikely event of black shooting at red
          on turn 3, a miss will likely leave yellow a double target. The idea
          of red near C2 means that red is buried in a defensive position, and
          signals yellow's intent to shoot at blue and black on turn 4.
        

          If blue is slightly in-lawn, then C2 is the safest and most defensive
          response with red.
        
Duffer tice

          One of the more aggressive responses for red is the duffer tice. This
          is a ball that is placed usually about 2-feet north and a few inches
          east of penultimate. This is similarly enticing for the opponent to
          shoot (just as with a standard tice) but in this case a miss is
          usually more critical - any third turn shot at the duffer is in the
          direction of A baulk so black usually takes the shot gently - and by
          doing so is more likely to miss. Black missing leaves two balls in the
          centre of the court, giving yellow a great chance on turn 4. The
          duffer tice is a great option for weaker players playing against
          stronger players, and also for anyone confident in hitting 10 yarders.
        

          Between two very strong players a duffer tice is still a popular
          opening. There are variations on the placement of the ball near
          penult, based on the strength of the opponent. It is common to see a
          duffer tice placed level with, or south of, H6, particularly if the
          striker of red and yellow is a very good shot and is confident to hit
          an 11-yarder on turn 4. In a game between experts, the placement of
          red is sometimes moved to the west of H6 to discourage a third-turn
          break after a hit from black at blue.
        
C4 ball

          This option is very popular in New Zealand and although a mirror image
          of the C2 ball, is a lot more aggressive. Placing red 6" north of C4
          not only gives negligible break prospects to black on turn 3 but also
          signals your intent to hit fourth-turn with yellow and have a break. A
          miss at partner by black on turn 3 gives you a 13-yard shot for a
          4-ball break, and a miss by black at red on turn 3 usually gives a
          double target.
        
Shoot at first-turn ball

          A slightly counter-intuitive option but nonetheless an interesting
          one. Shooting red at blue on turn 2 and hitting gives no break
          prospects, but a miss also leaves very slim break prospects for black
          on turn 3 if it hits, unless black is a very strong player. With this
          opening it is quite common to see misses on both turns 2 and 3, and
          often a triple target for yellow at the other 3 balls on turn 4 from B
          baulk.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to east boundary opening
            


Response to Supershot ball

          The supershot ball is the most aggressive opening that the first-turn
          player can use. There are several responses to this which need to be
          considered, based on your assessment of your opponent's ability and
          whether the opponent has realistic prospects of a break to 4-back if
          they do manage to hit 3rd turn.
        
C2 response

          The C2 response is a ball played about 6" south of C2. This is a
          strong response to a supershot against almost all players. If the
          player of black wants to attempt a third-turn break, they will have to
          hit a 13-yarder and play a very difficult croquet stroke out of C2 to
          get a rush to H1, and this is by no means guaranteed. On the other
          hand, a miss by black at red on turn 3 will leave yellow a double
          target and a 4-ball break if hit.
        




              It is important to finish a few inches south of C2 with red as it
              will mean black missing on either side of it will leave a double
              target. Above is a comparison of yellow's target after a
              third-turn miss by black at red, firstly with red in C2 and
              secondly with red a few inches south of C2
            



          There are only a handful of players in the world where the C2 ball is
          not a great response - players who would expect to hit the 13 yarder
          most of the time and also be good enough at croquet strokes to expect
          to get a rush to H1 on the supershot ball. Against these players the
          strategy of lengthing the 3rd turn shot would be preferred.
        
C4 response

          Mirror image to the C2 response, this ball is played 6" north of C4.
          Consider this if blue (the supershot ball) is placed further north
          than normal (somewhere near peg-high), or is in a particular spot
          which may have H4 obscuring any croquet stroke from C4 towards it. It
          otherwise gives all the same advantages as the C2 response
        
Max Distance response

          As a counter to the very top players hitting the ball in C2 most of
          the time, the max distance response became popular - this is where red
          is played to the east boundary about level with the peg on the east
          boundary, leaving the longest shot possible for black. This response
          grants black a shot from C3 through red and into C4, reducing yellow's
          fourth-turn prospects - it relies more on black missing red than
          trying to make any break pick-up by black more difficult. Generally a
          good option against the very best players, but against most players is
          unnecessary.  
The reason why max distance on the east boundary is chosen instead of the equivalent max distance spot on the west boundary is that it is slightly further from the supershot ball (blue), which is slightly south-west of the peg.  Assuming that the shots on turns 3 and 4 are missed, blue's shot at red & yellow on the east boundary will be a couple of yards longer than the equivalent shot to the west boundary.  
Supershot lag

          The response for red to lag to a spot 3-4 yards east and 1-2 yards
          north of the supershot ball is a very strong and very under-used
          response to the supershot. This is a good tactic when playing someone
          who is a very good shot, and in particular if the supershot ball
          itself is quite deep (nearer the peg than H5). Placing red beside blue
          nullifies the strength of black's shooting by encouraging black to
          take its third turn shot gently (which is generally less accurate), or
          risk shooting hard and missing into B baulk, conceding a 4-ball break.
          In this case, black may choose not to shoot at all, and instead also
          lag to a position wide of the other two balls, meaning that red and
          yellow have successfully turned the tables of the supershot opening
          and enabled yellow to have the first attempted roquet.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to supershot opening
            


Roquet the Supershot ball

          The ultimate way to nullify the supershot ball - roquet it on the
          second turn. After roqueting blue with red, there are several options
          available. You can croquet blue towards C2 and then fire red off 6"
          north of C4. A more aggressive option would be to croquet blue
          north-west of H2 and fire red off the south boundary, south of H4 -
          this leaves black a choice of 7-8 yarders but minimal break prospects
          and difficult strokes with their third turn in order to distance the
          balls from baulk. A more novel option would be to crosswire blue and
          red at the peg, which leaves only a 17-yard shot for black with a
          baulk line in the background. An even more interesting option might be
          to roll blue close to the peg, either east or west, and then play red
          a yard or two away from it, wiring blue's backswing at red. This means
          that black probably has no lag option towards blue that doesn't leave
          a double-target for yellow.
        
Response to unusual first-turn options
Response to a first-turn C2 ball

          A first-turn C2 ball is an attempt by blue to make red conform to a
          defensive opening. Red could of course do this if it wants, by playing
          6" north of C4, or even by just having a "standard" east boundary
          ball; however a better option to negate blue's attempt at dictating
          the opening might be to set a duffer tice - this is the ultimate
          aggressive response to the C2 ball, and means that black is suddenly
          faced with having to hit a 10-13 yarder on turn 3 or risk leaving the
          same for yellow next turn, and a laid break.
        
Back to top



 Third
        Ball Options
      

        For the vast majority of players, if they manage to hit in on the third
        turn of the game, they will and should be looking to make a dream leave
        (see top of page) or similar, possibly with red near the peg and blue &
        black with a rush towards it. There are exceptions to this line of play,
        mainly with supershot openings, but unless otherwise stated, the
        standard play would be to try and set a dream leave.
      

Response to WB tice after EB opening

          Realistically, black will not be attempting to make any break on turn
          3 if it manages to hit in. The player of black has to make a judgement
          call on their likelihood of hitting the standard tice vs their
          opponent's likelihood of missing it.
        


            If the tice is long, the best response is probably to shoot black at
            blue from A baulk. Missing black at blue leaves the free shot at the
            tice for yellow of course, which does give yellow fairly good
            prospects if hit. If the tice is extremely long, say peg-high, then
            black could quite feasibly just lag at blue and attempt to leave a
            rush to red. Bear in mind that playing this lag so early in the game
            may be difficult as you may not have the pace of the court - and
            there is a risk that lagging at blue and falling short will leave
            yellow a double target on turn 4.
          

            Another option if black is uncertain, would be to shoot at blue from
            C3, and missing through to C4. This hedges black's bets somewhat, as
            it is still taking a shot at a ball and still somewhat joining with
            partner ball, but does not give good break prospects to the opponent
            if yellow hits, due to the proximity of blue and black to one
            another. Yellow is faced with a long takeoff from red towards blue
            and black and in all likelihood will not get a rush to H1 from this
            position.
          

            The third option is of course to shoot at the tice itself. Hitting
            red will give the opportunity to make a dream leave (as shown at the
            top of the page). Missing red will send black towards C2, which will
            give black a free shot back through red and yellow if yellow misses
            its fourth-turn shot at red.
          





              Some common third-ball responses to a standard tice
            


Response to C2 ball after EB opening

          There are two common options after a second-turn C2 ball - both
          consist of shooting at partner. If partner is hit, then usually the
          play will be to take off to the red in C2, roquet it and then croquet
          it either into the centre of the court, or along the west boundary,
          then lag back to partner and leave a rush in-court. However, consider
          a game where you are the stronger player playing a very capable weaker
          player, if you do hit partner third turn, you can elect to just set a
          rush to the C2 ball instead of trying to retrieve it from C2. As the
          stronger player you may prefer this line of play, instead of digging
          out the C2 ball only for your opponent to hit on turn 4 and have an
          easy break.
        

          Usually the third-turn shot at partner with black will be from A
          baulk, joining up on the east boundary if missed. This leaves a long
          double target for yellow from the end of B baulk. A more defensive
          play would be to shoot at partner from C3 into C4. Doing this leaves
          almost no break prospects fourth-turn for yellow but, depending on the
          distance between blue and black, may give them the opportunity to join
          up.
        

          Another option for black on turn 3 would be to shoot at red in C2 -
          however usually this is only a viable option if red is exactly in the
          corner, as it will mean that missing red on the right leaves no double
          target for yellow. Alternatively, another option would be for black to
          join up with red near C2, about 3-4 feet south of it. Doing so leaves
          no double target from B baulk and gives good break prospects to black
          if yellow misses the 13 yarder, although it must be remembered that
          yellow also has good prospects if it hits the 13 yarder. Black joining
          up with red also leaves a defensive shot for yellow at blue from C3 to
          C4 which, if missed, leaves black a very long and tricky takeoff from
          C2 to the east boundary.

Response to C2 / C4 ball after Supershot opening

          The third-turn response to this option depends greatly on your ability
          and also the ability of your opponent. Before you lay the supershot,
          you need to ask yourself "am I realistically good enough to play a
          third-turn break to 4-back?". If the answer is no, then that does not
          mean that the supershot opening is a bad idea at all, but it just
          means that you may want to reassess your third-turn response.
          Additionally, if you are playing someone that you believe is much
          better than you are, then trying to give yourself a 4-ball break on
          turn 5 is exactly what you should be trying to achieve. Therefore,
          instead of trying to roquet the 13 yard shot of black at red just
          south of C2 (or just north of C4), you can instead look to join up
          with the ball 3-4 feet away, ensuring to leave no double target. This
          puts a great deal of pressure on your stronger opponent to then hit a
          13 yarder or else concede a 4-ball break to you.
        

          If you believe you are good enough to hit on turn 3 and play a break,
          then the answer is simple - hit red near C2 and go round.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / C2 ball
            


Response to EB ball after Supershot opening

          In most cases, the third-turn response to a max distance ball is to
          try and hit it from C3, missing into C4. Again, however, you should
          evaluate your own likelihood of playing a break to 4-back with only 3
          balls on the lawn if you hit, and so you may want to consider lagging
          to the ball, a couple of yards in-lawn from the east boundary.
        

          If the ball on the east boundary is south of the peg, it is tempting
          to simply shoot at it from A baulk. Missing will of course leave a
          double from B baulk, but the odds of yellow then hitting a double
          target from 20+ yards is no certainty. Alternatively, if the
          second-turn ball is around peg-high, then shooting at it from B baulk
          from a few yards west of C3 and missing often results in a fairly even
          spread of the balls, with your black ball being approximately 8 yards
          south of red and 8 yards north of C4. This again is technically a
          double target from somewhere on B Baulk, but given the distance
          between red and black, is easily missed and will leave your black ball
          a shot of only 8 yards.

              ball
            


Response to C4 ball after EB opening

          This opening creates one of the more interesting third-turn decisions.
          A second-turn ball 6" north of C4 is a very threatening position and
          therefore the options will as follows:
        


            Shoot at partner
            
Hit - set a dream leave

                Miss - leaves yellow a 13-yard shot at red in C4 for a 4-ball
                break
              



            Shoot at opponent near C4 from A baulk
            

                Hit - set a dream leave (you may want to have a go at gaining a
                rush to H1 on partner)
              

                Miss - leave a 13-yard double for yellow (but slightly tricky
                break pick-up)
              



            Join up with opponent near C4, leaving no double
            

                If red is 3-6" north of C4 - join a yard north of it from A
                baulk
                
No short double target is left for yellow

                    Yellow still only has a 13-yard shot for the innings (but a
                    slightly tricky break pick-up)
                  



                If red is ~12" north of C4 - shoot from C3 through to C4
                

                    Enables black to have a shot (albeit very long) to attempt
                    to hit and set a dream leave
                  




Black to C2


              By burying itself in C2, this enables black to kill off the
              aggression by red and yellow. Any miss by yellow will leave a 9
              yarder (at most) for blue
            






              Some common third-ball responses to a C4 ball
            



          A personal preference of mine is to shoot third-turn at the ball near
          C4 from A baulk, because hitting gives me control of the court, and I
          miss often enough by more than several inches so as not to leave a
          double.
        

          Be on the lookout for cannons around C4 as part of this opening -
          there is often a good opportunity to bombard a live ball across to H1
          while playing a croquet stroke towards blue on the east boundary. This
          can make picking up the first break a great deal easier.
        
Response to duffer tice after EB opening

          The duffer tice is one of my favourite openings. Because of the
          placement of red near H6, a miss by black from the end of B baulk will
          be headed towards A baulk and give an easy start for yellow. That is
          why we see the ~9 yard shot at red refused so often, even by very
          strong players!
        

          If black does decide to shoot at the duffer and hits, then not a great
          deal of options are available other than to take off to partner ball
          (usually nudging red towards the peg in the process), and leave a rush
          towards red, and then hope for a fourth-turn miss by yellow.
        

          Another option for shooting at the duffer is doing so from C3,
          shooting across the court and missing to around peg-high (or just
          south of peg-high) on the west boundary. This is the most defensive
          shot available in that a miss gives no break to yellow if yellow hits
          red, but it also does not put any pressure on yellow's shot at red.
          Often times, when black misses the shot from C3 at red, it will end up
          south of peg-high on the west boundary and be a tempting free shot for
          yellow from C1.
        

          Shooting at partner ball on turn 3 is the most aggressive line of play
          - taking the shot from A baulk and hitting gives the opportunity to
          play a big croquet stroke loading partner to H2 and attempting to get
          a rush to H1 on the duffer ball - it is a big shot and the break
          chances are normally only reasonable for very strong players. Missing
          partner from A baulk on the other hand gives yellow a ~9 yard shot and
          very strong break prospects. It is therefore more usual to see black
          shoot at blue from C3 which, although longer, doesn't make all the
          balls available to yellow if black misses blue and yellow hits red. It
          also means that blue and black maintain a wide join and have realistic
          prospects of hitting back in if yellow misses red.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a duffer tice
            


Response to 2 balls on EB

          If red has shot at blue on turn 2 and missed, leaving both balls on
          the east boundary, you should carefully evaluate your response based
          on the strength of your opponent. If you and your opponent are evenly
          matched but not world class players, or especially if your opponent is
          a much stronger player than you, then the best thing to do here may be
          to simply ignore the two balls on the east boundary and lag black into
          the middle of the court and wait for yellow to miss. This potentially
          presents you with an immediate break with a ball in the middle of the
          court.
        

          In a match between two very strong players it would be unusual to see
          no shot taken on turn 3, and if hit, some attempt at digging out a
          3-ball break.
        
Response to 2 balls in-court

          In a situation where you have laid a supershot with blue, and red has
          lagged a couple of yards north east of your supershot ball, if there
          is no double target to be had from anywhere on the baulk lines, you
          must again consider your expectations after hitting third turn vs your
          opponent's likelihood of hitting fourth turn. As with previous
          options, if you are playing an opponent who on paper is a much
          stronger player, the percentage play is usually to lag the black ball
          into the middle of the court beside the other two balls (being mindful
          not to leave a double target from anywhere), which will put pressure
          on your stronger opponent to hit in or else concede the first break
          opportunity to you.
        

          If you do want to shoot with black at one of the balls in the middle,
          then consider either shooting at the easterly ball from C1 (you may
          even be able to shoot hard at this without missing to B baulk), or
          alternatively shooting at a medium pace at either blue or red from the
          closest point on A baulk. If you do shoot from the closest point, be
          sure to hit at a pace to finish slightly south of H6, both so that
          black is not a short shot from B baulk, and so that any double target
          that you leave has plenty of space between the front and back ball.
        

          If you are facing a third turn shot with black after red has
          cross-wired blue and red at the peg, check first to see if there is a
          point which you can lag to where blue won't be wired from black, and
          which won't be giving a double target from either baulk line - if
          there is such a spot, then that is the best place to lag to.

 Fourth Ball Options
      

The fourth-turn response is usually actually more simple than then third-turn response - although there are more possible scenarios, they almost always result in yellow trying to roquet something.  
      

Response to ignored WB tice
When black has ignored a standard west boundary tice and insetad shot at (and missed) partner on the east boundary, the obvious response is to then try and hit red yourself from C1.  If the placement of red is good, you should have ~50% chance of hitting in.  Your break prospects after hitting red are actually quite good, as you will play a take off from red to blue & black, which will automatically be sending red towards H2 as a pioneer.  On the other hand, a miss with yellow through red into C2 only gives fairly mediocre break prospects to blue & black in the next turn.
Response to missed WB tice
If black did indeed shoot at red (and miss) from C1 in the previous turn, then the obvious response is to shoot at red yourself, but from a point east of C1 so that a miss will leave yellow joined with red.  If you hit red, your best line of play would be to roll red &  yellow towards C1 and lay a rush for your next turn.  A miss from red at yellow will of course leave black a shot through red and yellow from C2 to C1 but is likely to be a very long shot at a single ball target.  A miss from black on turn 5 here also gives you a good chance at establishing a break on turn 5.  




              If black has missed the standard tice, it leaves a good opportunity to join up with red on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C2 ball after EB opening
Having played red into C2 on turn 2, if black ignores red and simply joins with blue (which is likely), then against most players your best line of play would be to shoot at blue and black with red.  Whether you shoot from A baulk or B baulk depends on factors such as the distance between blue and black (whether it is easy to make a double target from B baulk or A baulk) and the flatness of the east boundary.  If the black ball missed blue badly on the left on turn 3, blue and black may well be 2+ yards apart on the east boundary, so there is a defensive option available to yellow as well - shoot from C3 through to C4, where a miss would not give blue & black any easy opening.
If you are the weaker player against a very strong opponent, then there is a case for shooting yellow at red - at 13 yards, it is significantly shorter than any other available shot and is therefore your best chance at winning the opening.  Red missing yellow gives blue a relatively easy start and a probable break, but against a very strong opponent it can still be worth the risk.  




              Fourth-turn responses for yellow when partner is in C2 and opponent balls are on the east boundary.  
            


Response to joined / missed C2 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, if black has for some reason shot at red in C2, then assuming a double target has been left, your best aggressive option is to shoot at this, preferably hitting the northern ball, from B baulk.  A hit or a miss here will give fairly good break prospects to whomever plays the next shot, given C2's proximity to H2 - a semi-good pioneer can usually be sent to H2 while obtaining a rush to H1.
If black has instead joined up a yard south of red on turn 2, you have no double target (except from C1, but let's not consider that).  Now you have fundamentally two options - either shoot yellow at red which will give a good break opportunity if hit (and concede a good break opportunity to black if missed), or take a more defensive line by shooting yellow at blue from C3 into C4.  If yellow misses this shot, it does give black a 1-yard roquet at red for the innings, however it not only gives no break prospects, but also requires black to play several good strokes in order to have a good leave.  Black's take off from C2 to blue on the east boundary is a difficult shot, and if black doesn't succeed in roqueting blue in its next shot (either taking off short and missing blue, or taking off too far and sending black out) then yellow will have a 9-10 yard shot at blue & black from near C4.




              If black has joined a yard south of red near C2, the yellow has aggressive and defensive options available
            


Response to missed EB ball after Supershot opening
The response here depends a lot on both the length of the supershot ball and what option black chose on turn 3.  Firstly let's assume the most common scenario, with blue halfway between H5 and peg, and 1-2 yards west of the centre line, and red approximately peg high on the EB, and black in or near C4.  In this situation the best option is normally to shoot at red from A baulk, with a miss joining up around 1 yard north of it.  This leaves blue a 15-yarder at red & yellow but difficult break prospects for both players, whomever plays the next shot. 




              The common response after a third-turn miss by black at red to C4, is for yellow to shoot at red, joining if missing.  An aggressive line is to shoot at black.  A third option is yellow at blue, which is shorter and will win you the innings, but only gives good break prospects if red and black are near to each other
            


As the weaker player against a stronger player, a very aggressive line of play would be to shoot yellow from A baulk at black in C4 - this is very black and white, as a hit will give you a good chance for a 4-ball break and a miss will give black the same chance.  As the weaker player, you can strongly consider this option.  
Consider for a moment that black's third-turn shot missed red from A baulk, or perhaps missed red from west of C3, finishing 5-10 yards south of red.  In this case, yellow for look for possible double targets available from B baulk.  Consider, too, the shortest shot available, which is yellow at blue from A baulk - this is likely a 11-13 yard shot which, if hit, gives good break prospects to yellow because red and black are close together.
Response to ignored duffer tice
The vast majority of the time the best response to black ignoring red's duffer tice, is for yellow to shoot hard at red from B baulk.  Usually a duffer tice is only 9-10 yards and so it will be, by far, the shortest shot for yellow.




              The majority of the time, the fourth turn response would be to shoot yellow at the duffer.  Against a very strong player, you might be tempted by yellow at black in C4 which, although 3 yards longer, gives an easy start to your break
            


An expection to this would be if blue & black are joined on the east boundary leaving a good double target from A baulk, and so you may want to consider shooting at that instead.  Another option to consider is if black shot and missed blue from C3 to C4.  If you are playing against a much stronger opponent you may consider shooting yellow at black from A baulk into C4.  This shot is 3 yards longer than yellow at red from B baulk, but hitting this shot gives you vastly stronger break prospects than if you hit red first.
Response to missed duffer tice
If black misses the duffer tice (red) gently, the logical response is to shoot hard at either red from B baulk or black from A baulk (whichever is closer).  If black misses the duffer tice from C3 across to the west boundary, you may consider shooting at black from C1 through to C2, particularly if black is south of peg-high.  




              If the duffer tice is still in its original position at the start of turn 4, the general response is for yellow to shoot at red given its proximity to B baulk.  If black missed red from C3 however, it can be tempting to shoot at black from C1 on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C4 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, red a few inches north of C4 and black 1 yard north of blue, yellow's default response should be to shoot at red from A baulk.  Hitting this shot gives a great break opportunity, as it is a very natural stroke to croquet red to H2 while approaching blue & black up the east boundary.  
Response to 3 balls on EB
In this instance, you simply need to hit one of the balls on the east boundary - from either A baulk or B baulk, depending on length and available targets.
Response to 3 balls in-court
A supershot opening with lags by red and black essentially forces yellow to shoot at the closest ball.  A very black and white opening, good break prospects for both players on turn 4 or 5, depending on whether yellow hits or misses.  Often times, black will have take a gentle lag while attempting a roquet at either blue or red on turn 3, so this may also give yellow some target to shoot at on turn 4.

Conclusion
If you have gotten to the bottom of this article, you have probably realised by now that the number of opening options are vast.  This article could not hope to cover every eventuality, and nor does it present any new or unseen openings; rather it serves to talk through the options and thought processes for choosing a particular option, and I hope it has been useful.

Openings

        The opening is the battle between the two sides to be the first to gain
        the upper hand. Generally when we talk about openings in croquet, we are
        referring to the first 4 turns. At the very top level it is where games
        are won and lost, but at all levels it provides a fascinating array of
        options for bluffing and double-bluffing your opponent.
      
Opening priorities
As the stronger player

        The stronger player who is playing a dangerous but less experienced /
        weaker player will generally approach the opening with the intent of not
        giving away an easy break, and hence a more defensive mindset. Openings
        where there is a lot of grey area, balls on boundaries and in corners
        are best for this. The stronger player will generally rely on their
        better all-round game in order to win, and is more comfortable with
        digging balls out slowly into a break.
      
As the weaker player

        The weaker player should approach a game against a much stronger
        opponent with an attacking mindset - they will not be afraid to take on
        relatively short shots that give laid breaks, even if it means conceding
        a laid break if they miss. The weaker player should favour openings that
        have balls in-lawn and should be looking to put pressure on the stronger
        player to have to hit in.
      
Evenly-matched players

        It is quite common to see very aggressive, black and white, openings
        when two very strong players play against each other. The same is true
        for openings between evenly-matched players at lower levels, but
        generally to a lesser extent. A lot of the opening strategy depends on
        the individual mindset of the player, with some players naturally
        playing a more attacking game than others.
      

        Below are articles on various well-known (and some not-so-well-known)
        openings, which discuss options for placement of balls, and responses to
        them. For the purposes of simplicity, in the examples below, the balls
        will always be played in the following order:
      


 Blue
        

 Red
        


          Black
        


          Yellow
        


Note: there is no ball order or sequence in which the balls need to
          be added to the game in croquet - the above order is simply to keep
          things consistent for the diagrams and explanations.


        As you can probably imagine, the options in the opening are endless.
        This article attempts to talk through some of the most common options,
        and some of the most common responses to them, with the idea of
        clarifying some of the thought processes behind them.
      

The Dream Leave

        Many of the openings below will reference something known as the Dream
        Leave - this is a scenario where the third turn ball (black) has hit and
        arranged the court as follows:
      




            Black hit on turn 3 and set a dream leave
          



        Black has retrieved red from wherever it was on the court and placed it
        slightly in-lawn from the west boundary, north of peg-high, and left
        blue a rush to it from the east boundary. This leave gives no short shot
        for yellow, and any miss by yellow will give blue a good break
        opportunity.

 First
        Ball Options
      

East Boundary

          The most common option selected by the first ball player. A ball to
          the east boundary, somewhere between level with H4 and H5, is chosen
          due to its relative distance from both baulk lines and from H1. It is
          a completely non-threatening ball and allows the second ball player to
          dictate the nature of the game, be it defensive or aggressive.
        
In-lawn East Boundary ball

          A variation on the standard east boundary ball, the in-lawn east
          boundary ball is struck out in the same area as the standard east
          boundary ball, but purposefully left about 1 yard in from the yardline
          area. The idea behind that is so that black can play its third turn
          shot out behind blue and leave itself a rush in-court. This play
          discourages responses like a west boundary tice from red.
        
Supershot

          A supershot ball is a first-turn ball placed near the middle of the
          court, normally between H5 and peg and a couple of yards west of the
          centre line. This is the most aggressive sensible option for the first
          ball, and signals your intent to your opponent that you want no grey
          area. Given its proximity to H1, a supershot ball generally gives a
          good chance for a break for either player, depending on whether the
          third-turn, fourth-turn or fifth-turn shots are hit.
        

          There are variations on the length of the supershot, with a supershot
          played to near the peg being a poorer pioneer for H1 but having the
          advantage of lengthening any fourth-turn shot by yellow at it.
        
Anti-duffer

          This opening is an attempt to try and pre-empt the second-turn
          response and discourage a "duffer tice" by red. To lay an anti-duffer,
          you hit blue to a spot somewhere between H6 and the peg, and 1-2 yards
          west of the east boundary. The idea of placing a ball here is that if
          the opponent were to lay a duffer tice with red,
          then it gives black a good chance to hit red and take off behind blue
          for a rush to H1 on turn 3. It is a leave that is generally only used
          by strong players who have a realistic chance of a third-turn break in
          the first place.
        




              Some common first-ball scenarios
            


Unusual first-turn options

          The croquet court is a big place and so there really are endless
          options for where to place balls in the opening. Often an unusual
          option first-turn will yield good results by confusing the opponent!
        
C4 first ball

          Not often seen these days due to a preference for an east boundary
          ball 10 yards further north. A weakness of this opening is that
          shooting at partner on turn 3 and missing is liable to leave a double
          target for yellow. It also generally encourages yellow to take an
          aggressive shot on turn 4; however on a difficult lawn this opening
          can have some advantages, with any hit by yellow on turn 4 at balls in
          C4 leaving little room to promote balls into the court due to the
          close proximity to the corner.
        
C2 first ball

          Playing blue into C2 first turn can often catch the opponent off
          guard. This opening attempts to flip the tables on red and yellow by
          trying to ensure a defensive opening for blue and black. This can be a
          good option where blue and black are the stronger players and want to
          prevent aggressive second-turn options by red and yellow. Of course,
          there are options available to red and yellow which negate blue and
          black's defensive preferences.
        
Micro tice

          As unusual options go, this is right up there. This option would not
          be recommended when playing a strong player, but nevertheless is very
          interesting. The micro tice is a ball played from the end of A baulk
          towards the east boundary, but only 2-3 yards towards it, leaving a
          2-3 yard roquet for the opponent on the second turn. This length of
          shot cannot really be refused, but leaving red a croquet stroke from
          south-west of hoop 4 on the second turn of the game gives no real
          break prospects. Often the second turn player will attempt an approach
          to H1 and fail it, leaving a 6-yard roquet with two balls near H1 for
          black. This opening relies more on a tactical mistake from red than
          anything else
        
C1 / C3 opening

          Occasionally seen. Not a good opening against any experienced
          opponent, but occasionally yields results. This first-turn option is
          not to be recommended. A first-turn ball in C1 followed by a
          second-turn response to C3 (or vice versa) is a killer blow to black's
          turn.

 Second
        Ball Options
      


          This is where things start to get a little interesting. For the most
          part, the opening is dictated by the second ball response, and there
          are many more options available.
        
Response to East Boundary ball
Standard Tice

          The standard tice is one of the most popular responses to an east
          boundary ball at club-level croquet. Although in recent years it has
          fallen out of favour with top players (likely due to an increase in
          the standard of shooting), it is still a great opening that gives good
          chances to both sides.
        

          The standard tice is where red is played to the west boundary, and the
          distance it is placed north of C1 needs to be carefully considered by
          the striker or red. The name "tice" indicates that the distance should
          be enticing for the player of black to shoot at and so a distance of
          between about 8 and 13 yards is common. As a general rule, if possible
          the distance chosen should either be about 1 yard longer than the
          opponent's critical distance (the distance at which someone hits 50%
          of their shots) or 1 yard shorter (or equal to) your own critical
          distance. Obviously this cannot be achieved if your opponent has a
          longer critical distance than you do, so it is better to err slightly
          on the longer side.
        

          If blue is an in-lawn east boundary ball, laying a standard tice is
          risky, as black can quite easily lay a rush directly to it on the
          third turn.
        
C2 ball

          Probably the most common response to the east boundary ball today is
          the second-turn ball to 6" south of C2. The reason for playing just
          south of C2 is that if in the unlikely event of black shooting at red
          on turn 3, a miss will likely leave yellow a double target. The idea
          of red near C2 means that red is buried in a defensive position, and
          signals yellow's intent to shoot at blue and black on turn 4.
        

          If blue is slightly in-lawn, then C2 is the safest and most defensive
          response with red.
        
Duffer tice

          One of the more aggressive responses for red is the duffer tice. This
          is a ball that is placed usually about 2-feet north and a few inches
          east of penultimate. This is similarly enticing for the opponent to
          shoot (just as with a standard tice) but in this case a miss is
          usually more critical - any third turn shot at the duffer is in the
          direction of A baulk so black usually takes the shot gently - and by
          doing so is more likely to miss. Black missing leaves two balls in the
          centre of the court, giving yellow a great chance on turn 4. The
          duffer tice is a great option for weaker players playing against
          stronger players, and also for anyone confident in hitting 10 yarders.
        

          Between two very strong players a duffer tice is still a popular
          opening. There are variations on the placement of the ball near
          penult, based on the strength of the opponent. It is common to see a
          duffer tice placed level with, or south of, H6, particularly if the
          striker of red and yellow is a very good shot and is confident to hit
          an 11-yarder on turn 4. In a game between experts, the placement of
          red is sometimes moved to the west of H6 to discourage a third-turn
          break after a hit from black at blue.
        
C4 ball

          This option is very popular in New Zealand and although a mirror image
          of the C2 ball, is a lot more aggressive. Placing red 6" north of C4
          not only gives negligible break prospects to black on turn 3 but also
          signals your intent to hit fourth-turn with yellow and have a break. A
          miss at partner by black on turn 3 gives you a 13-yard shot for a
          4-ball break, and a miss by black at red on turn 3 usually gives a
          double target.
        
Shoot at first-turn ball

          A slightly counter-intuitive option but nonetheless an interesting
          one. Shooting red at blue on turn 2 and hitting gives no break
          prospects, but a miss also leaves very slim break prospects for black
          on turn 3 if it hits, unless black is a very strong player. With this
          opening it is quite common to see misses on both turns 2 and 3, and
          often a triple target for yellow at the other 3 balls on turn 4 from B
          baulk.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to east boundary opening
            


Response to Supershot ball

          The supershot ball is the most aggressive opening that the first-turn
          player can use. There are several responses to this which need to be
          considered, based on your assessment of your opponent's ability and
          whether the opponent has realistic prospects of a break to 4-back if
          they do manage to hit 3rd turn.
        
C2 response

          The C2 response is a ball played about 6" south of C2. This is a
          strong response to a supershot against almost all players. If the
          player of black wants to attempt a third-turn break, they will have to
          hit a 13-yarder and play a very difficult croquet stroke out of C2 to
          get a rush to H1, and this is by no means guaranteed. On the other
          hand, a miss by black at red on turn 3 will leave yellow a double
          target and a 4-ball break if hit.
        




              It is important to finish a few inches south of C2 with red as it
              will mean black missing on either side of it will leave a double
              target. Above is a comparison of yellow's target after a
              third-turn miss by black at red, firstly with red in C2 and
              secondly with red a few inches south of C2
            



          There are only a handful of players in the world where the C2 ball is
          not a great response - players who would expect to hit the 13 yarder
          most of the time and also be good enough at croquet strokes to expect
          to get a rush to H1 on the supershot ball. Against these players the
          strategy of lengthing the 3rd turn shot would be preferred.
        
C4 response

          Mirror image to the C2 response, this ball is played 6" north of C4.
          Consider this if blue (the supershot ball) is placed further north
          than normal (somewhere near peg-high), or is in a particular spot
          which may have H4 obscuring any croquet stroke from C4 towards it. It
          otherwise gives all the same advantages as the C2 response
        
Max Distance response

          As a counter to the very top players hitting the ball in C2 most of
          the time, the max distance response became popular - this is where red
          is played to the east boundary about level with the peg on the east
          boundary, leaving the longest shot possible for black. This response
          grants black a shot from C3 through red and into C4, reducing yellow's
          fourth-turn prospects - it relies more on black missing red than
          trying to make any break pick-up by black more difficult. Generally a
          good option against the very best players, but against most players is
          unnecessary.  
The reason why max distance on the east boundary is chosen instead of the equivalent max distance spot on the west boundary is that it is slightly further from the supershot ball (blue), which is slightly south-west of the peg.  Assuming that the shots on turns 3 and 4 are missed, blue's shot at red & yellow on the east boundary will be a couple of yards longer than the equivalent shot to the west boundary.  
Supershot lag

          The response for red to lag to a spot 3-4 yards east and 1-2 yards
          north of the supershot ball is a very strong and very under-used
          response to the supershot. This is a good tactic when playing someone
          who is a very good shot, and in particular if the supershot ball
          itself is quite deep (nearer the peg than H5). Placing red beside blue
          nullifies the strength of black's shooting by encouraging black to
          take its third turn shot gently (which is generally less accurate), or
          risk shooting hard and missing into B baulk, conceding a 4-ball break.
          In this case, black may choose not to shoot at all, and instead also
          lag to a position wide of the other two balls, meaning that red and
          yellow have successfully turned the tables of the supershot opening
          and enabled yellow to have the first attempted roquet.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to supershot opening
            


Roquet the Supershot ball

          The ultimate way to nullify the supershot ball - roquet it on the
          second turn. After roqueting blue with red, there are several options
          available. You can croquet blue towards C2 and then fire red off 6"
          north of C4. A more aggressive option would be to croquet blue
          north-west of H2 and fire red off the south boundary, south of H4 -
          this leaves black a choice of 7-8 yarders but minimal break prospects
          and difficult strokes with their third turn in order to distance the
          balls from baulk. A more novel option would be to crosswire blue and
          red at the peg, which leaves only a 17-yard shot for black with a
          baulk line in the background. An even more interesting option might be
          to roll blue close to the peg, either east or west, and then play red
          a yard or two away from it, wiring blue's backswing at red. This means
          that black probably has no lag option towards blue that doesn't leave
          a double-target for yellow.
        
Response to unusual first-turn options
Response to a first-turn C2 ball

          A first-turn C2 ball is an attempt by blue to make red conform to a
          defensive opening. Red could of course do this if it wants, by playing
          6" north of C4, or even by just having a "standard" east boundary
          ball; however a better option to negate blue's attempt at dictating
          the opening might be to set a duffer tice - this is the ultimate
          aggressive response to the C2 ball, and means that black is suddenly
          faced with having to hit a 10-13 yarder on turn 3 or risk leaving the
          same for yellow next turn, and a laid break.
        
Back to top



 Third
        Ball Options
      

        For the vast majority of players, if they manage to hit in on the third
        turn of the game, they will and should be looking to make a dream leave
        (see top of page) or similar, possibly with red near the peg and blue &
        black with a rush towards it. There are exceptions to this line of play,
        mainly with supershot openings, but unless otherwise stated, the
        standard play would be to try and set a dream leave.
      

Response to WB tice after EB opening

          Realistically, black will not be attempting to make any break on turn
          3 if it manages to hit in. The player of black has to make a judgement
          call on their likelihood of hitting the standard tice vs their
          opponent's likelihood of missing it.
        


            If the tice is long, the best response is probably to shoot black at
            blue from A baulk. Missing black at blue leaves the free shot at the
            tice for yellow of course, which does give yellow fairly good
            prospects if hit. If the tice is extremely long, say peg-high, then
            black could quite feasibly just lag at blue and attempt to leave a
            rush to red. Bear in mind that playing this lag so early in the game
            may be difficult as you may not have the pace of the court - and
            there is a risk that lagging at blue and falling short will leave
            yellow a double target on turn 4.
          

            Another option if black is uncertain, would be to shoot at blue from
            C3, and missing through to C4. This hedges black's bets somewhat, as
            it is still taking a shot at a ball and still somewhat joining with
            partner ball, but does not give good break prospects to the opponent
            if yellow hits, due to the proximity of blue and black to one
            another. Yellow is faced with a long takeoff from red towards blue
            and black and in all likelihood will not get a rush to H1 from this
            position.
          

            The third option is of course to shoot at the tice itself. Hitting
            red will give the opportunity to make a dream leave (as shown at the
            top of the page). Missing red will send black towards C2, which will
            give black a free shot back through red and yellow if yellow misses
            its fourth-turn shot at red.
          





              Some common third-ball responses to a standard tice
            


Response to C2 ball after EB opening

          There are two common options after a second-turn C2 ball - both
          consist of shooting at partner. If partner is hit, then usually the
          play will be to take off to the red in C2, roquet it and then croquet
          it either into the centre of the court, or along the west boundary,
          then lag back to partner and leave a rush in-court. However, consider
          a game where you are the stronger player playing a very capable weaker
          player, if you do hit partner third turn, you can elect to just set a
          rush to the C2 ball instead of trying to retrieve it from C2. As the
          stronger player you may prefer this line of play, instead of digging
          out the C2 ball only for your opponent to hit on turn 4 and have an
          easy break.
        

          Usually the third-turn shot at partner with black will be from A
          baulk, joining up on the east boundary if missed. This leaves a long
          double target for yellow from the end of B baulk. A more defensive
          play would be to shoot at partner from C3 into C4. Doing this leaves
          almost no break prospects fourth-turn for yellow but, depending on the
          distance between blue and black, may give them the opportunity to join
          up.
        

          Another option for black on turn 3 would be to shoot at red in C2 -
          however usually this is only a viable option if red is exactly in the
          corner, as it will mean that missing red on the right leaves no double
          target for yellow. Alternatively, another option would be for black to
          join up with red near C2, about 3-4 feet south of it. Doing so leaves
          no double target from B baulk and gives good break prospects to black
          if yellow misses the 13 yarder, although it must be remembered that
          yellow also has good prospects if it hits the 13 yarder. Black joining
          up with red also leaves a defensive shot for yellow at blue from C3 to
          C4 which, if missed, leaves black a very long and tricky takeoff from
          C2 to the east boundary.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a C2 ball
            


Response to C2 / C4 ball after Supershot opening

          The third-turn response to this option depends greatly on your ability
          and also the ability of your opponent. Before you lay the supershot,
          you need to ask yourself "am I realistically good enough to play a
          third-turn break to 4-back?". If the answer is no, then that does not
          mean that the supershot opening is a bad idea at all, but it just
          means that you may want to reassess your third-turn response.
          Additionally, if you are playing someone that you believe is much
          better than you are, then trying to give yourself a 4-ball break on
          turn 5 is exactly what you should be trying to achieve. Therefore,
          instead of trying to roquet the 13 yard shot of black at red just
          south of C2 (or just north of C4), you can instead look to join up
          with the ball 3-4 feet away, ensuring to leave no double target. This
          puts a great deal of pressure on your stronger opponent to then hit a
          13 yarder or else concede a 4-ball break to you.
        

          If you believe you are good enough to hit on turn 3 and play a break,
          then the answer is simple - hit red near C2 and go round.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / C2 ball
            


Response to EB ball after Supershot opening

          In most cases, the third-turn response to a max distance ball is to
          try and hit it from C3, missing into C4. Again, however, you should
          evaluate your own likelihood of playing a break to 4-back with only 3
          balls on the lawn if you hit, and so you may want to consider lagging
          to the ball, a couple of yards in-lawn from the east boundary.
        

          If the ball on the east boundary is south of the peg, it is tempting
          to simply shoot at it from A baulk. Missing will of course leave a
          double from B baulk, but the odds of yellow then hitting a double
          target from 20+ yards is no certainty. Alternatively, if the
          second-turn ball is around peg-high, then shooting at it from B baulk
          from a few yards west of C3 and missing often results in a fairly even
          spread of the balls, with your black ball being approximately 8 yards
          south of red and 8 yards north of C4. This again is technically a
          double target from somewhere on B Baulk, but given the distance
          between red and black, is easily missed and will leave your black ball
          a shot of only 8 yards.

Response to C4 ball after EB opening

          This opening creates one of the more interesting third-turn decisions.
          A second-turn ball 6" north of C4 is a very threatening position and
          therefore the options will as follows:
        


            Shoot at partner
            
Hit - set a dream leave

                Miss - leaves yellow a 13-yard shot at red in C4 for a 4-ball
                break
              



            Shoot at opponent near C4 from A baulk
            

                Hit - set a dream leave (you may want to have a go at gaining a
                rush to H1 on partner)
              

                Miss - leave a 13-yard double for yellow (but slightly tricky
                break pick-up)
              



            Join up with opponent near C4, leaving no double
            

                If red is 3-6" north of C4 - join a yard north of it from A
                baulk
                
No short double target is left for yellow

                    Yellow still only has a 13-yard shot for the innings (but a
                    slightly tricky break pick-up)
                  



                If red is ~12" north of C4 - shoot from C3 through to C4
                

                    Enables black to have a shot (albeit very long) to attempt
                    to hit and set a dream leave
                  




Black to C2


              By burying itself in C2, this enables black to kill off the
              aggression by red and yellow. Any miss by yellow will leave a 9
              yarder (at most) for blue
            






              Some common third-ball responses to a C4 ball
            



          A personal preference of mine is to shoot third-turn at the ball near
          C4 from A baulk, because hitting gives me control of the court, and I
          miss often enough by more than several inches so as not to leave a
          double.
        

          Be on the lookout for cannons around C4 as part of this opening -
          there is often a good opportunity to bombard a live ball across to H1
          while playing a croquet stroke towards blue on the east boundary. This
          can make picking up the first break a great deal easier.
        
Response to duffer tice after EB opening

          The duffer tice is one of my favourite openings. Because of the
          placement of red near H6, a miss by black from the end of B baulk will
          be headed towards A baulk and give an easy start for yellow. That is
          why we see the ~9 yard shot at red refused so often, even by very
          strong players!
        

          If black does decide to shoot at the duffer and hits, then not a great
          deal of options are available other than to take off to partner ball
          (usually nudging red towards the peg in the process), and leave a rush
          towards red, and then hope for a fourth-turn miss by yellow.
        

          Another option for shooting at the duffer is doing so from C3,
          shooting across the court and missing to around peg-high (or just
          south of peg-high) on the west boundary. This is the most defensive
          shot available in that a miss gives no break to yellow if yellow hits
          red, but it also does not put any pressure on yellow's shot at red.
          Often times, when black misses the shot from C3 at red, it will end up
          south of peg-high on the west boundary and be a tempting free shot for
          yellow from C1.
        

          Shooting at partner ball on turn 3 is the most aggressive line of play
          - taking the shot from A baulk and hitting gives the opportunity to
          play a big croquet stroke loading partner to H2 and attempting to get
          a rush to H1 on the duffer ball - it is a big shot and the break
          chances are normally only reasonable for very strong players. Missing
          partner from A baulk on the other hand gives yellow a ~9 yard shot and
          very strong break prospects. It is therefore more usual to see black
          shoot at blue from C3 which, although longer, doesn't make all the
          balls available to yellow if black misses blue and yellow hits red. It
          also means that blue and black maintain a wide join and have realistic
          prospects of hitting back in if yellow misses red.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a duffer tice
            


Response to 2 balls on EB

          If red has shot at blue on turn 2 and missed, leaving both balls on
          the east boundary, you should carefully evaluate your response based
          on the strength of your opponent. If you and your opponent are evenly
          matched but not world class players, or especially if your opponent is
          a much stronger player than you, then the best thing to do here may be
          to simply ignore the two balls on the east boundary and lag black into
          the middle of the court and wait for yellow to miss. This potentially
          presents you with an immediate break with a ball in the middle of the
          court.
        

          In a match between two very strong players it would be unusual to see
          no shot taken on turn 3, and if hit, some attempt at digging out a
          3-ball break.
        
Response to 2 balls in-court

          In a situation where you have laid a supershot with blue, and red has
          lagged a couple of yards north east of your supershot ball, if there
          is no double target to be had from anywhere on the baulk lines, you
          must again consider your expectations after hitting third turn vs your
          opponent's likelihood of hitting fourth turn. As with previous
          options, if you are playing an opponent who on paper is a much
          stronger player, the percentage play is usually to lag the black ball
          into the middle of the court beside the other two balls (being mindful
          not to leave a double target from anywhere), which will put pressure
          on your stronger opponent to hit in or else concede the first break
          opportunity to you.
        

          If you do want to shoot with black at one of the balls in the middle,
          then consider either shooting at the easterly ball from C1 (you may
          even be able to shoot hard at this without missing to B baulk), or
          alternatively shooting at a medium pace at either blue or red from the
          closest point on A baulk. If you do shoot from the closest point, be
          sure to hit at a pace to finish slightly south of H6, both so that
          black is not a short shot from B baulk, and so that any double target
          that you leave has plenty of space between the front and back ball.
        

          If you are facing a third turn shot with black after red has
          cross-wired blue and red at the peg, check first to see if there is a
          point which you can lag to where blue won't be wired from black, and
          which won't be giving a double target from either baulk line - if
          there is such a spot, then that is the best place to lag to.

 Fourth Ball Options
      

The fourth-turn response is usually actually more simple than then third-turn response - although there are more possible scenarios, they almost always result in yellow trying to roquet something.  
      

Response to ignored WB tice
When black has ignored a standard west boundary tice and insetad shot at (and missed) partner on the east boundary, the obvious response is to then try and hit red yourself from C1.  If the placement of red is good, you should have ~50% chance of hitting in.  Your break prospects after hitting red are actually quite good, as you will play a take off from red to blue & black, which will automatically be sending red towards H2 as a pioneer.  On the other hand, a miss with yellow through red into C2 only gives fairly mediocre break prospects to blue & black in the next turn.
Response to missed WB tice
If black did indeed shoot at red (and miss) from C1 in the previous turn, then the obvious response is to shoot at red yourself, but from a point east of C1 so that a miss will leave yellow joined with red.  If you hit red, your best line of play would be to roll red &  yellow towards C1 and lay a rush for your next turn.  A miss from red at yellow will of course leave black a shot through red and yellow from C2 to C1 but is likely to be a very long shot at a single ball target.  A miss from black on turn 5 here also gives you a good chance at establishing a break on turn 5.  




              If black has missed the standard tice, it leaves a good opportunity to join up with red on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C2 ball after EB opening
Having played red into C2 on turn 2, if black ignores red and simply joins with blue (which is likely), then against most players your best line of play would be to shoot at blue and black with red.  Whether you shoot from A baulk or B baulk depends on factors such as the distance between blue and black (whether it is easy to make a double target from B baulk or A baulk) and the flatness of the east boundary.  If the black ball missed blue badly on the left on turn 3, blue and black may well be 2+ yards apart on the east boundary, so there is a defensive option available to yellow as well - shoot from C3 through to C4, where a miss would not give blue & black any easy opening.
If you are the weaker player against a very strong opponent, then there is a case for shooting yellow at red - at 13 yards, it is significantly shorter than any other available shot and is therefore your best chance at winning the opening.  Red missing yellow gives blue a relatively easy start and a probable break, but against a very strong opponent it can still be worth the risk.  




              Fourth-turn responses for yellow when partner is in C2 and opponent balls are on the east boundary.  
            


Response to joined / missed C2 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, if black has for some reason shot at red in C2, then assuming a double target has been left, your best aggressive option is to shoot at this, preferably hitting the northern ball, from B baulk.  A hit or a miss here will give fairly good break prospects to whomever plays the next shot, given C2's proximity to H2 - a semi-good pioneer can usually be sent to H2 while obtaining a rush to H1.
If black has instead joined up a yard south of red on turn 2, you have no double target (except from C1, but let's not consider that).  Now you have fundamentally two options - either shoot yellow at red which will give a good break opportunity if hit (and concede a good break opportunity to black if missed), or take a more defensive line by shooting yellow at blue from C3 into C4.  If yellow misses this shot, it does give black a 1-yard roquet at red for the innings, however it not only gives no break prospects, but also requires black to play several good strokes in order to have a good leave.  Black's take off from C2 to blue on the east boundary is a difficult shot, and if black doesn't succeed in roqueting blue in its next shot (either taking off short and missing blue, or taking off too far and sending black out) then yellow will have a 9-10 yard shot at blue & black from near C4.




              If black has joined a yard south of red near C2, the yellow has aggressive and defensive options available
            


Response to missed EB ball after Supershot opening
The response here depends a lot on both the length of the supershot ball and what option black chose on turn 3.  Firstly let's assume the most common scenario, with blue halfway between H5 and peg, and 1-2 yards west of the centre line, and red approximately peg high on the EB, and black in or near C4.  In this situation the best option is normally to shoot at red from A baulk, with a miss joining up around 1 yard north of it.  This leaves blue a 15-yarder at red & yellow but difficult break prospects for both players, whomever plays the next shot. 




              The common response after a third-turn miss by black at red to C4, is for yellow to shoot at red, joining if missing.  An aggressive line is to shoot at black.  A third option is yellow at blue, which is shorter and will win you the innings, but only gives good break prospects if red and black are near to each other
            


As the weaker player against a stronger player, a very aggressive line of play would be to shoot yellow from A baulk at black in C4 - this is very black and white, as a hit will give you a good chance for a 4-ball break and a miss will give black the same chance.  As the weaker player, you can strongly consider this option.  
Consider for a moment that black's third-turn shot missed red from A baulk, or perhaps missed red from west of C3, finishing 5-10 yards south of red.  In this case, yellow for look for possible double targets available from B baulk.  Consider, too, the shortest shot available, which is yellow at blue from A baulk - this is likely a 11-13 yard shot which, if hit, gives good break prospects to yellow because red and black are close together.
Response to ignored duffer tice
The vast majority of the time the best response to black ignoring red's duffer tice, is for yellow to shoot hard at red from B baulk.  Usually a duffer tice is only 9-10 yards and so it will be, by far, the shortest shot for yellow.




              The majority of the time, the fourth turn response would be to shoot yellow at the duffer.  Against a very strong player, you might be tempted by yellow at black in C4 which, although 3 yards longer, gives an easy start to your break
            


An expection to this would be if blue & black are joined on the east boundary leaving a good double target from A baulk, and so you may want to consider shooting at that instead.  Another option to consider is if black shot and missed blue from C3 to C4.  If you are playing against a much stronger opponent you may consider shooting yellow at black from A baulk into C4.  This shot is 3 yards longer than yellow at red from B baulk, but hitting this shot gives you vastly stronger break prospects than if you hit red first.
Response to missed duffer tice
If black misses the duffer tice (red) gently, the logical response is to shoot hard at either red from B baulk or black from A baulk (whichever is closer).  If black misses the duffer tice from C3 across to the west boundary, you may consider shooting at black from C1 through to C2, particularly if black is south of peg-high.  




              If the duffer tice is still in its original position at the start of turn 4, the general response is for yellow to shoot at red given its proximity to B baulk.  If black missed red from C3 however, it can be tempting to shoot at black from C1 on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C4 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, red a few inches north of C4 and black 1 yard north of blue, yellow's default response should be to shoot at red from A baulk.  Hitting this shot gives a great break opportunity, as it is a very natural stroke to croquet red to H2 while approaching blue & black up the east boundary.  
Response to 3 balls on EB
In this instance, you simply need to hit one of the balls on the east boundary - from either A baulk or B baulk, depending on length and available targets.
Response to 3 balls in-court
A supershot opening with lags by red and black essentially forces yellow to shoot at the closest ball.  A very black and white opening, good break prospects for both players on turn 4 or 5, depending on whether yellow hits or misses.  Often times, black will have take a gentle lag while attempting a roquet at either blue or red on turn 3, so this may also give yellow some target to shoot at on turn 4.

Conclusion
If you have gotten to the bottom of this article, you have probably realised by now that the number of opening options are vast.  This article could not hope to cover every eventuality, and nor does it present any new or unseen openings; rather it serves to talk through the options and thought processes for choosing a particular option, and I hope it has been useful.

Openings

        The opening is the battle between the two sides to be the first to gain
        the upper hand. Generally when we talk about openings in croquet, we are
        referring to the first 4 turns. At the very top level it is where games
        are won and lost, but at all levels it provides a fascinating array of
        options for bluffing and double-bluffing your opponent.
      
Opening priorities
As the stronger player

        The stronger player who is playing a dangerous but less experienced /
        weaker player will generally approach the opening with the intent of not
        giving away an easy break, and hence a more defensive mindset. Openings
        where there is a lot of grey area, balls on boundaries and in corners
        are best for this. The stronger player will generally rely on their
        better all-round game in order to win, and is more comfortable with
        digging balls out slowly into a break.
      
As the weaker player

        The weaker player should approach a game against a much stronger
        opponent with an attacking mindset - they will not be afraid to take on
        relatively short shots that give laid breaks, even if it means conceding
        a laid break if they miss. The weaker player should favour openings that
        have balls in-lawn and should be looking to put pressure on the stronger
        player to have to hit in.
      
Evenly-matched players

        It is quite common to see very aggressive, black and white, openings
        when two very strong players play against each other. The same is true
        for openings between evenly-matched players at lower levels, but
        generally to a lesser extent. A lot of the opening strategy depends on
        the individual mindset of the player, with some players naturally
        playing a more attacking game than others.
      

        Below are articles on various well-known (and some not-so-well-known)
        openings, which discuss options for placement of balls, and responses to
        them. For the purposes of simplicity, in the examples below, the balls
        will always be played in the following order:
      


 Blue
        

 Red
        


          Black
        


          Yellow
        


Note: there is no ball order or sequence in which the balls need to
          be added to the game in croquet - the above order is simply to keep
          things consistent for the diagrams and explanations.


        As you can probably imagine, the options in the opening are endless.
        This article attempts to talk through some of the most common options,
        and some of the most common responses to them, with the idea of
        clarifying some of the thought processes behind them.
      

The Dream Leave

        Many of the openings below will reference something known as the Dream
        Leave - this is a scenario where the third turn ball (black) has hit and
        arranged the court as follows:
      




            Black hit on turn 3 and set a dream leave
          



        Black has retrieved red from wherever it was on the court and placed it
        slightly in-lawn from the west boundary, north of peg-high, and left
        blue a rush to it from the east boundary. This leave gives no short shot
        for yellow, and any miss by yellow will give blue a good break
        opportunity.

 First
        Ball Options
      

East Boundary

          The most common option selected by the first ball player. A ball to
          the east boundary, somewhere between level with H4 and H5, is chosen
          due to its relative distance from both baulk lines and from H1. It is
          a completely non-threatening ball and allows the second ball player to
          dictate the nature of the game, be it defensive or aggressive.
        
In-lawn East Boundary ball

          A variation on the standard east boundary ball, the in-lawn east
          boundary ball is struck out in the same area as the standard east
          boundary ball, but purposefully left about 1 yard in from the yardline
          area. The idea behind that is so that black can play its third turn
          shot out behind blue and leave itself a rush in-court. This play
          discourages responses like a west boundary tice from red.
        
Supershot

          A supershot ball is a first-turn ball placed near the middle of the
          court, normally between H5 and peg and a couple of yards west of the
          centre line. This is the most aggressive sensible option for the first
          ball, and signals your intent to your opponent that you want no grey
          area. Given its proximity to H1, a supershot ball generally gives a
          good chance for a break for either player, depending on whether the
          third-turn, fourth-turn or fifth-turn shots are hit.
        

          There are variations on the length of the supershot, with a supershot
          played to near the peg being a poorer pioneer for H1 but having the
          advantage of lengthening any fourth-turn shot by yellow at it.
        
Anti-duffer

          This opening is an attempt to try and pre-empt the second-turn
          response and discourage a "duffer tice" by red. To lay an anti-duffer,
          you hit blue to a spot somewhere between H6 and the peg, and 1-2 yards
          west of the east boundary. The idea of placing a ball here is that if
          the opponent were to lay a duffer tice with red,
          then it gives black a good chance to hit red and take off behind blue
          for a rush to H1 on turn 3. It is a leave that is generally only used
          by strong players who have a realistic chance of a third-turn break in
          the first place.

          The croquet court is a big place and so there really are endless
          options for where to place balls in the opening. Often an unusual
          option first-turn will yield good results by confusing the opponent!
        
C4 first ball

          Not often seen these days due to a preference for an east boundary
          ball 10 yards further north. A weakness of this opening is that
          shooting at partner on turn 3 and missing is liable to leave a double
          target for yellow. It also generally encourages yellow to take an
          aggressive shot on turn 4; however on a difficult lawn this opening
          can have some advantages, with any hit by yellow on turn 4 at balls in
          C4 leaving little room to promote balls into the court due to the
          close proximity to the corner.
        
C2 first ball

          Playing blue into C2 first turn can often catch the opponent off
          guard. This opening attempts to flip the tables on red and yellow by
          trying to ensure a defensive opening for blue and black. This can be a
          good option where blue and black are the stronger players and want to
          prevent aggressive second-turn options by red and yellow. Of course,
          there are options available to red and yellow which negate blue and
          black's defensive preferences.
        
Micro tice

          As unusual options go, this is right up there. This option would not
          be recommended when playing a strong player, but nevertheless is very
          interesting. The micro tice is a ball played from the end of A baulk
          towards the east boundary, but only 2-3 yards towards it, leaving a
          2-3 yard roquet for the opponent on the second turn. This length of
          shot cannot really be refused, but leaving red a croquet stroke from
          south-west of hoop 4 on the second turn of the game gives no real
          break prospects. Often the second turn player will attempt an approach
          to H1 and fail it, leaving a 6-yard roquet with two balls near H1 for
          black. This opening relies more on a tactical mistake from red than
          anything else
        
C1 / C3 opening

          Occasionally seen. Not a good opening against any experienced
          opponent, but occasionally yields results. This first-turn option is
          not to be recommended. A first-turn ball in C1 followed by a
          second-turn response to C3 (or vice versa) is a killer blow to black's
          turn.

 Second
        Ball Options
      


          This is where things start to get a little interesting. For the most
          part, the opening is dictated by the second ball response, and there
          are many more options available.
        
Response to East Boundary ball
Standard Tice

          The standard tice is one of the most popular responses to an east
          boundary ball at club-level croquet. Although in recent years it has
          fallen out of favour with top players (likely due to an increase in
          the standard of shooting), it is still a great opening that gives good
          chances to both sides.
        

          The standard tice is where red is played to the west boundary, and the
          distance it is placed north of C1 needs to be carefully considered by
          the striker or red. The name "tice" indicates that the distance should
          be enticing for the player of black to shoot at and so a distance of
          between about 8 and 13 yards is common. As a general rule, if possible
          the distance chosen should either be about 1 yard longer than the
          opponent's critical distance (the distance at which someone hits 50%
          of their shots) or 1 yard shorter (or equal to) your own critical
          distance. Obviously this cannot be achieved if your opponent has a
          longer critical distance than you do, so it is better to err slightly
          on the longer side.
        

          If blue is an in-lawn east boundary ball, laying a standard tice is
          risky, as black can quite easily lay a rush directly to it on the
          third turn.
        
C2 ball

          Probably the most common response to the east boundary ball today is
          the second-turn ball to 6" south of C2. The reason for playing just
          south of C2 is that if in the unlikely event of black shooting at red
          on turn 3, a miss will likely leave yellow a double target. The idea
          of red near C2 means that red is buried in a defensive position, and
          signals yellow's intent to shoot at blue and black on turn 4.
        

          If blue is slightly in-lawn, then C2 is the safest and most defensive
          response with red.
        
Duffer tice

          One of the more aggressive responses for red is the duffer tice. This
          is a ball that is placed usually about 2-feet north and a few inches
          east of penultimate. This is similarly enticing for the opponent to
          shoot (just as with a standard tice) but in this case a miss is
          usually more critical - any third turn shot at the duffer is in the
          direction of A baulk so black usually takes the shot gently - and by
          doing so is more likely to miss. Black missing leaves two balls in the
          centre of the court, giving yellow a great chance on turn 4. The
          duffer tice is a great option for weaker players playing against
          stronger players, and also for anyone confident in hitting 10 yarders.
        

          Between two very strong players a duffer tice is still a popular
          opening. There are variations on the placement of the ball near
          penult, based on the strength of the opponent. It is common to see a
          duffer tice placed level with, or south of, H6, particularly if the
          striker of red and yellow is a very good shot and is confident to hit
          an 11-yarder on turn 4. In a game between experts, the placement of
          red is sometimes moved to the west of H6 to discourage a third-turn
          break after a hit from black at blue.
        
C4 ball

          This option is very popular in New Zealand and although a mirror image
          of the C2 ball, is a lot more aggressive. Placing red 6" north of C4
          not only gives negligible break prospects to black on turn 3 but also
          signals your intent to hit fourth-turn with yellow and have a break. A
          miss at partner by black on turn 3 gives you a 13-yard shot for a
          4-ball break, and a miss by black at red on turn 3 usually gives a
          double target.
        
Shoot at first-turn ball

          A slightly counter-intuitive option but nonetheless an interesting
          one. Shooting red at blue on turn 2 and hitting gives no break
          prospects, but a miss also leaves very slim break prospects for black
          on turn 3 if it hits, unless black is a very strong player. With this
          opening it is quite common to see misses on both turns 2 and 3, and
          often a triple target for yellow at the other 3 balls on turn 4 from B
          baulk.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to east boundary opening
            


Response to Supershot ball

          The supershot ball is the most aggressive opening that the first-turn
          player can use. There are several responses to this which need to be
          considered, based on your assessment of your opponent's ability and
          whether the opponent has realistic prospects of a break to 4-back if
          they do manage to hit 3rd turn.
        
C2 response

          The C2 response is a ball played about 6" south of C2. This is a
          strong response to a supershot against almost all players. If the
          player of black wants to attempt a third-turn break, they will have to
          hit a 13-yarder and play a very difficult croquet stroke out of C2 to
          get a rush to H1, and this is by no means guaranteed. On the other
          hand, a miss by black at red on turn 3 will leave yellow a double
          target and a 4-ball break if hit.
        




              It is important to finish a few inches south of C2 with red as it
              will mean black missing on either side of it will leave a double
              target. Above is a comparison of yellow's target after a
              third-turn miss by black at red, firstly with red in C2 and
              secondly with red a few inches south of C2
            



          There are only a handful of players in the world where the C2 ball is
          not a great response - players who would expect to hit the 13 yarder
          most of the time and also be good enough at croquet strokes to expect
          to get a rush to H1 on the supershot ball. Against these players the
          strategy of lengthing the 3rd turn shot would be preferred.
        
C4 response

          Mirror image to the C2 response, this ball is played 6" north of C4.
          Consider this if blue (the supershot ball) is placed further north
          than normal (somewhere near peg-high), or is in a particular spot
          which may have H4 obscuring any croquet stroke from C4 towards it. It
          otherwise gives all the same advantages as the C2 response
        
Max Distance response

          As a counter to the very top players hitting the ball in C2 most of
          the time, the max distance response became popular - this is where red
          is played to the east boundary about level with the peg on the east
          boundary, leaving the longest shot possible for black. This response
          grants black a shot from C3 through red and into C4, reducing yellow's
          fourth-turn prospects - it relies more on black missing red than
          trying to make any break pick-up by black more difficult. Generally a
          good option against the very best players, but against most players is
          unnecessary.  
The reason why max distance on the east boundary is chosen instead of the equivalent max distance spot on the west boundary is that it is slightly further from the supershot ball (blue), which is slightly south-west of the peg.  Assuming that the shots on turns 3 and 4 are missed, blue's shot at red & yellow on the east boundary will be a couple of yards longer than the equivalent shot to the west boundary.  
Supershot lag

          The response for red to lag to a spot 3-4 yards east and 1-2 yards
          north of the supershot ball is a very strong and very under-used
          response to the supershot. This is a good tactic when playing someone
          who is a very good shot, and in particular if the supershot ball
          itself is quite deep (nearer the peg than H5). Placing red beside blue
          nullifies the strength of black's shooting by encouraging black to
          take its third turn shot gently (which is generally less accurate), or
          risk shooting hard and missing into B baulk, conceding a 4-ball break.
          In this case, black may choose not to shoot at all, and instead also
          lag to a position wide of the other two balls, meaning that red and
          yellow have successfully turned the tables of the supershot opening
          and enabled yellow to have the first attempted roquet.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to supershot opening
            


Roquet the Supershot ball

          The ultimate way to nullify the supershot ball - roquet it on the
          second turn. After roqueting blue with red, there are several options
          available. You can croquet blue towards C2 and then fire red off 6"
          north of C4. A more aggressive option would be to croquet blue
          north-west of H2 and fire red off the south boundary, south of H4 -
          this leaves black a choice of 7-8 yarders but minimal break prospects
          and difficult strokes with their third turn in order to distance the
          balls from baulk. A more novel option would be to crosswire blue and
          red at the peg, which leaves only a 17-yard shot for black with a
          baulk line in the background. An even more interesting option might be
          to roll blue close to the peg, either east or west, and then play red
          a yard or two away from it, wiring blue's backswing at red. This means
          that black probably has no lag option towards blue that doesn't leave
          a double-target for yellow.
        
Response to unusual first-turn options
Response to a first-turn C2 ball

          A first-turn C2 ball is an attempt by blue to make red conform to a
          defensive opening. Red could of course do this if it wants, by playing
          6" north of C4, or even by just having a "standard" east boundary
          ball; however a better option to negate blue's attempt at dictating
          the opening might be to set a duffer tice - this is the ultimate
          aggressive response to the C2 ball, and means that black is suddenly
          faced with having to hit a 10-13 yarder on turn 3 or risk leaving the
          same for yellow next turn, and a laid break.
        
Back to top



 Third
        Ball Options
      

        For the vast majority of players, if they manage to hit in on the third
        turn of the game, they will and should be looking to make a dream leave
        (see top of page) or similar, possibly with red near the peg and blue &
        black with a rush towards it. There are exceptions to this line of play,
        mainly with supershot openings, but unless otherwise stated, the
        standard play would be to try and set a dream leave.
      

Response to WB tice after EB opening

          Realistically, black will not be attempting to make any break on turn
          3 if it manages to hit in. The player of black has to make a judgement
          call on their likelihood of hitting the standard tice vs their
          opponent's likelihood of missing it.
        


            If the tice is long, the best response is probably to shoot black at
            blue from A baulk. Missing black at blue leaves the free shot at the
            tice for yellow of course, which does give yellow fairly good
            prospects if hit. If the tice is extremely long, say peg-high, then
            black could quite feasibly just lag at blue and attempt to leave a
            rush to red. Bear in mind that playing this lag so early in the game
            may be difficult as you may not have the pace of the court - and
            there is a risk that lagging at blue and falling short will leave
            yellow a double target on turn 4.
          

            Another option if black is uncertain, would be to shoot at blue from
            C3, and missing through to C4. This hedges black's bets somewhat, as
            it is still taking a shot at a ball and still somewhat joining with
            partner ball, but does not give good break prospects to the opponent
            if yellow hits, due to the proximity of blue and black to one
            another. Yellow is faced with a long takeoff from red towards blue
            and black and in all likelihood will not get a rush to H1 from this
            position.
          

            The third option is of course to shoot at the tice itself. Hitting
            red will give the opportunity to make a dream leave (as shown at the
            top of the page). Missing red will send black towards C2, which will
            give black a free shot back through red and yellow if yellow misses
            its fourth-turn shot at red.
          





              Some common third-ball responses to a standard tice
            


Response to C2 ball after EB opening

          There are two common options after a second-turn C2 ball - both
          consist of shooting at partner. If partner is hit, then usually the
          play will be to take off to the red in C2, roquet it and then croquet
          it either into the centre of the court, or along the west boundary,
          then lag back to partner and leave a rush in-court. However, consider
          a game where you are the stronger player playing a very capable weaker
          player, if you do hit partner third turn, you can elect to just set a
          rush to the C2 ball instead of trying to retrieve it from C2. As the
          stronger player you may prefer this line of play, instead of digging
          out the C2 ball only for your opponent to hit on turn 4 and have an
          easy break.
        

          Usually the third-turn shot at partner with black will be from A
          baulk, joining up on the east boundary if missed. This leaves a long
          double target for yellow from the end of B baulk. A more defensive
          play would be to shoot at partner from C3 into C4. Doing this leaves
          almost no break prospects fourth-turn for yellow but, depending on the
          distance between blue and black, may give them the opportunity to join
          up.
        

          Another option for black on turn 3 would be to shoot at red in C2 -
          however usually this is only a viable option if red is exactly in the
          corner, as it will mean that missing red on the right leaves no double
          target for yellow. Alternatively, another option would be for black to
          join up with red near C2, about 3-4 feet south of it. Doing so leaves
          no double target from B baulk and gives good break prospects to black
          if yellow misses the 13 yarder, although it must be remembered that
          yellow also has good prospects if it hits the 13 yarder. Black joining
          up with red also leaves a defensive shot for yellow at blue from C3 to
          C4 which, if missed, leaves black a very long and tricky takeoff from
          C2 to the east boundary.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a C2 ball
            


Response to C2 / C4 ball after Supershot opening

          The third-turn response to this option depends greatly on your ability
          and also the ability of your opponent. Before you lay the supershot,
          you need to ask yourself "am I realistically good enough to play a
          third-turn break to 4-back?". If the answer is no, then that does not
          mean that the supershot opening is a bad idea at all, but it just
          means that you may want to reassess your third-turn response.
          Additionally, if you are playing someone that you believe is much
          better than you are, then trying to give yourself a 4-ball break on
          turn 5 is exactly what you should be trying to achieve. Therefore,
          instead of trying to roquet the 13 yard shot of black at red just
          south of C2 (or just north of C4), you can instead look to join up
          with the ball 3-4 feet away, ensuring to leave no double target. This
          puts a great deal of pressure on your stronger opponent to then hit a
          13 yarder or else concede a 4-ball break to you.
        

          If you believe you are good enough to hit on turn 3 and play a break,
          then the answer is simple - hit red near C2 and go round.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / C2 ball
            


Response to EB ball after Supershot opening

          In most cases, the third-turn response to a max distance ball is to
          try and hit it from C3, missing into C4. Again, however, you should
          evaluate your own likelihood of playing a break to 4-back with only 3
          balls on the lawn if you hit, and so you may want to consider lagging
          to the ball, a couple of yards in-lawn from the east boundary.
        

          If the ball on the east boundary is south of the peg, it is tempting
          to simply shoot at it from A baulk. Missing will of course leave a
          double from B baulk, but the odds of yellow then hitting a double
          target from 20+ yards is no certainty. Alternatively, if the
          second-turn ball is around peg-high, then shooting at it from B baulk
          from a few yards west of C3 and missing often results in a fairly even
          spread of the balls, with your black ball being approximately 8 yards
          south of red and 8 yards north of C4. This again is technically a
          double target from somewhere on B Baulk, but given the distance
          between red and black, is easily missed and will leave your black ball
          a shot of only 8 yards.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / max distance
              ball
            


Response to C4 ball after EB opening

          This opening creates one of the more interesting third-turn decisions.
          A second-turn ball 6" north of C4 is a very threatening position and
          therefore the options will as follows:
        


            Shoot at partner
            
Hit - set a dream leave

                Miss - leaves yellow a 13-yard shot at red in C4 for a 4-ball
                break
              



            Shoot at opponent near C4 from A baulk
            

                Hit - set a dream leave (you may want to have a go at gaining a
                rush to H1 on partner)
              

                Miss - leave a 13-yard double for yellow (but slightly tricky
                break pick-up)
              



            Join up with opponent near C4, leaving no double
            

                If red is 3-6" north of C4 - join a yard north of it from A
                baulk
                
No short double target is left for yellow

                    Yellow still only has a 13-yard shot for the innings (but a
                    slightly tricky break pick-up)
                  



                If red is ~12" north of C4 - shoot from C3 through to C4
                

                    Enables black to have a shot (albeit very long) to attempt
                    to hit and set a dream leave
                  




Black to C2


              By burying itself in C2, this enables black to kill off the
              aggression by red and yellow. Any miss by yellow will leave a 9
              yarder (at most) for blue
            






              Some common third-ball responses to a C4 ball
            



          A personal preference of mine is to shoot third-turn at the ball near
          C4 from A baulk, because hitting gives me control of the court, and I
          miss often enough by more than several inches so as not to leave a
          double.
        

          Be on the lookout for cannons around C4 as part of this opening -
          there is often a good opportunity to bombard a live ball across to H1
          while playing a croquet stroke towards blue on the east boundary. This
          can make picking up the first break a great deal easier.
        
Response to duffer tice after EB opening

          The duffer tice is one of my favourite openings. Because of the
          placement of red near H6, a miss by black from the end of B baulk will
          be headed towards A baulk and give an easy start for yellow. That is
          why we see the ~9 yard shot at red refused so often, even by very
          strong players!
        

          If black does decide to shoot at the duffer and hits, then not a great
          deal of options are available other than to take off to partner ball
          (usually nudging red towards the peg in the process), and leave a rush
          towards red, and then hope for a fourth-turn miss by yellow.
        

          Another option for shooting at the duffer is doing so from C3,
          shooting across the court and missing to around peg-high (or just
          south of peg-high) on the west boundary. This is the most defensive
          shot available in that a miss gives no break to yellow if yellow hits
          red, but it also does not put any pressure on yellow's shot at red.
          Often times, when black misses the shot from C3 at red, it will end up
          south of peg-high on the west boundary and be a tempting free shot for
          yellow from C1.
        

          Shooting at partner ball on turn 3 is the most aggressive line of play
          - taking the shot from A baulk and hitting gives the opportunity to
          play a big croquet stroke loading partner to H2 and attempting to get
          a rush to H1 on the duffer ball - it is a big shot and the break
          chances are normally only reasonable for very strong players. Missing
          partner from A baulk on the other hand gives yellow a ~9 yard shot and
          very strong break prospects. It is therefore more usual to see black
          shoot at blue from C3 which, although longer, doesn't make all the
          balls available to yellow if black misses blue and yellow hits red. It
          also means that blue and black maintain a wide join and have realistic
          prospects of hitting back in if yellow misses red.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a duffer tice
            


Response to 2 balls on EB

          If red has shot at blue on turn 2 and missed, leaving both balls on
          the east boundary, you should carefully evaluate your response based
          on the strength of your opponent. If you and your opponent are evenly
          matched but not world class players, or especially if your opponent is
          a much stronger player than you, then the best thing to do here may be
          to simply ignore the two balls on the east boundary and lag black into
          the middle of the court and wait for yellow to miss. This potentially
          presents you with an immediate break with a ball in the middle of the
          court.
        

          In a match between two very strong players it would be unusual to see
          no shot taken on turn 3, and if hit, some attempt at digging out a
          3-ball break.
        
Response to 2 balls in-court

          In a situation where you have laid a supershot with blue, and red has
          lagged a couple of yards north east of your supershot ball, if there
          is no double target to be had from anywhere on the baulk lines, you
          must again consider your expectations after hitting third turn vs your
          opponent's likelihood of hitting fourth turn. As with previous
          options, if you are playing an opponent who on paper is a much
          stronger player, the percentage play is usually to lag the black ball
          into the middle of the court beside the other two balls (being mindful
          not to leave a double target from anywhere), which will put pressure
          on your stronger opponent to hit in or else concede the first break
          opportunity to you.
        

          If you do want to shoot with black at one of the balls in the middle,
          then consider either shooting at the easterly ball from C1 (you may
          even be able to shoot hard at this without missing to B baulk), or
          alternatively shooting at a medium pace at either blue or red from the
          closest point on A baulk. If you do shoot from the closest point, be
          sure to hit at a pace to finish slightly south of H6, both so that
          black is not a short shot from B baulk, and so that any double target
          that you leave has plenty of space between the front and back ball.
        

          If you are facing a third turn shot with black after red has
          cross-wired blue and red at the peg, check first to see if there is a
          point which you can lag to where blue won't be wired from black, and
          which won't be giving a double target from either baulk line - if
          there is such a spot, then that is the best place to lag to.

 Fourth Ball Options
      

The fourth-turn response is usually actually more simple than then third-turn response - although there are more possible scenarios, they almost always result in yellow trying to roquet something.  
      

Response to ignored WB tice
When black has ignored a standard west boundary tice and insetad shot at (and missed) partner on the east boundary, the obvious response is to then try and hit red yourself from C1.  If the placement of red is good, you should have ~50% chance of hitting in.  Your break prospects after hitting red are actually quite good, as you will play a take off from red to blue & black, which will automatically be sending red towards H2 as a pioneer.  On the other hand, a miss with yellow through red into C2 only gives fairly mediocre break prospects to blue & black in the next turn.
Response to missed WB tice
If black did indeed shoot at red (and miss) from C1 in the previous turn, then the obvious response is to shoot at red yourself, but from a point east of C1 so that a miss will leave yellow joined with red.  If you hit red, your best line of play would be to roll red &  yellow towards C1 and lay a rush for your next turn.  A miss from red at yellow will of course leave black a shot through red and yellow from C2 to C1 but is likely to be a very long shot at a single ball target.  A miss from black on turn 5 here also gives you a good chance at establishing a break on turn 5.  




              If black has missed the standard tice, it leaves a good opportunity to join up with red on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C2 ball after EB opening
Having played red into C2 on turn 2, if black ignores red and simply joins with blue (which is likely), then against most players your best line of play would be to shoot at blue and black with red.  Whether you shoot from A baulk or B baulk depends on factors such as the distance between blue and black (whether it is easy to make a double target from B baulk or A baulk) and the flatness of the east boundary.  If the black ball missed blue badly on the left on turn 3, blue and black may well be 2+ yards apart on the east boundary, so there is a defensive option available to yellow as well - shoot from C3 through to C4, where a miss would not give blue & black any easy opening.
If you are the weaker player against a very strong opponent, then there is a case for shooting yellow at red - at 13 yards, it is significantly shorter than any other available shot and is therefore your best chance at winning the opening.  Red missing yellow gives blue a relatively easy start and a probable break, but against a very strong opponent it can still be worth the risk.  




              Fourth-turn responses for yellow when partner is in C2 and opponent balls are on the east boundary.  
            


Response to joined / missed C2 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, if black has for some reason shot at red in C2, then assuming a double target has been left, your best aggressive option is to shoot at this, preferably hitting the northern ball, from B baulk.  A hit or a miss here will give fairly good break prospects to whomever plays the next shot, given C2's proximity to H2 - a semi-good pioneer can usually be sent to H2 while obtaining a rush to H1.
If black has instead joined up a yard south of red on turn 2, you have no double target (except from C1, but let's not consider that).  Now you have fundamentally two options - either shoot yellow at red which will give a good break opportunity if hit (and concede a good break opportunity to black if missed), or take a more defensive line by shooting yellow at blue from C3 into C4.  If yellow misses this shot, it does give black a 1-yard roquet at red for the innings, however it not only gives no break prospects, but also requires black to play several good strokes in order to have a good leave.  Black's take off from C2 to blue on the east boundary is a difficult shot, and if black doesn't succeed in roqueting blue in its next shot (either taking off short and missing blue, or taking off too far and sending black out) then yellow will have a 9-10 yard shot at blue & black from near C4.




              If black has joined a yard south of red near C2, the yellow has aggressive and defensive options available
            


Response to missed EB ball after Supershot opening
The response here depends a lot on both the length of the supershot ball and what option black chose on turn 3.  Firstly let's assume the most common scenario, with blue halfway between H5 and peg, and 1-2 yards west of the centre line, and red approximately peg high on the EB, and black in or near C4.  In this situation the best option is normally to shoot at red from A baulk, with a miss joining up around 1 yard north of it.  This leaves blue a 15-yarder at red & yellow but difficult break prospects for both players, whomever plays the next shot. 




              The common response after a third-turn miss by black at red to C4, is for yellow to shoot at red, joining if missing.  An aggressive line is to shoot at black.  A third option is yellow at blue, which is shorter and will win you the innings, but only gives good break prospects if red and black are near to each other
            


As the weaker player against a stronger player, a very aggressive line of play would be to shoot yellow from A baulk at black in C4 - this is very black and white, as a hit will give you a good chance for a 4-ball break and a miss will give black the same chance.  As the weaker player, you can strongly consider this option.  
Consider for a moment that black's third-turn shot missed red from A baulk, or perhaps missed red from west of C3, finishing 5-10 yards south of red.  In this case, yellow for look for possible double targets available from B baulk.  Consider, too, the shortest shot available, which is yellow at blue from A baulk - this is likely a 11-13 yard shot which, if hit, gives good break prospects to yellow because red and black are close together.
Response to ignored duffer tice
The vast majority of the time the best response to black ignoring red's duffer tice, is for yellow to shoot hard at red from B baulk.  Usually a duffer tice is only 9-10 yards and so it will be, by far, the shortest shot for yellow.




              The majority of the time, the fourth turn response would be to shoot yellow at the duffer.  Against a very strong player, you might be tempted by yellow at black in C4 which, although 3 yards longer, gives an easy start to your break
            


An expection to this would be if blue & black are joined on the east boundary leaving a good double target from A baulk, and so you may want to consider shooting at that instead.  Another option to consider is if black shot and missed blue from C3 to C4.  If you are playing against a much stronger opponent you may consider shooting yellow at black from A baulk into C4.  This shot is 3 yards longer than yellow at red from B baulk, but hitting this shot gives you vastly stronger break prospects than if you hit red first.
Response to missed duffer tice
If black misses the duffer tice (red) gently, the logical response is to shoot hard at either red from B baulk or black from A baulk (whichever is closer).  If black misses the duffer tice from C3 across to the west boundary, you may consider shooting at black from C1 through to C2, particularly if black is south of peg-high.  




              If the duffer tice is still in its original position at the start of turn 4, the general response is for yellow to shoot at red given its proximity to B baulk.  If black missed red from C3 however, it can be tempting to shoot at black from C1 on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C4 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, red a few inches north of C4 and black 1 yard north of blue, yellow's default response should be to shoot at red from A baulk.  Hitting this shot gives a great break opportunity, as it is a very natural stroke to croquet red to H2 while approaching blue & black up the east boundary.  
Response to 3 balls on EB
In this instance, you simply need to hit one of the balls on the east boundary - from either A baulk or B baulk, depending on length and available targets.
Response to 3 balls in-court
A supershot opening with lags by red and black essentially forces yellow to shoot at the closest ball.  A very black and white opening, good break prospects for both players on turn 4 or 5, depending on whether yellow hits or misses.  Often times, black will have take a gentle lag while attempting a roquet at either blue or red on turn 3, so this may also give yellow some target to shoot at on turn 4.

Conclusion
If you have gotten to the bottom of this article, you have probably realised by now that the number of opening options are vast.  This article could not hope to cover every eventuality, and nor does it present any new or unseen openings; rather it serves to talk through the options and thought processes for choosing a particular option, and I hope it has been useful.

Openings

        The opening is the battle between the two sides to be the first to gain
        the upper hand. Generally when we talk about openings in croquet, we are
        referring to the first 4 turns. At the very top level it is where games
        are won and lost, but at all levels it provides a fascinating array of
        options for bluffing and double-bluffing your opponent.
      
Opening priorities
As the stronger player

        The stronger player who is playing a dangerous but less experienced /
        weaker player will generally approach the opening with the intent of not
        giving away an easy break, and hence a more defensive mindset. Openings
        where there is a lot of grey area, balls on boundaries and in corners
        are best for this. The stronger player will generally rely on their
        better all-round game in order to win, and is more comfortable with
        digging balls out slowly into a break.
      
As the weaker player

        The weaker player should approach a game against a much stronger
        opponent with an attacking mindset - they will not be afraid to take on
        relatively short shots that give laid breaks, even if it means conceding
        a laid break if they miss. The weaker player should favour openings that
        have balls in-lawn and should be looking to put pressure on the stronger
        player to have to hit in.
      
Evenly-matched players

        It is quite common to see very aggressive, black and white, openings
        when two very strong players play against each other. The same is true
        for openings between evenly-matched players at lower levels, but
        generally to a lesser extent. A lot of the opening strategy depends on
        the individual mindset of the player, with some players naturally
        playing a more attacking game than others.
      

        Below are articles on various well-known (and some not-so-well-known)
        openings, which discuss options for placement of balls, and responses to
        them. For the purposes of simplicity, in the examples below, the balls
        will always be played in the following order:
      


 Blue
        

 Red
        


          Black
        


          Yellow
        


Note: there is no ball order or sequence in which the balls need to
          be added to the game in croquet - the above order is simply to keep
          things consistent for the diagrams and explanations.


        As you can probably imagine, the options in the opening are endless.
        This article attempts to talk through some of the most common options,
        and some of the most common responses to them, with the idea of
        clarifying some of the thought processes behind them.
      

The Dream Leave

        Many of the openings below will reference something known as the Dream
        Leave - this is a scenario where the third turn ball (black) has hit and
        arranged the court as follows:
      




            Black hit on turn 3 and set a dream leave
          



        Black has retrieved red from wherever it was on the court and placed it
        slightly in-lawn from the west boundary, north of peg-high, and left
        blue a rush to it from the east boundary. This leave gives no short shot
        for yellow, and any miss by yellow will give blue a good break
        opportunity.

 First
        Ball Options
      

East Boundary

          The most common option selected by the first ball player. A ball to
          the east boundary, somewhere between level with H4 and H5, is chosen
          due to its relative distance from both baulk lines and from H1. It is
          a completely non-threatening ball and allows the second ball player to
          dictate the nature of the game, be it defensive or aggressive.
        
In-lawn East Boundary ball

          A variation on the standard east boundary ball, the in-lawn east
          boundary ball is struck out in the same area as the standard east
          boundary ball, but purposefully left about 1 yard in from the yardline
          area. The idea behind that is so that black can play its third turn
          shot out behind blue and leave itself a rush in-court. This play
          discourages responses like a west boundary tice from red.
        
Supershot

          A supershot ball is a first-turn ball placed near the middle of the
          court, normally between H5 and peg and a couple of yards west of the
          centre line. This is the most aggressive sensible option for the first
          ball, and signals your intent to your opponent that you want no grey
          area. Given its proximity to H1, a supershot ball generally gives a
          good chance for a break for either player, depending on whether the
          third-turn, fourth-turn or fifth-turn shots are hit.
        

          There are variations on the length of the supershot, with a supershot
          played to near the peg being a poorer pioneer for H1 but having the
          advantage of lengthening any fourth-turn shot by yellow at it.
        
Anti-duffer

          This opening is an attempt to try and pre-empt the second-turn
          response and discourage a "duffer tice" by red. To lay an anti-duffer,
          you hit blue to a spot somewhere between H6 and the peg, and 1-2 yards
          west of the east boundary. The idea of placing a ball here is that if
          the opponent were to lay a duffer tice with red,
          then it gives black a good chance to hit red and take off behind blue
          for a rush to H1 on turn 3. It is a leave that is generally only used
          by strong players who have a realistic chance of a third-turn break in
          the first place.
        




              Some common first-ball scenarios
            


Unusual first-turn options

          The croquet court is a big place and so there really are endless
          options for where to place balls in the opening. Often an unusual
          option first-turn will yield good results by confusing the opponent!
        
C4 first ball

          Not often seen these days due to a preference for an east boundary
          ball 10 yards further north. A weakness of this opening is that
          shooting at partner on turn 3 and missing is liable to leave a double
          target for yellow. It also generally encourages yellow to take an
          aggressive shot on turn 4; however on a difficult lawn this opening
          can have some advantages, with any hit by yellow on turn 4 at balls in
          C4 leaving little room to promote balls into the court due to the
          close proximity to the corner.
        
C2 first ball

          Playing blue into C2 first turn can often catch the opponent off
          guard. This opening attempts to flip the tables on red and yellow by
          trying to ensure a defensive opening for blue and black. This can be a
          good option where blue and black are the stronger players and want to
          prevent aggressive second-turn options by red and yellow. Of course,
          there are options available to red and yellow which negate blue and
          black's defensive preferences.
        
Micro tice

          As unusual options go, this is right up there. This option would not
          be recommended when playing a strong player, but nevertheless is very
          interesting. The micro tice is a ball played from the end of A baulk
          towards the east boundary, but only 2-3 yards towards it, leaving a
          2-3 yard roquet for the opponent on the second turn. This length of
          shot cannot really be refused, but leaving red a croquet stroke from
          south-west of hoop 4 on the second turn of the game gives no real
          break prospects. Often the second turn player will attempt an approach
          to H1 and fail it, leaving a 6-yard roquet with two balls near H1 for
          black. This opening relies more on a tactical mistake from red than
          anything else
        
C1 / C3 opening

          Occasionally seen. Not a good opening against any experienced
          opponent, but occasionally yields results. This first-turn option is
          not to be recommended. A first-turn ball in C1 followed by a
          second-turn response to C3 (or vice versa) is a killer blow to black's
          turn.
        
Back to top




 Second
        Ball Options
      


          This is where things start to get a little interesting. For the most
          part, the opening is dictated by the second ball response, and there
          are many more options available.
        
Response to East Boundary ball
Standard Tice

          The standard tice is one of the most popular responses to an east
          boundary ball at club-level croquet. Although in recent years it has
          fallen out of favour with top players (likely due to an increase in
          the standard of shooting), it is still a great opening that gives good
          chances to both sides.
        

          The standard tice is where red is played to the west boundary, and the
          distance it is placed north of C1 needs to be carefully considered by
          the striker or red. The name "tice" indicates that the distance should
          be enticing for the player of black to shoot at and so a distance of
          between about 8 and 13 yards is common. As a general rule, if possible
          the distance chosen should either be about 1 yard longer than the
          opponent's critical distance (the distance at which someone hits 50%
          of their shots) or 1 yard shorter (or equal to) your own critical
          distance. Obviously this cannot be achieved if your opponent has a
          longer critical distance than you do, so it is better to err slightly
          on the longer side.
        

          If blue is an in-lawn east boundary ball, laying a standard tice is
          risky, as black can quite easily lay a rush directly to it on the
          third turn.
        
C2 ball

          Probably the most common response to the east boundary ball today is
          the second-turn ball to 6" south of C2. The reason for playing just
          south of C2 is that if in the unlikely event of black shooting at red
          on turn 3, a miss will likely leave yellow a double target. The idea
          of red near C2 means that red is buried in a defensive position, and
          signals yellow's intent to shoot at blue and black on turn 4.
        

          If blue is slightly in-lawn, then C2 is the safest and most defensive
          response with red.
        
Duffer tice

          One of the more aggressive responses for red is the duffer tice. This
          is a ball that is placed usually about 2-feet north and a few inches
          east of penultimate. This is similarly enticing for the opponent to
          shoot (just as with a standard tice) but in this case a miss is
          usually more critical - any third turn shot at the duffer is in the
          direction of A baulk so black usually takes the shot gently - and by
          doing so is more likely to miss. Black missing leaves two balls in the
          centre of the court, giving yellow a great chance on turn 4. The
          duffer tice is a great option for weaker players playing against
          stronger players, and also for anyone confident in hitting 10 yarders.
        

          Between two very strong players a duffer tice is still a popular
          opening. There are variations on the placement of the ball near
          penult, based on the strength of the opponent. It is common to see a
          duffer tice placed level with, or south of, H6, particularly if the
          striker of red and yellow is a very good shot and is confident to hit
          an 11-yarder on turn 4. In a game between experts, the placement of
          red is sometimes moved to the west of H6 to discourage a third-turn
          break after a hit from black at blue.
        
C4 ball

          This option is very popular in New Zealand and although a mirror image
          of the C2 ball, is a lot more aggressive. Placing red 6" north of C4
          not only gives negligible break prospects to black on turn 3 but also
          signals your intent to hit fourth-turn with yellow and have a break. A
          miss at partner by black on turn 3 gives you a 13-yard shot for a
          4-ball break, and a miss by black at red on turn 3 usually gives a
          double target.
        
Shoot at first-turn ball

          A slightly counter-intuitive option but nonetheless an interesting
          one. Shooting red at blue on turn 2 and hitting gives no break
          prospects, but a miss also leaves very slim break prospects for black
          on turn 3 if it hits, unless black is a very strong player. With this
          opening it is quite common to see misses on both turns 2 and 3, and
          often a triple target for yellow at the other 3 balls on turn 4 from B
          baulk.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to east boundary opening
            


Response to Supershot ball

          The supershot ball is the most aggressive opening that the first-turn
          player can use. There are several responses to this which need to be
          considered, based on your assessment of your opponent's ability and
          whether the opponent has realistic prospects of a break to 4-back if
          they do manage to hit 3rd turn.
        
C2 response

          The C2 response is a ball played about 6" south of C2. This is a
          strong response to a supershot against almost all players. If the
          player of black wants to attempt a third-turn break, they will have to
          hit a 13-yarder and play a very difficult croquet stroke out of C2 to
          get a rush to H1, and this is by no means guaranteed. On the other
          hand, a miss by black at red on turn 3 will leave yellow a double
          target and a 4-ball break if hit.
        




              It is important to finish a few inches south of C2 with red as it
              will mean black missing on either side of it will leave a double
              target. Above is a comparison of yellow's target after a
              third-turn miss by black at red, firstly with red in C2 and
              secondly with red a few inches south of C2
            



          There are only a handful of players in the world where the C2 ball is
          not a great response - players who would expect to hit the 13 yarder
          most of the time and also be good enough at croquet strokes to expect
          to get a rush to H1 on the supershot ball. Against these players the
          strategy of lengthing the 3rd turn shot would be preferred.
        
C4 response

          Mirror image to the C2 response, this ball is played 6" north of C4.
          Consider this if blue (the supershot ball) is placed further north
          than normal (somewhere near peg-high), or is in a particular spot
          which may have H4 obscuring any croquet stroke from C4 towards it. It
          otherwise gives all the same advantages as the C2 response
        
Max Distance response

          As a counter to the very top players hitting the ball in C2 most of
          the time, the max distance response became popular - this is where red
          is played to the east boundary about level with the peg on the east
          boundary, leaving the longest shot possible for black. This response
          grants black a shot from C3 through red and into C4, reducing yellow's
          fourth-turn prospects - it relies more on black missing red than
          trying to make any break pick-up by black more difficult. Generally a
          good option against the very best players, but against most players is
          unnecessary.  
The reason why max distance on the east boundary is chosen instead of the equivalent max distance spot on the west boundary is that it is slightly further from the supershot ball (blue), which is slightly south-west of the peg.  Assuming that the shots on turns 3 and 4 are missed, blue's shot at red & yellow on the east boundary will be a couple of yards longer than the equivalent shot to the west boundary.  
Supershot lag

          The response for red to lag to a spot 3-4 yards east and 1-2 yards
          north of the supershot ball is a very strong and very under-used
          response to the supershot. This is a good tactic when playing someone
          who is a very good shot, and in particular if the supershot ball
          itself is quite deep (nearer the peg than H5). Placing red beside blue
          nullifies the strength of black's shooting by encouraging black to
          take its third turn shot gently (which is generally less accurate), or
          risk shooting hard and missing into B baulk, conceding a 4-ball break.
          In this case, black may choose not to shoot at all, and instead also
          lag to a position wide of the other two balls, meaning that red and
          yellow have successfully turned the tables of the supershot opening
          and enabled yellow to have the first attempted roquet.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to supershot opening
            


Roquet the Supershot ball

          The ultimate way to nullify the supershot ball - roquet it on the
          second turn. After roqueting blue with red, there are several options
          available. You can croquet blue towards C2 and then fire red off 6"
          north of C4. A more aggressive option would be to croquet blue
          north-west of H2 and fire red off the south boundary, south of H4 -
          this leaves black a choice of 7-8 yarders but minimal break prospects
          and difficult strokes with their third turn in order to distance the
          balls from baulk. A more novel option would be to crosswire blue and
          red at the peg, which leaves only a 17-yard shot for black with a
          baulk line in the background. An even more interesting option might be
          to roll blue close to the peg, either east or west, and then play red
          a yard or two away from it, wiring blue's backswing at red. This means
          that black probably has no lag option towards blue that doesn't leave
          a double-target for yellow.
        
Response to unusual first-turn options
Response to a first-turn C2 ball

          A first-turn C2 ball is an attempt by blue to make red conform to a
          defensive opening. Red could of course do this if it wants, by playing
          6" north of C4, or even by just having a "standard" east boundary
          ball; however a better option to negate blue's attempt at dictating
          the opening might be to set a duffer tice - this is the ultimate
          aggressive response to the C2 ball, and means that black is suddenly
          faced with having to hit a 10-13 yarder on turn 3 or risk leaving the
          same for yellow next turn, and a laid break.
        
Back to top



 Third
        Ball Options
      

        For the vast majority of players, if they manage to hit in on the third
        turn of the game, they will and should be looking to make a dream leave
        (see top of page) or similar, possibly with red near the peg and blue &
        black with a rush towards it. There are exceptions to this line of play,
        mainly with supershot openings, but unless otherwise stated, the
        standard play would be to try and set a dream leave.
      

Response to WB tice after EB opening

          Realistically, black will not be attempting to make any break on turn
          3 if it manages to hit in. The player of black has to make a judgement
          call on their likelihood of hitting the standard tice vs their
          opponent's likelihood of missing it.
        


            If the tice is long, the best response is probably to shoot black at
            blue from A baulk. Missing black at blue leaves the free shot at the
            tice for yellow of course, which does give yellow fairly good
            prospects if hit. If the tice is extremely long, say peg-high, then
            black could quite feasibly just lag at blue and attempt to leave a
            rush to red. Bear in mind that playing this lag so early in the game
            may be difficult as you may not have the pace of the court - and
            there is a risk that lagging at blue and falling short will leave
            yellow a double target on turn 4.
          

            Another option if black is uncertain, would be to shoot at blue from
            C3, and missing through to C4. This hedges black's bets somewhat, as
            it is still taking a shot at a ball and still somewhat joining with
            partner ball, but does not give good break prospects to the opponent
            if yellow hits, due to the proximity of blue and black to one
            another. Yellow is faced with a long takeoff from red towards blue
            and black and in all likelihood will not get a rush to H1 from this
            position.
          

            The third option is of course to shoot at the tice itself. Hitting
            red will give the opportunity to make a dream leave (as shown at the
            top of the page). Missing red will send black towards C2, which will
            give black a free shot back through red and yellow if yellow misses
            its fourth-turn shot at red.
          





              Some common third-ball responses to a standard tice
            


Response to C2 ball after EB opening

          There are two common options after a second-turn C2 ball - both
          consist of shooting at partner. If partner is hit, then usually the
          play will be to take off to the red in C2, roquet it and then croquet
          it either into the centre of the court, or along the west boundary,
          then lag back to partner and leave a rush in-court. However, consider
          a game where you are the stronger player playing a very capable weaker
          player, if you do hit partner third turn, you can elect to just set a
          rush to the C2 ball instead of trying to retrieve it from C2. As the
          stronger player you may prefer this line of play, instead of digging
          out the C2 ball only for your opponent to hit on turn 4 and have an
          easy break.
        

          Usually the third-turn shot at partner with black will be from A
          baulk, joining up on the east boundary if missed. This leaves a long
          double target for yellow from the end of B baulk. A more defensive
          play would be to shoot at partner from C3 into C4. Doing this leaves
          almost no break prospects fourth-turn for yellow but, depending on the
          distance between blue and black, may give them the opportunity to join
          up.
        

          Another option for black on turn 3 would be to shoot at red in C2 -
          however usually this is only a viable option if red is exactly in the
          corner, as it will mean that missing red on the right leaves no double
          target for yellow. Alternatively, another option would be for black to
          join up with red near C2, about 3-4 feet south of it. Doing so leaves
          no double target from B baulk and gives good break prospects to black
          if yellow misses the 13 yarder, although it must be remembered that
          yellow also has good prospects if it hits the 13 yarder. Black joining
          up with red also leaves a defensive shot for yellow at blue from C3 to
          C4 which, if missed, leaves black a very long and tricky takeoff from
          C2 to the east boundary.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a C2 ball
            


Response to C2 / C4 ball after Supershot opening

          The third-turn response to this option depends greatly on your ability
          and also the ability of your opponent. Before you lay the supershot,
          you need to ask yourself "am I realistically good enough to play a
          third-turn break to 4-back?". If the answer is no, then that does not
          mean that the supershot opening is a bad idea at all, but it just
          means that you may want to reassess your third-turn response.
          Additionally, if you are playing someone that you believe is much
          better than you are, then trying to give yourself a 4-ball break on
          turn 5 is exactly what you should be trying to achieve. Therefore,
          instead of trying to roquet the 13 yard shot of black at red just
          south of C2 (or just north of C4), you can instead look to join up
          with the ball 3-4 feet away, ensuring to leave no double target. This
          puts a great deal of pressure on your stronger opponent to then hit a
          13 yarder or else concede a 4-ball break to you.
        

          If you believe you are good enough to hit on turn 3 and play a break,
          then the answer is simple - hit red near C2 and go round.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / C2 ball
            


Response to EB ball after Supershot opening

          In most cases, the third-turn response to a max distance ball is to
          try and hit it from C3, missing into C4. Again, however, you should
          evaluate your own likelihood of playing a break to 4-back with only 3
          balls on the lawn if you hit, and so you may want to consider lagging
          to the ball, a couple of yards in-lawn from the east boundary.
        

          If the ball on the east boundary is south of the peg, it is tempting
          to simply shoot at it from A baulk. Missing will of course leave a
          double from B baulk, but the odds of yellow then hitting a double
          target from 20+ yards is no certainty. Alternatively, if the
          second-turn ball is around peg-high, then shooting at it from B baulk
          from a few yards west of C3 and missing often results in a fairly even
          spread of the balls, with your black ball being approximately 8 yards
          south of red and 8 yards north of C4. This again is technically a
          double target from somewhere on B Baulk, but given the distance
          between red and black, is easily missed and will leave your black ball
          a shot of only 8 yards.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / max distance
              ball
            


Response to C4 ball after EB opening

          This opening creates one of the more interesting third-turn decisions.
          A second-turn ball 6" north of C4 is a very threatening position and
          therefore the options will as follows:
        


            Shoot at partner
            
Hit - set a dream leave

                Miss - leaves yellow a 13-yard shot at red in C4 for a 4-ball
                break
              



            Shoot at opponent near C4 from A baulk
            

                Hit - set a dream leave (you may want to have a go at gaining a
                rush to H1 on partner)
              

                Miss - leave a 13-yard double for yellow (but slightly tricky
                break pick-up)
              



            Join up with opponent near C4, leaving no double
            

                If red is 3-6" north of C4 - join a yard north of it from A
                baulk
                
No short double target is left for yellow

                    Yellow still only has a 13-yard shot for the innings (but a
                    slightly tricky break pick-up)
                  



                If red is ~12" north of C4 - shoot from C3 through to C4
                

                    Enables black to have a shot (albeit very long) to attempt
                    to hit and set a dream leave
                  




Black to C2


              By burying itself in C2, this enables black to kill off the
              aggression by red and yellow. Any miss by yellow will leave a 9
              yarder (at most) for blue
            






              Some common third-ball responses to a C4 ball
            



          A personal preference of mine is to shoot third-turn at the ball near
          C4 from A baulk, because hitting gives me control of the court, and I
          miss often enough by more than several inches so as not to leave a
          double.
        

          Be on the lookout for cannons around C4 as part of this opening -
          there is often a good opportunity to bombard a live ball across to H1
          while playing a croquet stroke towards blue on the east boundary. This
          can make picking up the first break a great deal easier.
        
Response to duffer tice after EB opening

          The duffer tice is one of my favourite openings. Because of the
          placement of red near H6, a miss by black from the end of B baulk will
          be headed towards A baulk and give an easy start for yellow. That is
          why we see the ~9 yard shot at red refused so often, even by very
          strong players!
        

          If black does decide to shoot at the duffer and hits, then not a great
          deal of options are available other than to take off to partner ball
          (usually nudging red towards the peg in the process), and leave a rush
          towards red, and then hope for a fourth-turn miss by yellow.
        

          Another option for shooting at the duffer is doing so from C3,
          shooting across the court and missing to around peg-high (or just
          south of peg-high) on the west boundary. This is the most defensive
          shot available in that a miss gives no break to yellow if yellow hits
          red, but it also does not put any pressure on yellow's shot at red.
          Often times, when black misses the shot from C3 at red, it will end up
          south of peg-high on the west boundary and be a tempting free shot for
          yellow from C1.
        

          Shooting at partner ball on turn 3 is the most aggressive line of play
          - taking the shot from A baulk and hitting gives the opportunity to
          play a big croquet stroke loading partner to H2 and attempting to get
          a rush to H1 on the duffer ball - it is a big shot and the break
          chances are normally only reasonable for very strong players. Missing
          partner from A baulk on the other hand gives yellow a ~9 yard shot and
          very strong break prospects. It is therefore more usual to see black
          shoot at blue from C3 which, although longer, doesn't make all the
          balls available to yellow if black misses blue and yellow hits red. It
          also means that blue and black maintain a wide join and have realistic
          prospects of hitting back in if yellow misses red.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a duffer tice
            


Response to 2 balls on EB

          If red has shot at blue on turn 2 and missed, leaving both balls on
          the east boundary, you should carefully evaluate your response based
          on the strength of your opponent. If you and your opponent are evenly
          matched but not world class players, or especially if your opponent is
          a much stronger player than you, then the best thing to do here may be
          to simply ignore the two balls on the east boundary and lag black into
          the middle of the court and wait for yellow to miss. This potentially
          presents you with an immediate break with a ball in the middle of the
          court.
        

          In a match between two very strong players it would be unusual to see
          no shot taken on turn 3, and if hit, some attempt at digging out a
          3-ball break.
        
Response to 2 balls in-court

          In a situation where you have laid a supershot with blue, and red has
          lagged a couple of yards north east of your supershot ball, if there
          is no double target to be had from anywhere on the baulk lines, you
          must again consider your expectations after hitting third turn vs your
          opponent's likelihood of hitting fourth turn. As with previous
          options, if you are playing an opponent who on paper is a much
          stronger player, the percentage play is usually to lag the black ball
          into the middle of the court beside the other two balls (being mindful
          not to leave a double target from anywhere), which will put pressure
          on your stronger opponent to hit in or else concede the first break
          opportunity to you.
        

          If you do want to shoot with black at one of the balls in the middle,
          then consider either shooting at the easterly ball from C1 (you may
          even be able to shoot hard at this without missing to B baulk), or
          alternatively shooting at a medium pace at either blue or red from the
          closest point on A baulk. If you do shoot from the closest point, be
          sure to hit at a pace to finish slightly south of H6, both so that
          black is not a short shot from B baulk, and so that any double target
          that you leave has plenty of space between the front and back ball.
        

          If you are facing a third turn shot with black after red has
          cross-wired blue and red at the peg, check first to see if there is a
          point which you can lag to where blue won't be wired from black, and
          which won't be giving a double target from either baulk line - if
          there is such a spot, then that is the best place to lag to.

 Fourth Ball Options
      

The fourth-turn response is usually actually more simple than then third-turn response - although there are more possible scenarios, they almost always result in yellow trying to roquet something.  
      

Response to ignored WB tice
When black has ignored a standard west boundary tice and insetad shot at (and missed) partner on the east boundary, the obvious response is to then try and hit red yourself from C1.  If the placement of red is good, you should have ~50% chance of hitting in.  Your break prospects after hitting red are actually quite good, as you will play a take off from red to blue & black, which will automatically be sending red towards H2 as a pioneer.  On the other hand, a miss with yellow through red into C2 only gives fairly mediocre break prospects to blue & black in the next turn.
Response to missed WB tice
If black did indeed shoot at red (and miss) from C1 in the previous turn, then the obvious response is to shoot at red yourself, but from a point east of C1 so that a miss will leave yellow joined with red.  If you hit red, your best line of play would be to roll red &  yellow towards C1 and lay a rush for your next turn.  A miss from red at yellow will of course leave black a shot through red and yellow from C2 to C1 but is likely to be a very long shot at a single ball target.  A miss from black on turn 5 here also gives you a good chance at establishing a break on turn 5.  




              If black has missed the standard tice, it leaves a good opportunity to join up with red on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C2 ball after EB opening
Having played red into C2 on turn 2, if black ignores red and simply joins with blue (which is likely), then against most players your best line of play would be to shoot at blue and black with red.  Whether you shoot from A baulk or B baulk depends on factors such as the distance between blue and black (whether it is easy to make a double target from B baulk or A baulk) and the flatness of the east boundary.  If the black ball missed blue badly on the left on turn 3, blue and black may well be 2+ yards apart on the east boundary, so there is a defensive option available to yellow as well - shoot from C3 through to C4, where a miss would not give blue & black any easy opening.
If you are the weaker player against a very strong opponent, then there is a case for shooting yellow at red - at 13 yards, it is significantly shorter than any other available shot and is therefore your best chance at winning the opening.  Red missing yellow gives blue a relatively easy start and a probable break, but against a very strong opponent it can still be worth the risk.  




              Fourth-turn responses for yellow when partner is in C2 and opponent balls are on the east boundary.  
            


Response to joined / missed C2 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, if black has for some reason shot at red in C2, then assuming a double target has been left, your best aggressive option is to shoot at this, preferably hitting the northern ball, from B baulk.  A hit or a miss here will give fairly good break prospects to whomever plays the next shot, given C2's proximity to H2 - a semi-good pioneer can usually be sent to H2 while obtaining a rush to H1.
If black has instead joined up a yard south of red on turn 2, you have no double target (except from C1, but let's not consider that).  Now you have fundamentally two options - either shoot yellow at red which will give a good break opportunity if hit (and concede a good break opportunity to black if missed), or take a more defensive line by shooting yellow at blue from C3 into C4.  If yellow misses this shot, it does give black a 1-yard roquet at red for the innings, however it not only gives no break prospects, but also requires black to play several good strokes in order to have a good leave.  Black's take off from C2 to blue on the east boundary is a difficult shot, and if black doesn't succeed in roqueting blue in its next shot (either taking off short and missing blue, or taking off too far and sending black out) then yellow will have a 9-10 yard shot at blue & black from near C4.




              If black has joined a yard south of red near C2, the yellow has aggressive and defensive options available
            


Response to missed EB ball after Supershot opening
The response here depends a lot on both the length of the supershot ball and what option black chose on turn 3.  Firstly let's assume the most common scenario, with blue halfway between H5 and peg, and 1-2 yards west of the centre line, and red approximately peg high on the EB, and black in or near C4.  In this situation the best option is normally to shoot at red from A baulk, with a miss joining up around 1 yard north of it.  This leaves blue a 15-yarder at red & yellow but difficult break prospects for both players, whomever plays the next shot. 




              The common response after a third-turn miss by black at red to C4, is for yellow to shoot at red, joining if missing.  An aggressive line is to shoot at black.  A third option is yellow at blue, which is shorter and will win you the innings, but only gives good break prospects if red and black are near to each other
            


As the weaker player against a stronger player, a very aggressive line of play would be to shoot yellow from A baulk at black in C4 - this is very black and white, as a hit will give you a good chance for a 4-ball break and a miss will give black the same chance.  As the weaker player, you can strongly consider this option.  
Consider for a moment that black's third-turn shot missed red from A baulk, or perhaps missed red from west of C3, finishing 5-10 yards south of red.  In this case, yellow for look for possible double targets available from B baulk.  Consider, too, the shortest shot available, which is yellow at blue from A baulk - this is likely a 11-13 yard shot which, if hit, gives good break prospects to yellow because red and black are close together.
Response to ignored duffer tice
The vast majority of the time the best response to black ignoring red's duffer tice, is for yellow to shoot hard at red from B baulk.  Usually a duffer tice is only 9-10 yards and so it will be, by far, the shortest shot for yellow.




              The majority of the time, the fourth turn response would be to shoot yellow at the duffer.  Against a very strong player, you might be tempted by yellow at black in C4 which, although 3 yards longer, gives an easy start to your break
            


An expection to this would be if blue & black are joined on the east boundary leaving a good double target from A baulk, and so you may want to consider shooting at that instead.  Another option to consider is if black shot and missed blue from C3 to C4.  If you are playing against a much stronger opponent you may consider shooting yellow at black from A baulk into C4.  This shot is 3 yards longer than yellow at red from B baulk, but hitting this shot gives you vastly stronger break prospects than if you hit red first.
Response to missed duffer tice
If black misses the duffer tice (red) gently, the logical response is to shoot hard at either red from B baulk or black from A baulk (whichever is closer).  If black misses the duffer tice from C3 across to the west boundary, you may consider shooting at black from C1 through to C2, particularly if black is south of peg-high.  




              If the duffer tice is still in its original position at the start of turn 4, the general response is for yellow to shoot at red given its proximity to B baulk.  If black missed red from C3 however, it can be tempting to shoot at black from C1 on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C4 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, red a few inches north of C4 and black 1 yard north of blue, yellow's default response should be to shoot at red from A baulk.  Hitting this shot gives a great break opportunity, as it is a very natural stroke to croquet red to H2 while approaching blue & black up the east boundary.  
Response to 3 balls on EB
In this instance, you simply need to hit one of the balls on the east boundary - from either A baulk or B baulk, depending on length and available targets.
Response to 3 balls in-court
A supershot opening with lags by red and black essentially forces yellow to shoot at the closest ball.  A very black and white opening, good break prospects for both players on turn 4 or 5, depending on whether yellow hits or misses.  Often times, black will have take a gentle lag while attempting a roquet at either blue or red on turn 3, so this may also give yellow some target to shoot at on turn 4.

Conclusion
If you have gotten to the bottom of this article, you have probably realised by now that the number of opening options are vast.  This article could not hope to cover every eventuality, and nor does it present any new or unseen openings; rather it serves to talk through the options and thought processes for choosing a particular option, and I hope it has been useful.

Openings

        The opening is the battle between the two sides to be the first to gain
        the upper hand. Generally when we talk about openings in croquet, we are
        referring to the first 4 turns. At the very top level it is where games
        are won and lost, but at all levels it provides a fascinating array of
        options for bluffing and double-bluffing your opponent.
      
Opening priorities
As the stronger player

        The stronger player who is playing a dangerous but less experienced /
        weaker player will generally approach the opening with the intent of not
        giving away an easy break, and hence a more defensive mindset. Openings
        where there is a lot of grey area, balls on boundaries and in corners
        are best for this. The stronger player will generally rely on their
        better all-round game in order to win, and is more comfortable with
        digging balls out slowly into a break.
      
As the weaker player

        The weaker player should approach a game against a much stronger
        opponent with an attacking mindset - they will not be afraid to take on
        relatively short shots that give laid breaks, even if it means conceding
        a laid break if they miss. The weaker player should favour openings that
        have balls in-lawn and should be looking to put pressure on the stronger
        player to have to hit in.
      
Evenly-matched players

        It is quite common to see very aggressive, black and white, openings
        when two very strong players play against each other. The same is true
        for openings between evenly-matched players at lower levels, but
        generally to a lesser extent. A lot of the opening strategy depends on
        the individual mindset of the player, with some players naturally
        playing a more attacking game than others.
      

        Below are articles on various well-known (and some not-so-well-known)
        openings, which discuss options for placement of balls, and responses to
        them. For the purposes of simplicity, in the examples below, the balls
        will always be played in the following order:
      


 Blue
        

 Red
        


          Black
        


          Yellow
        


Note: there is no ball order or sequence in which the balls need to
          be added to the game in croquet - the above order is simply to keep
          things consistent for the diagrams and explanations.


        As you can probably imagine, the options in the opening are endless.
        This article attempts to talk through some of the most common options,
        and some of the most common responses to them, with the idea of
        clarifying some of the thought processes behind them.
      

The Dream Leave

        Many of the openings below will reference something known as the Dream
        Leave - this is a scenario where the third turn ball (black) has hit and
        arranged the court as follows:
      




            Black hit on turn 3 and set a dream leave
          



        Black has retrieved red from wherever it was on the court and placed it
        slightly in-lawn from the west boundary, north of peg-high, and left
        blue a rush to it from the east boundary. This leave gives no short shot
        for yellow, and any miss by yellow will give blue a good break
        opportunity.

 First
        Ball Options
      

East Boundary

          The most common option selected by the first ball player. A ball to
          the east boundary, somewhere between level with H4 and H5, is chosen
          due to its relative distance from both baulk lines and from H1. It is
          a completely non-threatening ball and allows the second ball player to
          dictate the nature of the game, be it defensive or aggressive.
        
In-lawn East Boundary ball

          A variation on the standard east boundary ball, the in-lawn east
          boundary ball is struck out in the same area as the standard east
          boundary ball, but purposefully left about 1 yard in from the yardline
          area. The idea behind that is so that black can play its third turn
          shot out behind blue and leave itself a rush in-court. This play
          discourages responses like a west boundary tice from red.
        
Supershot

          A supershot ball is a first-turn ball placed near the middle of the
          court, normally between H5 and peg and a couple of yards west of the
          centre line. This is the most aggressive sensible option for the first
          ball, and signals your intent to your opponent that you want no grey
          area. Given its proximity to H1, a supershot ball generally gives a
          good chance for a break for either player, depending on whether the
          third-turn, fourth-turn or fifth-turn shots are hit.
        

          There are variations on the length of the supershot, with a supershot
          played to near the peg being a poorer pioneer for H1 but having the
          advantage of lengthening any fourth-turn shot by yellow at it.
        
Anti-duffer

          This opening is an attempt to try and pre-empt the second-turn
          response and discourage a "duffer tice" by red. To lay an anti-duffer,
          you hit blue to a spot somewhere between H6 and the peg, and 1-2 yards
          west of the east boundary. The idea of placing a ball here is that if
          the opponent were to lay a duffer tice with red,
          then it gives black a good chance to hit red and take off behind blue
          for a rush to H1 on turn 3. It is a leave that is generally only used
          by strong players who have a realistic chance of a third-turn break in
          the first place.
        




              Some common first-ball scenarios
            


Unusual first-turn options

          The croquet court is a big place and so there really are endless
          options for where to place balls in the opening. Often an unusual
          option first-turn will yield good results by confusing the opponent!
        
C4 first ball

          Not often seen these days due to a preference for an east boundary
          ball 10 yards further north. A weakness of this opening is that
          shooting at partner on turn 3 and missing is liable to leave a double
          target for yellow. It also generally encourages yellow to take an
          aggressive shot on turn 4; however on a difficult lawn this opening
          can have some advantages, with any hit by yellow on turn 4 at balls in
          C4 leaving little room to promote balls into the court due to the
          close proximity to the corner.
        
C2 first ball

          Playing blue into C2 first turn can often catch the opponent off
          guard. This opening attempts to flip the tables on red and yellow by
          trying to ensure a defensive opening for blue and black. This can be a
          good option where blue and black are the stronger players and want to
          prevent aggressive second-turn options by red and yellow. Of course,
          there are options available to red and yellow which negate blue and
          black's defensive preferences.
        
Micro tice

          As unusual options go, this is right up there. This option would not
          be recommended when playing a strong player, but nevertheless is very
          interesting. The micro tice is a ball played from the end of A baulk
          towards the east boundary, but only 2-3 yards towards it, leaving a
          2-3 yard roquet for the opponent on the second turn. This length of
          shot cannot really be refused, but leaving red a croquet stroke from
          south-west of hoop 4 on the second turn of the game gives no real
          break prospects. Often the second turn player will attempt an approach
          to H1 and fail it, leaving a 6-yard roquet with two balls near H1 for
          black. This opening relies more on a tactical mistake from red than
          anything else
        
C1 / C3 opening

          Occasionally seen. Not a good opening against any experienced
          opponent, but occasionally yields results. This first-turn option is
          not to be recommended. A first-turn ball in C1 followed by a
          second-turn response to C3 (or vice versa) is a killer blow to black's
          turn.
        
Back to top




 Second
        Ball Options
      


          This is where things start to get a little interesting. For the most
          part, the opening is dictated by the second ball response, and there
          are many more options available.
        
Response to East Boundary ball
Standard Tice

          The standard tice is one of the most popular responses to an east
          boundary ball at club-level croquet. Although in recent years it has
          fallen out of favour with top players (likely due to an increase in
          the standard of shooting), it is still a great opening that gives good
          chances to both sides.
        

          The standard tice is where red is played to the west boundary, and the
          distance it is placed north of C1 needs to be carefully considered by
          the striker or red. The name "tice" indicates that the distance should
          be enticing for the player of black to shoot at and so a distance of
          between about 8 and 13 yards is common. As a general rule, if possible
          the distance chosen should either be about 1 yard longer than the
          opponent's critical distance (the distance at which someone hits 50%
          of their shots) or 1 yard shorter (or equal to) your own critical
          distance. Obviously this cannot be achieved if your opponent has a
          longer critical distance than you do, so it is better to err slightly
          on the longer side.
        

          If blue is an in-lawn east boundary ball, laying a standard tice is
          risky, as black can quite easily lay a rush directly to it on the
          third turn.
        
C2 ball

          Probably the most common response to the east boundary ball today is
          the second-turn ball to 6" south of C2. The reason for playing just
          south of C2 is that if in the unlikely event of black shooting at red
          on turn 3, a miss will likely leave yellow a double target. The idea
          of red near C2 means that red is buried in a defensive position, and
          signals yellow's intent to shoot at blue and black on turn 4.
        

          If blue is slightly in-lawn, then C2 is the safest and most defensive
          response with red.
        
Duffer tice

          One of the more aggressive responses for red is the duffer tice. This
          is a ball that is placed usually about 2-feet north and a few inches
          east of penultimate. This is similarly enticing for the opponent to
          shoot (just as with a standard tice) but in this case a miss is
          usually more critical - any third turn shot at the duffer is in the
          direction of A baulk so black usually takes the shot gently - and by
          doing so is more likely to miss. Black missing leaves two balls in the
          centre of the court, giving yellow a great chance on turn 4. The
          duffer tice is a great option for weaker players playing against
          stronger players, and also for anyone confident in hitting 10 yarders.
        

          Between two very strong players a duffer tice is still a popular
          opening. There are variations on the placement of the ball near
          penult, based on the strength of the opponent. It is common to see a
          duffer tice placed level with, or south of, H6, particularly if the
          striker of red and yellow is a very good shot and is confident to hit
          an 11-yarder on turn 4. In a game between experts, the placement of
          red is sometimes moved to the west of H6 to discourage a third-turn
          break after a hit from black at blue.
        
C4 ball

          This option is very popular in New Zealand and although a mirror image
          of the C2 ball, is a lot more aggressive. Placing red 6" north of C4
          not only gives negligible break prospects to black on turn 3 but also
          signals your intent to hit fourth-turn with yellow and have a break. A
          miss at partner by black on turn 3 gives you a 13-yard shot for a
          4-ball break, and a miss by black at red on turn 3 usually gives a
          double target.
        
Shoot at first-turn ball

          A slightly counter-intuitive option but nonetheless an interesting
          one. Shooting red at blue on turn 2 and hitting gives no break
          prospects, but a miss also leaves very slim break prospects for black
          on turn 3 if it hits, unless black is a very strong player. With this
          opening it is quite common to see misses on both turns 2 and 3, and
          often a triple target for yellow at the other 3 balls on turn 4 from B
          baulk.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to east boundary opening
            


Response to Supershot ball

          The supershot ball is the most aggressive opening that the first-turn
          player can use. There are several responses to this which need to be
          considered, based on your assessment of your opponent's ability and
          whether the opponent has realistic prospects of a break to 4-back if
          they do manage to hit 3rd turn.
        
C2 response

          The C2 response is a ball played about 6" south of C2. This is a
          strong response to a supershot against almost all players. If the
          player of black wants to attempt a third-turn break, they will have to
          hit a 13-yarder and play a very difficult croquet stroke out of C2 to
          get a rush to H1, and this is by no means guaranteed. On the other
          hand, a miss by black at red on turn 3 will leave yellow a double
          target and a 4-ball break if hit.
        




              It is important to finish a few inches south of C2 with red as it
              will mean black missing on either side of it will leave a double
              target. Above is a comparison of yellow's target after a
              third-turn miss by black at red, firstly with red in C2 and
              secondly with red a few inches south of C2
            



          There are only a handful of players in the world where the C2 ball is
          not a great response - players who would expect to hit the 13 yarder
          most of the time and also be good enough at croquet strokes to expect
          to get a rush to H1 on the supershot ball. Against these players the
          strategy of lengthing the 3rd turn shot would be preferred.
        
C4 response

          Mirror image to the C2 response, this ball is played 6" north of C4.
          Consider this if blue (the supershot ball) is placed further north
          than normal (somewhere near peg-high), or is in a particular spot
          which may have H4 obscuring any croquet stroke from C4 towards it. It
          otherwise gives all the same advantages as the C2 response
        
Max Distance response

          As a counter to the very top players hitting the ball in C2 most of
          the time, the max distance response became popular - this is where red
          is played to the east boundary about level with the peg on the east
          boundary, leaving the longest shot possible for black. This response
          grants black a shot from C3 through red and into C4, reducing yellow's
          fourth-turn prospects - it relies more on black missing red than
          trying to make any break pick-up by black more difficult. Generally a
          good option against the very best players, but against most players is
          unnecessary.  
The reason why max distance on the east boundary is chosen instead of the equivalent max distance spot on the west boundary is that it is slightly further from the supershot ball (blue), which is slightly south-west of the peg.  Assuming that the shots on turns 3 and 4 are missed, blue's shot at red & yellow on the east boundary will be a couple of yards longer than the equivalent shot to the west boundary.  
Supershot lag

          The response for red to lag to a spot 3-4 yards east and 1-2 yards
          north of the supershot ball is a very strong and very under-used
          response to the supershot. This is a good tactic when playing someone
          who is a very good shot, and in particular if the supershot ball
          itself is quite deep (nearer the peg than H5). Placing red beside blue
          nullifies the strength of black's shooting by encouraging black to
          take its third turn shot gently (which is generally less accurate), or
          risk shooting hard and missing into B baulk, conceding a 4-ball break.
          In this case, black may choose not to shoot at all, and instead also
          lag to a position wide of the other two balls, meaning that red and
          yellow have successfully turned the tables of the supershot opening
          and enabled yellow to have the first attempted roquet.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to supershot opening
            


Roquet the Supershot ball

          The ultimate way to nullify the supershot ball - roquet it on the
          second turn. After roqueting blue with red, there are several options
          available. You can croquet blue towards C2 and then fire red off 6"
          north of C4. A more aggressive option would be to croquet blue
          north-west of H2 and fire red off the south boundary, south of H4 -
          this leaves black a choice of 7-8 yarders but minimal break prospects
          and difficult strokes with their third turn in order to distance the
          balls from baulk. A more novel option would be to crosswire blue and
          red at the peg, which leaves only a 17-yard shot for black with a
          baulk line in the background. An even more interesting option might be
          to roll blue close to the peg, either east or west, and then play red
          a yard or two away from it, wiring blue's backswing at red. This means
          that black probably has no lag option towards blue that doesn't leave
          a double-target for yellow.
        
Response to unusual first-turn options
Response to a first-turn C2 ball

          A first-turn C2 ball is an attempt by blue to make red conform to a
          defensive opening. Red could of course do this if it wants, by playing
          6" north of C4, or even by just having a "standard" east boundary
          ball; however a better option to negate blue's attempt at dictating
          the opening might be to set a duffer tice - this is the ultimate
          aggressive response to the C2 ball, and means that black is suddenly
          faced with having to hit a 10-13 yarder on turn 3 or risk leaving the
          same for yellow next turn, and a laid break.
        
Back to top



 Third
        Ball Options
      

        For the vast majority of players, if they manage to hit in on the third
        turn of the game, they will and should be looking to make a dream leave
        (see top of page) or similar, possibly with red near the peg and blue &
        black with a rush towards it. There are exceptions to this line of play,
        mainly with supershot openings, but unless otherwise stated, the
        standard play would be to try and set a dream leave.
      

Response to WB tice after EB opening

          Realistically, black will not be attempting to make any break on turn
          3 if it manages to hit in. The player of black has to make a judgement
          call on their likelihood of hitting the standard tice vs their
          opponent's likelihood of missing it.
        


            If the tice is long, the best response is probably to shoot black at
            blue from A baulk. Missing black at blue leaves the free shot at the
            tice for yellow of course, which does give yellow fairly good
            prospects if hit. If the tice is extremely long, say peg-high, then
            black could quite feasibly just lag at blue and attempt to leave a
            rush to red. Bear in mind that playing this lag so early in the game
            may be difficult as you may not have the pace of the court - and
            there is a risk that lagging at blue and falling short will leave
            yellow a double target on turn 4.
          

            Another option if black is uncertain, would be to shoot at blue from
            C3, and missing through to C4. This hedges black's bets somewhat, as
            it is still taking a shot at a ball and still somewhat joining with
            partner ball, but does not give good break prospects to the opponent
            if yellow hits, due to the proximity of blue and black to one
            another. Yellow is faced with a long takeoff from red towards blue
            and black and in all likelihood will not get a rush to H1 from this
            position.
          

            The third option is of course to shoot at the tice itself. Hitting
            red will give the opportunity to make a dream leave (as shown at the
            top of the page). Missing red will send black towards C2, which will
            give black a free shot back through red and yellow if yellow misses
            its fourth-turn shot at red.
          





              Some common third-ball responses to a standard tice
            


Response to C2 ball after EB opening

          There are two common options after a second-turn C2 ball - both
          consist of shooting at partner. If partner is hit, then usually the
          play will be to take off to the red in C2, roquet it and then croquet
          it either into the centre of the court, or along the west boundary,
          then lag back to partner and leave a rush in-court. However, consider
          a game where you are the stronger player playing a very capable weaker
          player, if you do hit partner third turn, you can elect to just set a
          rush to the C2 ball instead of trying to retrieve it from C2. As the
          stronger player you may prefer this line of play, instead of digging
          out the C2 ball only for your opponent to hit on turn 4 and have an
          easy break.
        

          Usually the third-turn shot at partner with black will be from A
          baulk, joining up on the east boundary if missed. This leaves a long
          double target for yellow from the end of B baulk. A more defensive
          play would be to shoot at partner from C3 into C4. Doing this leaves
          almost no break prospects fourth-turn for yellow but, depending on the
          distance between blue and black, may give them the opportunity to join
          up.
        

          Another option for black on turn 3 would be to shoot at red in C2 -
          however usually this is only a viable option if red is exactly in the
          corner, as it will mean that missing red on the right leaves no double
          target for yellow. Alternatively, another option would be for black to
          join up with red near C2, about 3-4 feet south of it. Doing so leaves
          no double target from B baulk and gives good break prospects to black
          if yellow misses the 13 yarder, although it must be remembered that
          yellow also has good prospects if it hits the 13 yarder. Black joining
          up with red also leaves a defensive shot for yellow at blue from C3 to
          C4 which, if missed, leaves black a very long and tricky takeoff from
          C2 to the east boundary.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a C2 ball
            


Response to C2 / C4 ball after Supershot opening

          The third-turn response to this option depends greatly on your ability
          and also the ability of your opponent. Before you lay the supershot,
          you need to ask yourself "am I realistically good enough to play a
          third-turn break to 4-back?". If the answer is no, then that does not
          mean that the supershot opening is a bad idea at all, but it just
          means that you may want to reassess your third-turn response.
          Additionally, if you are playing someone that you believe is much
          better than you are, then trying to give yourself a 4-ball break on
          turn 5 is exactly what you should be trying to achieve. Therefore,
          instead of trying to roquet the 13 yard shot of black at red just
          south of C2 (or just north of C4), you can instead look to join up
          with the ball 3-4 feet away, ensuring to leave no double target. This
          puts a great deal of pressure on your stronger opponent to then hit a
          13 yarder or else concede a 4-ball break to you.
        

          If you believe you are good enough to hit on turn 3 and play a break,
          then the answer is simple - hit red near C2 and go round.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / C2 ball
            


Response to EB ball after Supershot opening

          In most cases, the third-turn response to a max distance ball is to
          try and hit it from C3, missing into C4. Again, however, you should
          evaluate your own likelihood of playing a break to 4-back with only 3
          balls on the lawn if you hit, and so you may want to consider lagging
          to the ball, a couple of yards in-lawn from the east boundary.
        

          If the ball on the east boundary is south of the peg, it is tempting
          to simply shoot at it from A baulk. Missing will of course leave a
          double from B baulk, but the odds of yellow then hitting a double
          target from 20+ yards is no certainty. Alternatively, if the
          second-turn ball is around peg-high, then shooting at it from B baulk
          from a few yards west of C3 and missing often results in a fairly even
          spread of the balls, with your black ball being approximately 8 yards
          south of red and 8 yards north of C4. This again is technically a
          double target from somewhere on B Baulk, but given the distance
          between red and black, is easily missed and will leave your black ball
          a shot of only 8 yards.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / max distance
              ball
            


Response to C4 ball after EB opening

          This opening creates one of the more interesting third-turn decisions.
          A second-turn ball 6" north of C4 is a very threatening position and
          therefore the options will as follows:
        


            Shoot at partner
            
Hit - set a dream leave

                Miss - leaves yellow a 13-yard shot at red in C4 for a 4-ball
                break
              



            Shoot at opponent near C4 from A baulk
            

                Hit - set a dream leave (you may want to have a go at gaining a
                rush to H1 on partner)
              

                Miss - leave a 13-yard double for yellow (but slightly tricky
                break pick-up)
              



            Join up with opponent near C4, leaving no double
            

                If red is 3-6" north of C4 - join a yard north of it from A
                baulk
                
No short double target is left for yellow

                    Yellow still only has a 13-yard shot for the innings (but a
                    slightly tricky break pick-up)
                  



                If red is ~12" north of C4 - shoot from C3 through to C4
                

                    Enables black to have a shot (albeit very long) to attempt
                    to hit and set a dream leave
                  




Black to C2


              By burying itself in C2, this enables black to kill off the
              aggression by red and yellow. Any miss by yellow will leave a 9
              yarder (at most) for blue
            






              Some common third-ball responses to a C4 ball
            



          A personal preference of mine is to shoot third-turn at the ball near
          C4 from A baulk, because hitting gives me control of the court, and I
          miss often enough by more than several inches so as not to leave a
          double.
        

          Be on the lookout for cannons around C4 as part of this opening -
          there is often a good opportunity to bombard a live ball across to H1
          while playing a croquet stroke towards blue on the east boundary. This
          can make picking up the first break a great deal easier.
        
Response to duffer tice after EB opening

          The duffer tice is one of my favourite openings. Because of the
          placement of red near H6, a miss by black from the end of B baulk will
          be headed towards A baulk and give an easy start for yellow. That is
          why we see the ~9 yard shot at red refused so often, even by very
          strong players!
        

          If black does decide to shoot at the duffer and hits, then not a great
          deal of options are available other than to take off to partner ball
          (usually nudging red towards the peg in the process), and leave a rush
          towards red, and then hope for a fourth-turn miss by yellow.
        

          Another option for shooting at the duffer is doing so from C3,
          shooting across the court and missing to around peg-high (or just
          south of peg-high) on the west boundary. This is the most defensive
          shot available in that a miss gives no break to yellow if yellow hits
          red, but it also does not put any pressure on yellow's shot at red.
          Often times, when black misses the shot from C3 at red, it will end up
          south of peg-high on the west boundary and be a tempting free shot for
          yellow from C1.
        

          Shooting at partner ball on turn 3 is the most aggressive line of play
          - taking the shot from A baulk and hitting gives the opportunity to
          play a big croquet stroke loading partner to H2 and attempting to get
          a rush to H1 on the duffer ball - it is a big shot and the break
          chances are normally only reasonable for very strong players. Missing
          partner from A baulk on the other hand gives yellow a ~9 yard shot and
          very strong break prospects. It is therefore more usual to see black
          shoot at blue from C3 which, although longer, doesn't make all the
          balls available to yellow if black misses blue and yellow hits red. It
          also means that blue and black maintain a wide join and have realistic
          prospects of hitting back in if yellow misses red.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a duffer tice
            


Response to 2 balls on EB

          If red has shot at blue on turn 2 and missed, leaving both balls on
          the east boundary, you should carefully evaluate your response based
          on the strength of your opponent. If you and your opponent are evenly
          matched but not world class players, or especially if your opponent is
          a much stronger player than you, then the best thing to do here may be
          to simply ignore the two balls on the east boundary and lag black into
          the middle of the court and wait for yellow to miss. This potentially
          presents you with an immediate break with a ball in the middle of the
          court.
        

          In a match between two very strong players it would be unusual to see
          no shot taken on turn 3, and if hit, some attempt at digging out a
          3-ball break.
        
Response to 2 balls in-court

          In a situation where you have laid a supershot with blue, and red has
          lagged a couple of yards north east of your supershot ball, if there
          is no double target to be had from anywhere on the baulk lines, you
          must again consider your expectations after hitting third turn vs your
          opponent's likelihood of hitting fourth turn. As with previous
          options, if you are playing an opponent who on paper is a much
          stronger player, the percentage play is usually to lag the black ball
          into the middle of the court beside the other two balls (being mindful
          not to leave a double target from anywhere), which will put pressure
          on your stronger opponent to hit in or else concede the first break
          opportunity to you.
        

          If you do want to shoot with black at one of the balls in the middle,
          then consider either shooting at the easterly ball from C1 (you may
          even be able to shoot hard at this without missing to B baulk), or
          alternatively shooting at a medium pace at either blue or red from the
          closest point on A baulk. If you do shoot from the closest point, be
          sure to hit at a pace to finish slightly south of H6, both so that
          black is not a short shot from B baulk, and so that any double target
          that you leave has plenty of space between the front and back ball.
        

          If you are facing a third turn shot with black after red has
          cross-wired blue and red at the peg, check first to see if there is a
          point which you can lag to where blue won't be wired from black, and
          which won't be giving a double target from either baulk line - if
          there is such a spot, then that is the best place to lag to.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to supershot lag

 Fourth Ball Options
      

The fourth-turn response is usually actually more simple than then third-turn response - although there are more possible scenarios, they almost always result in yellow trying to roquet something.  
      

Response to ignored WB tice
When black has ignored a standard west boundary tice and insetad shot at (and missed) partner on the east boundary, the obvious response is to then try and hit red yourself from C1.  If the placement of red is good, you should have ~50% chance of hitting in.  Your break prospects after hitting red are actually quite good, as you will play a take off from red to blue & black, which will automatically be sending red towards H2 as a pioneer.  On the other hand, a miss with yellow through red into C2 only gives fairly mediocre break prospects to blue & black in the next turn.
Response to missed WB tice
If black did indeed shoot at red (and miss) from C1 in the previous turn, then the obvious response is to shoot at red yourself, but from a point east of C1 so that a miss will leave yellow joined with red.  If you hit red, your best line of play would be to roll red &  yellow towards C1 and lay a rush for your next turn.  A miss from red at yellow will of course leave black a shot through red and yellow from C2 to C1 but is likely to be a very long shot at a single ball target.  A miss from black on turn 5 here also gives you a good chance at establishing a break on turn 5.  




              If black has missed the standard tice, it leaves a good opportunity to join up with red on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C2 ball after EB opening
Having played red into C2 on turn 2, if black ignores red and simply joins with blue (which is likely), then against most players your best line of play would be to shoot at blue and black with red.  Whether you shoot from A baulk or B baulk depends on factors such as the distance between blue and black (whether it is easy to make a double target from B baulk or A baulk) and the flatness of the east boundary.  If the black ball missed blue badly on the left on turn 3, blue and black may well be 2+ yards apart on the east boundary, so there is a defensive option available to yellow as well - shoot from C3 through to C4, where a miss would not give blue & black any easy opening.
If you are the weaker player against a very strong opponent, then there is a case for shooting yellow at red - at 13 yards, it is significantly shorter than any other available shot and is therefore your best chance at winning the opening.  Red missing yellow gives blue a relatively easy start and a probable break, but against a very strong opponent it can still be worth the risk.  




              Fourth-turn responses for yellow when partner is in C2 and opponent balls are on the east boundary.  
            


Response to joined / missed C2 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, if black has for some reason shot at red in C2, then assuming a double target has been left, your best aggressive option is to shoot at this, preferably hitting the northern ball, from B baulk.  A hit or a miss here will give fairly good break prospects to whomever plays the next shot, given C2's proximity to H2 - a semi-good pioneer can usually be sent to H2 while obtaining a rush to H1.
If black has instead joined up a yard south of red on turn 2, you have no double target (except from C1, but let's not consider that).  Now you have fundamentally two options - either shoot yellow at red which will give a good break opportunity if hit (and concede a good break opportunity to black if missed), or take a more defensive line by shooting yellow at blue from C3 into C4.  If yellow misses this shot, it does give black a 1-yard roquet at red for the innings, however it not only gives no break prospects, but also requires black to play several good strokes in order to have a good leave.  Black's take off from C2 to blue on the east boundary is a difficult shot, and if black doesn't succeed in roqueting blue in its next shot (either taking off short and missing blue, or taking off too far and sending black out) then yellow will have a 9-10 yard shot at blue & black from near C4.




              If black has joined a yard south of red near C2, the yellow has aggressive and defensive options available
            


Response to missed EB ball after Supershot opening
The response here depends a lot on both the length of the supershot ball and what option black chose on turn 3.  Firstly let's assume the most common scenario, with blue halfway between H5 and peg, and 1-2 yards west of the centre line, and red approximately peg high on the EB, and black in or near C4.  In this situation the best option is normally to shoot at red from A baulk, with a miss joining up around 1 yard north of it.  This leaves blue a 15-yarder at red & yellow but difficult break prospects for both players, whomever plays the next shot. 




              The common response after a third-turn miss by black at red to C4, is for yellow to shoot at red, joining if missing.  An aggressive line is to shoot at black.  A third option is yellow at blue, which is shorter and will win you the innings, but only gives good break prospects if red and black are near to each other
            


As the weaker player against a stronger player, a very aggressive line of play would be to shoot yellow from A baulk at black in C4 - this is very black and white, as a hit will give you a good chance for a 4-ball break and a miss will give black the same chance.  As the weaker player, you can strongly consider this option.  
Consider for a moment that black's third-turn shot missed red from A baulk, or perhaps missed red from west of C3, finishing 5-10 yards south of red.  In this case, yellow for look for possible double targets available from B baulk.  Consider, too, the shortest shot available, which is yellow at blue from A baulk - this is likely a 11-13 yard shot which, if hit, gives good break prospects to yellow because red and black are close together.
Response to ignored duffer tice
The vast majority of the time the best response to black ignoring red's duffer tice, is for yellow to shoot hard at red from B baulk.  Usually a duffer tice is only 9-10 yards and so it will be, by far, the shortest shot for yellow.




              The majority of the time, the fourth turn response would be to shoot yellow at the duffer.  Against a very strong player, you might be tempted by yellow at black in C4 which, although 3 yards longer, gives an easy start to your break
            


An expection to this would be if blue & black are joined on the east boundary leaving a good double target from A baulk, and so you may want to consider shooting at that instead.  Another option to consider is if black shot and missed blue from C3 to C4.  If you are playing against a much stronger opponent you may consider shooting yellow at black from A baulk into C4.  This shot is 3 yards longer than yellow at red from B baulk, but hitting this shot gives you vastly stronger break prospects than if you hit red first.
Response to missed duffer tice
If black misses the duffer tice (red) gently, the logical response is to shoot hard at either red from B baulk or black from A baulk (whichever is closer).  If black misses the duffer tice from C3 across to the west boundary, you may consider shooting at black from C1 through to C2, particularly if black is south of peg-high.  




              If the duffer tice is still in its original position at the start of turn 4, the general response is for yellow to shoot at red given its proximity to B baulk.  If black missed red from C3 however, it can be tempting to shoot at black from C1 on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C4 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, red a few inches north of C4 and black 1 yard north of blue, yellow's default response should be to shoot at red from A baulk.  Hitting this shot gives a great break opportunity, as it is a very natural stroke to croquet red to H2 while approaching blue & black up the east boundary.  
Response to 3 balls on EB
In this instance, you simply need to hit one of the balls on the east boundary - from either A baulk or B baulk, depending on length and available targets.
Response to 3 balls in-court
A supershot opening with lags by red and black essentially forces yellow to shoot at the closest ball.  A very black and white opening, good break prospects for both players on turn 4 or 5, depending on whether yellow hits or misses.  Often times, black will have take a gentle lag while attempting a roquet at either blue or red on turn 3, so this may also give yellow some target to shoot at on turn 4.

Conclusion
If you have gotten to the bottom of this article, you have probably realised by now that the number of opening options are vast.  This article could not hope to cover every eventuality, and nor does it present any new or unseen openings; rather it serves to talk through the options and thought processes for choosing a particular option, and I hope it has been useful.

Openings

        The opening is the battle between the two sides to be the first to gain
        the upper hand. Generally when we talk about openings in croquet, we are
        referring to the first 4 turns. At the very top level it is where games
        are won and lost, but at all levels it provides a fascinating array of
        options for bluffing and double-bluffing your opponent.
      
Opening priorities
As the stronger player

        The stronger player who is playing a dangerous but less experienced /
        weaker player will generally approach the opening with the intent of not
        giving away an easy break, and hence a more defensive mindset. Openings
        where there is a lot of grey area, balls on boundaries and in corners
        are best for this. The stronger player will generally rely on their
        better all-round game in order to win, and is more comfortable with
        digging balls out slowly into a break.
      
As the weaker player

        The weaker player should approach a game against a much stronger
        opponent with an attacking mindset - they will not be afraid to take on
        relatively short shots that give laid breaks, even if it means conceding
        a laid break if they miss. The weaker player should favour openings that
        have balls in-lawn and should be looking to put pressure on the stronger
        player to have to hit in.
      
Evenly-matched players

        It is quite common to see very aggressive, black and white, openings
        when two very strong players play against each other. The same is true
        for openings between evenly-matched players at lower levels, but
        generally to a lesser extent. A lot of the opening strategy depends on
        the individual mindset of the player, with some players naturally
        playing a more attacking game than others.
      

        Below are articles on various well-known (and some not-so-well-known)
        openings, which discuss options for placement of balls, and responses to
        them. For the purposes of simplicity, in the examples below, the balls
        will always be played in the following order:
      


 Blue
        

 Red
        


          Black
        


          Yellow
        


Note: there is no ball order or sequence in which the balls need to
          be added to the game in croquet - the above order is simply to keep
          things consistent for the diagrams and explanations.


        As you can probably imagine, the options in the opening are endless.
        This article attempts to talk through some of the most common options,
        and some of the most common responses to them, with the idea of
        clarifying some of the thought processes behind them.
      

The Dream Leave

        Many of the openings below will reference something known as the Dream
        Leave - this is a scenario where the third turn ball (black) has hit and
        arranged the court as follows:
      




            Black hit on turn 3 and set a dream leave
          



        Black has retrieved red from wherever it was on the court and placed it
        slightly in-lawn from the west boundary, north of peg-high, and left
        blue a rush to it from the east boundary. This leave gives no short shot
        for yellow, and any miss by yellow will give blue a good break
        opportunity.

 First
        Ball Options
      

East Boundary

          The most common option selected by the first ball player. A ball to
          the east boundary, somewhere between level with H4 and H5, is chosen
          due to its relative distance from both baulk lines and from H1. It is
          a completely non-threatening ball and allows the second ball player to
          dictate the nature of the game, be it defensive or aggressive.
        
In-lawn East Boundary ball

          A variation on the standard east boundary ball, the in-lawn east
          boundary ball is struck out in the same area as the standard east
          boundary ball, but purposefully left about 1 yard in from the yardline
          area. The idea behind that is so that black can play its third turn
          shot out behind blue and leave itself a rush in-court. This play
          discourages responses like a west boundary tice from red.
        
Supershot

          A supershot ball is a first-turn ball placed near the middle of the
          court, normally between H5 and peg and a couple of yards west of the
          centre line. This is the most aggressive sensible option for the first
          ball, and signals your intent to your opponent that you want no grey
          area. Given its proximity to H1, a supershot ball generally gives a
          good chance for a break for either player, depending on whether the
          third-turn, fourth-turn or fifth-turn shots are hit.
        

          There are variations on the length of the supershot, with a supershot
          played to near the peg being a poorer pioneer for H1 but having the
          advantage of lengthening any fourth-turn shot by yellow at it.
        
Anti-duffer

          This opening is an attempt to try and pre-empt the second-turn
          response and discourage a "duffer tice" by red. To lay an anti-duffer,
          you hit blue to a spot somewhere between H6 and the peg, and 1-2 yards
          west of the east boundary. The idea of placing a ball here is that if
          the opponent were to lay a duffer tice with red,
          then it gives black a good chance to hit red and take off behind blue
          for a rush to H1 on turn 3. It is a leave that is generally only used
          by strong players who have a realistic chance of a third-turn break in
          the first place.
        




              Some common first-ball scenarios
            


Unusual first-turn options

          The croquet court is a big place and so there really are endless
          options for where to place balls in the opening. Often an unusual
          option first-turn will yield good results by confusing the opponent!
        
C4 first ball

          Not often seen these days due to a preference for an east boundary
          ball 10 yards further north. A weakness of this opening is that
          shooting at partner on turn 3 and missing is liable to leave a double
          target for yellow. It also generally encourages yellow to take an
          aggressive shot on turn 4; however on a difficult lawn this opening
          can have some advantages, with any hit by yellow on turn 4 at balls in
          C4 leaving little room to promote balls into the court due to the
          close proximity to the corner.
        
C2 first ball

          Playing blue into C2 first turn can often catch the opponent off
          guard. This opening attempts to flip the tables on red and yellow by
          trying to ensure a defensive opening for blue and black. This can be a
          good option where blue and black are the stronger players and want to
          prevent aggressive second-turn options by red and yellow. Of course,
          there are options available to red and yellow which negate blue and
          black's defensive preferences.
        
Micro tice

          As unusual options go, this is right up there. This option would not
          be recommended when playing a strong player, but nevertheless is very
          interesting. The micro tice is a ball played from the end of A baulk
          towards the east boundary, but only 2-3 yards towards it, leaving a
          2-3 yard roquet for the opponent on the second turn. This length of
          shot cannot really be refused, but leaving red a croquet stroke from
          south-west of hoop 4 on the second turn of the game gives no real
          break prospects. Often the second turn player will attempt an approach
          to H1 and fail it, leaving a 6-yard roquet with two balls near H1 for
          black. This opening relies more on a tactical mistake from red than
          anything else
        
C1 / C3 opening

          Occasionally seen. Not a good opening against any experienced
          opponent, but occasionally yields results. This first-turn option is
          not to be recommended. A first-turn ball in C1 followed by a
          second-turn response to C3 (or vice versa) is a killer blow to black's
          turn.
        
Back to top




 Second
        Ball Options
      


          This is where things start to get a little interesting. For the most
          part, the opening is dictated by the second ball response, and there
          are many more options available.
        
Response to East Boundary ball
Standard Tice

          The standard tice is one of the most popular responses to an east
          boundary ball at club-level croquet. Although in recent years it has
          fallen out of favour with top players (likely due to an increase in
          the standard of shooting), it is still a great opening that gives good
          chances to both sides.
        

          The standard tice is where red is played to the west boundary, and the
          distance it is placed north of C1 needs to be carefully considered by
          the striker or red. The name "tice" indicates that the distance should
          be enticing for the player of black to shoot at and so a distance of
          between about 8 and 13 yards is common. As a general rule, if possible
          the distance chosen should either be about 1 yard longer than the
          opponent's critical distance (the distance at which someone hits 50%
          of their shots) or 1 yard shorter (or equal to) your own critical
          distance. Obviously this cannot be achieved if your opponent has a
          longer critical distance than you do, so it is better to err slightly
          on the longer side.
        

          If blue is an in-lawn east boundary ball, laying a standard tice is
          risky, as black can quite easily lay a rush directly to it on the
          third turn.
        
C2 ball

          Probably the most common response to the east boundary ball today is
          the second-turn ball to 6" south of C2. The reason for playing just
          south of C2 is that if in the unlikely event of black shooting at red
          on turn 3, a miss will likely leave yellow a double target. The idea
          of red near C2 means that red is buried in a defensive position, and
          signals yellow's intent to shoot at blue and black on turn 4.
        

          If blue is slightly in-lawn, then C2 is the safest and most defensive
          response with red.
        
Duffer tice

          One of the more aggressive responses for red is the duffer tice. This
          is a ball that is placed usually about 2-feet north and a few inches
          east of penultimate. This is similarly enticing for the opponent to
          shoot (just as with a standard tice) but in this case a miss is
          usually more critical - any third turn shot at the duffer is in the
          direction of A baulk so black usually takes the shot gently - and by
          doing so is more likely to miss. Black missing leaves two balls in the
          centre of the court, giving yellow a great chance on turn 4. The
          duffer tice is a great option for weaker players playing against
          stronger players, and also for anyone confident in hitting 10 yarders.
        

          Between two very strong players a duffer tice is still a popular
          opening. There are variations on the placement of the ball near
          penult, based on the strength of the opponent. It is common to see a
          duffer tice placed level with, or south of, H6, particularly if the
          striker of red and yellow is a very good shot and is confident to hit
          an 11-yarder on turn 4. In a game between experts, the placement of
          red is sometimes moved to the west of H6 to discourage a third-turn
          break after a hit from black at blue.
        
C4 ball

          This option is very popular in New Zealand and although a mirror image
          of the C2 ball, is a lot more aggressive. Placing red 6" north of C4
          not only gives negligible break prospects to black on turn 3 but also
          signals your intent to hit fourth-turn with yellow and have a break. A
          miss at partner by black on turn 3 gives you a 13-yard shot for a
          4-ball break, and a miss by black at red on turn 3 usually gives a
          double target.
        
Shoot at first-turn ball

          A slightly counter-intuitive option but nonetheless an interesting
          one. Shooting red at blue on turn 2 and hitting gives no break
          prospects, but a miss also leaves very slim break prospects for black
          on turn 3 if it hits, unless black is a very strong player. With this
          opening it is quite common to see misses on both turns 2 and 3, and
          often a triple target for yellow at the other 3 balls on turn 4 from B
          baulk.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to east boundary opening
            


Response to Supershot ball

          The supershot ball is the most aggressive opening that the first-turn
          player can use. There are several responses to this which need to be
          considered, based on your assessment of your opponent's ability and
          whether the opponent has realistic prospects of a break to 4-back if
          they do manage to hit 3rd turn.
        
C2 response

          The C2 response is a ball played about 6" south of C2. This is a
          strong response to a supershot against almost all players. If the
          player of black wants to attempt a third-turn break, they will have to
          hit a 13-yarder and play a very difficult croquet stroke out of C2 to
          get a rush to H1, and this is by no means guaranteed. On the other
          hand, a miss by black at red on turn 3 will leave yellow a double
          target and a 4-ball break if hit.
        




              It is important to finish a few inches south of C2 with red as it
              will mean black missing on either side of it will leave a double
              target. Above is a comparison of yellow's target after a
              third-turn miss by black at red, firstly with red in C2 and
              secondly with red a few inches south of C2
            



          There are only a handful of players in the world where the C2 ball is
          not a great response - players who would expect to hit the 13 yarder
          most of the time and also be good enough at croquet strokes to expect
          to get a rush to H1 on the supershot ball. Against these players the
          strategy of lengthing the 3rd turn shot would be preferred.
        
C4 response

          Mirror image to the C2 response, this ball is played 6" north of C4.
          Consider this if blue (the supershot ball) is placed further north
          than normal (somewhere near peg-high), or is in a particular spot
          which may have H4 obscuring any croquet stroke from C4 towards it. It
          otherwise gives all the same advantages as the C2 response
        
Max Distance response

          As a counter to the very top players hitting the ball in C2 most of
          the time, the max distance response became popular - this is where red
          is played to the east boundary about level with the peg on the east
          boundary, leaving the longest shot possible for black. This response
          grants black a shot from C3 through red and into C4, reducing yellow's
          fourth-turn prospects - it relies more on black missing red than
          trying to make any break pick-up by black more difficult. Generally a
          good option against the very best players, but against most players is
          unnecessary.  
The reason why max distance on the east boundary is chosen instead of the equivalent max distance spot on the west boundary is that it is slightly further from the supershot ball (blue), which is slightly south-west of the peg.  Assuming that the shots on turns 3 and 4 are missed, blue's shot at red & yellow on the east boundary will be a couple of yards longer than the equivalent shot to the west boundary.  
Supershot lag

          The response for red to lag to a spot 3-4 yards east and 1-2 yards
          north of the supershot ball is a very strong and very under-used
          response to the supershot. This is a good tactic when playing someone
          who is a very good shot, and in particular if the supershot ball
          itself is quite deep (nearer the peg than H5). Placing red beside blue
          nullifies the strength of black's shooting by encouraging black to
          take its third turn shot gently (which is generally less accurate), or
          risk shooting hard and missing into B baulk, conceding a 4-ball break.
          In this case, black may choose not to shoot at all, and instead also
          lag to a position wide of the other two balls, meaning that red and
          yellow have successfully turned the tables of the supershot opening
          and enabled yellow to have the first attempted roquet.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to supershot opening
            


Roquet the Supershot ball

          The ultimate way to nullify the supershot ball - roquet it on the
          second turn. After roqueting blue with red, there are several options
          available. You can croquet blue towards C2 and then fire red off 6"
          north of C4. A more aggressive option would be to croquet blue
          north-west of H2 and fire red off the south boundary, south of H4 -
          this leaves black a choice of 7-8 yarders but minimal break prospects
          and difficult strokes with their third turn in order to distance the
          balls from baulk. A more novel option would be to crosswire blue and
          red at the peg, which leaves only a 17-yard shot for black with a
          baulk line in the background. An even more interesting option might be
          to roll blue close to the peg, either east or west, and then play red
          a yard or two away from it, wiring blue's backswing at red. This means
          that black probably has no lag option towards blue that doesn't leave
          a double-target for yellow.
        
Response to unusual first-turn options
Response to a first-turn C2 ball

          A first-turn C2 ball is an attempt by blue to make red conform to a
          defensive opening. Red could of course do this if it wants, by playing
          6" north of C4, or even by just having a "standard" east boundary
          ball; however a better option to negate blue's attempt at dictating
          the opening might be to set a duffer tice - this is the ultimate
          aggressive response to the C2 ball, and means that black is suddenly
          faced with having to hit a 10-13 yarder on turn 3 or risk leaving the
          same for yellow next turn, and a laid break.

 Third
        Ball Options
      

        For the vast majority of players, if they manage to hit in on the third
        turn of the game, they will and should be looking to make a dream leave
        (see top of page) or similar, possibly with red near the peg and blue &
        black with a rush towards it. There are exceptions to this line of play,
        mainly with supershot openings, but unless otherwise stated, the
        standard play would be to try and set a dream leave.
      

Response to WB tice after EB opening

          Realistically, black will not be attempting to make any break on turn
          3 if it manages to hit in. The player of black has to make a judgement
          call on their likelihood of hitting the standard tice vs their
          opponent's likelihood of missing it.
        


            If the tice is long, the best response is probably to shoot black at
            blue from A baulk. Missing black at blue leaves the free shot at the
            tice for yellow of course, which does give yellow fairly good
            prospects if hit. If the tice is extremely long, say peg-high, then
            black could quite feasibly just lag at blue and attempt to leave a
            rush to red. Bear in mind that playing this lag so early in the game
            may be difficult as you may not have the pace of the court - and
            there is a risk that lagging at blue and falling short will leave
            yellow a double target on turn 4.
          

            Another option if black is uncertain, would be to shoot at blue from
            C3, and missing through to C4. This hedges black's bets somewhat, as
            it is still taking a shot at a ball and still somewhat joining with
            partner ball, but does not give good break prospects to the opponent
            if yellow hits, due to the proximity of blue and black to one
            another. Yellow is faced with a long takeoff from red towards blue
            and black and in all likelihood will not get a rush to H1 from this
            position.
          

            The third option is of course to shoot at the tice itself. Hitting
            red will give the opportunity to make a dream leave (as shown at the
            top of the page). Missing red will send black towards C2, which will
            give black a free shot back through red and yellow if yellow misses
            its fourth-turn shot at red.
          





              Some common third-ball responses to a standard tice
            


Response to C2 ball after EB opening

          There are two common options after a second-turn C2 ball - both
          consist of shooting at partner. If partner is hit, then usually the
          play will be to take off to the red in C2, roquet it and then croquet
          it either into the centre of the court, or along the west boundary,
          then lag back to partner and leave a rush in-court. However, consider
          a game where you are the stronger player playing a very capable weaker
          player, if you do hit partner third turn, you can elect to just set a
          rush to the C2 ball instead of trying to retrieve it from C2. As the
          stronger player you may prefer this line of play, instead of digging
          out the C2 ball only for your opponent to hit on turn 4 and have an
          easy break.
        

          Usually the third-turn shot at partner with black will be from A
          baulk, joining up on the east boundary if missed. This leaves a long
          double target for yellow from the end of B baulk. A more defensive
          play would be to shoot at partner from C3 into C4. Doing this leaves
          almost no break prospects fourth-turn for yellow but, depending on the
          distance between blue and black, may give them the opportunity to join
          up.
        

          Another option for black on turn 3 would be to shoot at red in C2 -
          however usually this is only a viable option if red is exactly in the
          corner, as it will mean that missing red on the right leaves no double
          target for yellow. Alternatively, another option would be for black to
          join up with red near C2, about 3-4 feet south of it. Doing so leaves
          no double target from B baulk and gives good break prospects to black
          if yellow misses the 13 yarder, although it must be remembered that
          yellow also has good prospects if it hits the 13 yarder. Black joining
          up with red also leaves a defensive shot for yellow at blue from C3 to
          C4 which, if missed, leaves black a very long and tricky takeoff from
          C2 to the east boundary.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a C2 ball
            


Response to C2 / C4 ball after Supershot opening

          The third-turn response to this option depends greatly on your ability
          and also the ability of your opponent. Before you lay the supershot,
          you need to ask yourself "am I realistically good enough to play a
          third-turn break to 4-back?". If the answer is no, then that does not
          mean that the supershot opening is a bad idea at all, but it just
          means that you may want to reassess your third-turn response.
          Additionally, if you are playing someone that you believe is much
          better than you are, then trying to give yourself a 4-ball break on
          turn 5 is exactly what you should be trying to achieve. Therefore,
          instead of trying to roquet the 13 yard shot of black at red just
          south of C2 (or just north of C4), you can instead look to join up
          with the ball 3-4 feet away, ensuring to leave no double target. This
          puts a great deal of pressure on your stronger opponent to then hit a
          13 yarder or else concede a 4-ball break to you.
        

          If you believe you are good enough to hit on turn 3 and play a break,
          then the answer is simple - hit red near C2 and go round.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / C2 ball
            


Response to EB ball after Supershot opening

          In most cases, the third-turn response to a max distance ball is to
          try and hit it from C3, missing into C4. Again, however, you should
          evaluate your own likelihood of playing a break to 4-back with only 3
          balls on the lawn if you hit, and so you may want to consider lagging
          to the ball, a couple of yards in-lawn from the east boundary.
        

          If the ball on the east boundary is south of the peg, it is tempting
          to simply shoot at it from A baulk. Missing will of course leave a
          double from B baulk, but the odds of yellow then hitting a double
          target from 20+ yards is no certainty. Alternatively, if the
          second-turn ball is around peg-high, then shooting at it from B baulk
          from a few yards west of C3 and missing often results in a fairly even
          spread of the balls, with your black ball being approximately 8 yards
          south of red and 8 yards north of C4. This again is technically a
          double target from somewhere on B Baulk, but given the distance
          between red and black, is easily missed and will leave your black ball
          a shot of only 8 yards.

              ball
            


Response to C4 ball after EB opening

          This opening creates one of the more interesting third-turn decisions.
          A second-turn ball 6" north of C4 is a very threatening position and
          therefore the options will as follows:
        


            Shoot at partner
            
Hit - set a dream leave

                Miss - leaves yellow a 13-yard shot at red in C4 for a 4-ball
                break
              



            Shoot at opponent near C4 from A baulk
            

                Hit - set a dream leave (you may want to have a go at gaining a
                rush to H1 on partner)
              

                Miss - leave a 13-yard double for yellow (but slightly tricky
                break pick-up)
              



            Join up with opponent near C4, leaving no double
            

                If red is 3-6" north of C4 - join a yard north of it from A
                baulk
                
No short double target is left for yellow

                    Yellow still only has a 13-yard shot for the innings (but a
                    slightly tricky break pick-up)
                  



                If red is ~12" north of C4 - shoot from C3 through to C4
                

                    Enables black to have a shot (albeit very long) to attempt
                    to hit and set a dream leave
                  




Black to C2


              By burying itself in C2, this enables black to kill off the
              aggression by red and yellow. Any miss by yellow will leave a 9
              yarder (at most) for blue
            






              Some common third-ball responses to a C4 ball
            



          A personal preference of mine is to shoot third-turn at the ball near
          C4 from A baulk, because hitting gives me control of the court, and I
          miss often enough by more than several inches so as not to leave a
          double.
        

          Be on the lookout for cannons around C4 as part of this opening -
          there is often a good opportunity to bombard a live ball across to H1
          while playing a croquet stroke towards blue on the east boundary. This
          can make picking up the first break a great deal easier.
        
Response to duffer tice after EB opening

          The duffer tice is one of my favourite openings. Because of the
          placement of red near H6, a miss by black from the end of B baulk will
          be headed towards A baulk and give an easy start for yellow. That is
          why we see the ~9 yard shot at red refused so often, even by very
          strong players!
        

          If black does decide to shoot at the duffer and hits, then not a great
          deal of options are available other than to take off to partner ball
          (usually nudging red towards the peg in the process), and leave a rush
          towards red, and then hope for a fourth-turn miss by yellow.
        

          Another option for shooting at the duffer is doing so from C3,
          shooting across the court and missing to around peg-high (or just
          south of peg-high) on the west boundary. This is the most defensive
          shot available in that a miss gives no break to yellow if yellow hits
          red, but it also does not put any pressure on yellow's shot at red.
          Often times, when black misses the shot from C3 at red, it will end up
          south of peg-high on the west boundary and be a tempting free shot for
          yellow from C1.
        

          Shooting at partner ball on turn 3 is the most aggressive line of play
          - taking the shot from A baulk and hitting gives the opportunity to
          play a big croquet stroke loading partner to H2 and attempting to get
          a rush to H1 on the duffer ball - it is a big shot and the break
          chances are normally only reasonable for very strong players. Missing
          partner from A baulk on the other hand gives yellow a ~9 yard shot and
          very strong break prospects. It is therefore more usual to see black
          shoot at blue from C3 which, although longer, doesn't make all the
          balls available to yellow if black misses blue and yellow hits red. It
          also means that blue and black maintain a wide join and have realistic
          prospects of hitting back in if yellow misses red.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a duffer tice
            


Response to 2 balls on EB

          If red has shot at blue on turn 2 and missed, leaving both balls on
          the east boundary, you should carefully evaluate your response based
          on the strength of your opponent. If you and your opponent are evenly
          matched but not world class players, or especially if your opponent is
          a much stronger player than you, then the best thing to do here may be
          to simply ignore the two balls on the east boundary and lag black into
          the middle of the court and wait for yellow to miss. This potentially
          presents you with an immediate break with a ball in the middle of the
          court.
        

          In a match between two very strong players it would be unusual to see
          no shot taken on turn 3, and if hit, some attempt at digging out a
          3-ball break.
        
Response to 2 balls in-court

          In a situation where you have laid a supershot with blue, and red has
          lagged a couple of yards north east of your supershot ball, if there
          is no double target to be had from anywhere on the baulk lines, you
          must again consider your expectations after hitting third turn vs your
          opponent's likelihood of hitting fourth turn. As with previous
          options, if you are playing an opponent who on paper is a much
          stronger player, the percentage play is usually to lag the black ball
          into the middle of the court beside the other two balls (being mindful
          not to leave a double target from anywhere), which will put pressure
          on your stronger opponent to hit in or else concede the first break
          opportunity to you.
        

          If you do want to shoot with black at one of the balls in the middle,
          then consider either shooting at the easterly ball from C1 (you may
          even be able to shoot hard at this without missing to B baulk), or
          alternatively shooting at a medium pace at either blue or red from the
          closest point on A baulk. If you do shoot from the closest point, be
          sure to hit at a pace to finish slightly south of H6, both so that
          black is not a short shot from B baulk, and so that any double target
          that you leave has plenty of space between the front and back ball.
        

          If you are facing a third turn shot with black after red has
          cross-wired blue and red at the peg, check first to see if there is a
          point which you can lag to where blue won't be wired from black, and
          which won't be giving a double target from either baulk line - if
          there is such a spot, then that is the best place to lag to.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to supershot lag
            


Back to top



 Fourth Ball Options
      

The fourth-turn response is usually actually more simple than then third-turn response - although there are more possible scenarios, they almost always result in yellow trying to roquet something.  
      

Response to ignored WB tice
When black has ignored a standard west boundary tice and insetad shot at (and missed) partner on the east boundary, the obvious response is to then try and hit red yourself from C1.  If the placement of red is good, you should have ~50% chance of hitting in.  Your break prospects after hitting red are actually quite good, as you will play a take off from red to blue & black, which will automatically be sending red towards H2 as a pioneer.  On the other hand, a miss with yellow through red into C2 only gives fairly mediocre break prospects to blue & black in the next turn.
Response to missed WB tice
If black did indeed shoot at red (and miss) from C1 in the previous turn, then the obvious response is to shoot at red yourself, but from a point east of C1 so that a miss will leave yellow joined with red.  If you hit red, your best line of play would be to roll red &  yellow towards C1 and lay a rush for your next turn.  A miss from red at yellow will of course leave black a shot through red and yellow from C2 to C1 but is likely to be a very long shot at a single ball target.  A miss from black on turn 5 here also gives you a good chance at establishing a break on turn 5.  




              If black has missed the standard tice, it leaves a good opportunity to join up with red on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C2 ball after EB opening
Having played red into C2 on turn 2, if black ignores red and simply joins with blue (which is likely), then against most players your best line of play would be to shoot at blue and black with red.  Whether you shoot from A baulk or B baulk depends on factors such as the distance between blue and black (whether it is easy to make a double target from B baulk or A baulk) and the flatness of the east boundary.  If the black ball missed blue badly on the left on turn 3, blue and black may well be 2+ yards apart on the east boundary, so there is a defensive option available to yellow as well - shoot from C3 through to C4, where a miss would not give blue & black any easy opening.
If you are the weaker player against a very strong opponent, then there is a case for shooting yellow at red - at 13 yards, it is significantly shorter than any other available shot and is therefore your best chance at winning the opening.  Red missing yellow gives blue a relatively easy start and a probable break, but against a very strong opponent it can still be worth the risk.  




              Fourth-turn responses for yellow when partner is in C2 and opponent balls are on the east boundary.  
            


Response to joined / missed C2 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, if black has for some reason shot at red in C2, then assuming a double target has been left, your best aggressive option is to shoot at this, preferably hitting the northern ball, from B baulk.  A hit or a miss here will give fairly good break prospects to whomever plays the next shot, given C2's proximity to H2 - a semi-good pioneer can usually be sent to H2 while obtaining a rush to H1.
If black has instead joined up a yard south of red on turn 2, you have no double target (except from C1, but let's not consider that).  Now you have fundamentally two options - either shoot yellow at red which will give a good break opportunity if hit (and concede a good break opportunity to black if missed), or take a more defensive line by shooting yellow at blue from C3 into C4.  If yellow misses this shot, it does give black a 1-yard roquet at red for the innings, however it not only gives no break prospects, but also requires black to play several good strokes in order to have a good leave.  Black's take off from C2 to blue on the east boundary is a difficult shot, and if black doesn't succeed in roqueting blue in its next shot (either taking off short and missing blue, or taking off too far and sending black out) then yellow will have a 9-10 yard shot at blue & black from near C4.




              If black has joined a yard south of red near C2, the yellow has aggressive and defensive options available
            


Response to missed EB ball after Supershot opening
The response here depends a lot on both the length of the supershot ball and what option black chose on turn 3.  Firstly let's assume the most common scenario, with blue halfway between H5 and peg, and 1-2 yards west of the centre line, and red approximately peg high on the EB, and black in or near C4.  In this situation the best option is normally to shoot at red from A baulk, with a miss joining up around 1 yard north of it.  This leaves blue a 15-yarder at red & yellow but difficult break prospects for both players, whomever plays the next shot. 




              The common response after a third-turn miss by black at red to C4, is for yellow to shoot at red, joining if missing.  An aggressive line is to shoot at black.  A third option is yellow at blue, which is shorter and will win you the innings, but only gives good break prospects if red and black are near to each other
            


As the weaker player against a stronger player, a very aggressive line of play would be to shoot yellow from A baulk at black in C4 - this is very black and white, as a hit will give you a good chance for a 4-ball break and a miss will give black the same chance.  As the weaker player, you can strongly consider this option.  
Consider for a moment that black's third-turn shot missed red from A baulk, or perhaps missed red from west of C3, finishing 5-10 yards south of red.  In this case, yellow for look for possible double targets available from B baulk.  Consider, too, the shortest shot available, which is yellow at blue from A baulk - this is likely a 11-13 yard shot which, if hit, gives good break prospects to yellow because red and black are close together.
Response to ignored duffer tice
The vast majority of the time the best response to black ignoring red's duffer tice, is for yellow to shoot hard at red from B baulk.  Usually a duffer tice is only 9-10 yards and so it will be, by far, the shortest shot for yellow.




              The majority of the time, the fourth turn response would be to shoot yellow at the duffer.  Against a very strong player, you might be tempted by yellow at black in C4 which, although 3 yards longer, gives an easy start to your break
            


An expection to this would be if blue & black are joined on the east boundary leaving a good double target from A baulk, and so you may want to consider shooting at that instead.  Another option to consider is if black shot and missed blue from C3 to C4.  If you are playing against a much stronger opponent you may consider shooting yellow at black from A baulk into C4.  This shot is 3 yards longer than yellow at red from B baulk, but hitting this shot gives you vastly stronger break prospects than if you hit red first.
Response to missed duffer tice
If black misses the duffer tice (red) gently, the logical response is to shoot hard at either red from B baulk or black from A baulk (whichever is closer).  If black misses the duffer tice from C3 across to the west boundary, you may consider shooting at black from C1 through to C2, particularly if black is south of peg-high.  




              If the duffer tice is still in its original position at the start of turn 4, the general response is for yellow to shoot at red given its proximity to B baulk.  If black missed red from C3 however, it can be tempting to shoot at black from C1 on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C4 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, red a few inches north of C4 and black 1 yard north of blue, yellow's default response should be to shoot at red from A baulk.  Hitting this shot gives a great break opportunity, as it is a very natural stroke to croquet red to H2 while approaching blue & black up the east boundary.  
Response to 3 balls on EB
In this instance, you simply need to hit one of the balls on the east boundary - from either A baulk or B baulk, depending on length and available targets.
Response to 3 balls in-court
A supershot opening with lags by red and black essentially forces yellow to shoot at the closest ball.  A very black and white opening, good break prospects for both players on turn 4 or 5, depending on whether yellow hits or misses.  Often times, black will have take a gentle lag while attempting a roquet at either blue or red on turn 3, so this may also give yellow some target to shoot at on turn 4.

Conclusion
If you have gotten to the bottom of this article, you have probably realised by now that the number of opening options are vast.  This article could not hope to cover every eventuality, and nor does it present any new or unseen openings; rather it serves to talk through the options and thought processes for choosing a particular option, and I hope it has been useful.

Openings

        The opening is the battle between the two sides to be the first to gain
        the upper hand. Generally when we talk about openings in croquet, we are
        referring to the first 4 turns. At the very top level it is where games
        are won and lost, but at all levels it provides a fascinating array of
        options for bluffing and double-bluffing your opponent.
      
Opening priorities
As the stronger player

        The stronger player who is playing a dangerous but less experienced /
        weaker player will generally approach the opening with the intent of not
        giving away an easy break, and hence a more defensive mindset. Openings
        where there is a lot of grey area, balls on boundaries and in corners
        are best for this. The stronger player will generally rely on their
        better all-round game in order to win, and is more comfortable with
        digging balls out slowly into a break.
      
As the weaker player

        The weaker player should approach a game against a much stronger
        opponent with an attacking mindset - they will not be afraid to take on
        relatively short shots that give laid breaks, even if it means conceding
        a laid break if they miss. The weaker player should favour openings that
        have balls in-lawn and should be looking to put pressure on the stronger
        player to have to hit in.
      
Evenly-matched players

        It is quite common to see very aggressive, black and white, openings
        when two very strong players play against each other. The same is true
        for openings between evenly-matched players at lower levels, but
        generally to a lesser extent. A lot of the opening strategy depends on
        the individual mindset of the player, with some players naturally
        playing a more attacking game than others.
      

        Below are articles on various well-known (and some not-so-well-known)
        openings, which discuss options for placement of balls, and responses to
        them. For the purposes of simplicity, in the examples below, the balls
        will always be played in the following order:
      


 Blue
        

 Red
        


          Black
        


          Yellow
        


Note: there is no ball order or sequence in which the balls need to
          be added to the game in croquet - the above order is simply to keep
          things consistent for the diagrams and explanations.


        As you can probably imagine, the options in the opening are endless.
        This article attempts to talk through some of the most common options,
        and some of the most common responses to them, with the idea of
        clarifying some of the thought processes behind them.
      

The Dream Leave

        Many of the openings below will reference something known as the Dream
        Leave - this is a scenario where the third turn ball (black) has hit and
        arranged the court as follows:
      




            Black hit on turn 3 and set a dream leave
          



        Black has retrieved red from wherever it was on the court and placed it
        slightly in-lawn from the west boundary, north of peg-high, and left
        blue a rush to it from the east boundary. This leave gives no short shot
        for yellow, and any miss by yellow will give blue a good break
        opportunity.

 First
        Ball Options
      

East Boundary

          The most common option selected by the first ball player. A ball to
          the east boundary, somewhere between level with H4 and H5, is chosen
          due to its relative distance from both baulk lines and from H1. It is
          a completely non-threatening ball and allows the second ball player to
          dictate the nature of the game, be it defensive or aggressive.
        
In-lawn East Boundary ball

          A variation on the standard east boundary ball, the in-lawn east
          boundary ball is struck out in the same area as the standard east
          boundary ball, but purposefully left about 1 yard in from the yardline
          area. The idea behind that is so that black can play its third turn
          shot out behind blue and leave itself a rush in-court. This play
          discourages responses like a west boundary tice from red.
        
Supershot

          A supershot ball is a first-turn ball placed near the middle of the
          court, normally between H5 and peg and a couple of yards west of the
          centre line. This is the most aggressive sensible option for the first
          ball, and signals your intent to your opponent that you want no grey
          area. Given its proximity to H1, a supershot ball generally gives a
          good chance for a break for either player, depending on whether the
          third-turn, fourth-turn or fifth-turn shots are hit.
        

          There are variations on the length of the supershot, with a supershot
          played to near the peg being a poorer pioneer for H1 but having the
          advantage of lengthening any fourth-turn shot by yellow at it.
        
Anti-duffer

          This opening is an attempt to try and pre-empt the second-turn
          response and discourage a "duffer tice" by red. To lay an anti-duffer,
          you hit blue to a spot somewhere between H6 and the peg, and 1-2 yards
          west of the east boundary. The idea of placing a ball here is that if
          the opponent were to lay a duffer tice with red,
          then it gives black a good chance to hit red and take off behind blue
          for a rush to H1 on turn 3. It is a leave that is generally only used
          by strong players who have a realistic chance of a third-turn break in
          the first place.
        




              Some common first-ball scenarios
            


Unusual first-turn options

          The croquet court is a big place and so there really are endless
          options for where to place balls in the opening. Often an unusual
          option first-turn will yield good results by confusing the opponent!
        
C4 first ball

          Not often seen these days due to a preference for an east boundary
          ball 10 yards further north. A weakness of this opening is that
          shooting at partner on turn 3 and missing is liable to leave a double
          target for yellow. It also generally encourages yellow to take an
          aggressive shot on turn 4; however on a difficult lawn this opening
          can have some advantages, with any hit by yellow on turn 4 at balls in
          C4 leaving little room to promote balls into the court due to the
          close proximity to the corner.
        
C2 first ball

          Playing blue into C2 first turn can often catch the opponent off
          guard. This opening attempts to flip the tables on red and yellow by
          trying to ensure a defensive opening for blue and black. This can be a
          good option where blue and black are the stronger players and want to
          prevent aggressive second-turn options by red and yellow. Of course,
          there are options available to red and yellow which negate blue and
          black's defensive preferences.
        
Micro tice

          As unusual options go, this is right up there. This option would not
          be recommended when playing a strong player, but nevertheless is very
          interesting. The micro tice is a ball played from the end of A baulk
          towards the east boundary, but only 2-3 yards towards it, leaving a
          2-3 yard roquet for the opponent on the second turn. This length of
          shot cannot really be refused, but leaving red a croquet stroke from
          south-west of hoop 4 on the second turn of the game gives no real
          break prospects. Often the second turn player will attempt an approach
          to H1 and fail it, leaving a 6-yard roquet with two balls near H1 for
          black. This opening relies more on a tactical mistake from red than
          anything else
        
C1 / C3 opening

          Occasionally seen. Not a good opening against any experienced
          opponent, but occasionally yields results. This first-turn option is
          not to be recommended. A first-turn ball in C1 followed by a
          second-turn response to C3 (or vice versa) is a killer blow to black's
          turn.

 Second
        Ball Options
      


          This is where things start to get a little interesting. For the most
          part, the opening is dictated by the second ball response, and there
          are many more options available.
        
Response to East Boundary ball
Standard Tice

          The standard tice is one of the most popular responses to an east
          boundary ball at club-level croquet. Although in recent years it has
          fallen out of favour with top players (likely due to an increase in
          the standard of shooting), it is still a great opening that gives good
          chances to both sides.
        

          The standard tice is where red is played to the west boundary, and the
          distance it is placed north of C1 needs to be carefully considered by
          the striker or red. The name "tice" indicates that the distance should
          be enticing for the player of black to shoot at and so a distance of
          between about 8 and 13 yards is common. As a general rule, if possible
          the distance chosen should either be about 1 yard longer than the
          opponent's critical distance (the distance at which someone hits 50%
          of their shots) or 1 yard shorter (or equal to) your own critical
          distance. Obviously this cannot be achieved if your opponent has a
          longer critical distance than you do, so it is better to err slightly
          on the longer side.
        

          If blue is an in-lawn east boundary ball, laying a standard tice is
          risky, as black can quite easily lay a rush directly to it on the
          third turn.
        
C2 ball

          Probably the most common response to the east boundary ball today is
          the second-turn ball to 6" south of C2. The reason for playing just
          south of C2 is that if in the unlikely event of black shooting at red
          on turn 3, a miss will likely leave yellow a double target. The idea
          of red near C2 means that red is buried in a defensive position, and
          signals yellow's intent to shoot at blue and black on turn 4.
        

          If blue is slightly in-lawn, then C2 is the safest and most defensive
          response with red.
        
Duffer tice

          One of the more aggressive responses for red is the duffer tice. This
          is a ball that is placed usually about 2-feet north and a few inches
          east of penultimate. This is similarly enticing for the opponent to
          shoot (just as with a standard tice) but in this case a miss is
          usually more critical - any third turn shot at the duffer is in the
          direction of A baulk so black usually takes the shot gently - and by
          doing so is more likely to miss. Black missing leaves two balls in the
          centre of the court, giving yellow a great chance on turn 4. The
          duffer tice is a great option for weaker players playing against
          stronger players, and also for anyone confident in hitting 10 yarders.
        

          Between two very strong players a duffer tice is still a popular
          opening. There are variations on the placement of the ball near
          penult, based on the strength of the opponent. It is common to see a
          duffer tice placed level with, or south of, H6, particularly if the
          striker of red and yellow is a very good shot and is confident to hit
          an 11-yarder on turn 4. In a game between experts, the placement of
          red is sometimes moved to the west of H6 to discourage a third-turn
          break after a hit from black at blue.
        
C4 ball

          This option is very popular in New Zealand and although a mirror image
          of the C2 ball, is a lot more aggressive. Placing red 6" north of C4
          not only gives negligible break prospects to black on turn 3 but also
          signals your intent to hit fourth-turn with yellow and have a break. A
          miss at partner by black on turn 3 gives you a 13-yard shot for a
          4-ball break, and a miss by black at red on turn 3 usually gives a
          double target.
        
Shoot at first-turn ball

          A slightly counter-intuitive option but nonetheless an interesting
          one. Shooting red at blue on turn 2 and hitting gives no break
          prospects, but a miss also leaves very slim break prospects for black
          on turn 3 if it hits, unless black is a very strong player. With this
          opening it is quite common to see misses on both turns 2 and 3, and
          often a triple target for yellow at the other 3 balls on turn 4 from B
          baulk.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to east boundary opening
            


Response to Supershot ball

          The supershot ball is the most aggressive opening that the first-turn
          player can use. There are several responses to this which need to be
          considered, based on your assessment of your opponent's ability and
          whether the opponent has realistic prospects of a break to 4-back if
          they do manage to hit 3rd turn.
        
C2 response

          The C2 response is a ball played about 6" south of C2. This is a
          strong response to a supershot against almost all players. If the
          player of black wants to attempt a third-turn break, they will have to
          hit a 13-yarder and play a very difficult croquet stroke out of C2 to
          get a rush to H1, and this is by no means guaranteed. On the other
          hand, a miss by black at red on turn 3 will leave yellow a double
          target and a 4-ball break if hit.
        




              It is important to finish a few inches south of C2 with red as it
              will mean black missing on either side of it will leave a double
              target. Above is a comparison of yellow's target after a
              third-turn miss by black at red, firstly with red in C2 and
              secondly with red a few inches south of C2
            



          There are only a handful of players in the world where the C2 ball is
          not a great response - players who would expect to hit the 13 yarder
          most of the time and also be good enough at croquet strokes to expect
          to get a rush to H1 on the supershot ball. Against these players the
          strategy of lengthing the 3rd turn shot would be preferred.
        
C4 response

          Mirror image to the C2 response, this ball is played 6" north of C4.
          Consider this if blue (the supershot ball) is placed further north
          than normal (somewhere near peg-high), or is in a particular spot
          which may have H4 obscuring any croquet stroke from C4 towards it. It
          otherwise gives all the same advantages as the C2 response
        
Max Distance response

          As a counter to the very top players hitting the ball in C2 most of
          the time, the max distance response became popular - this is where red
          is played to the east boundary about level with the peg on the east
          boundary, leaving the longest shot possible for black. This response
          grants black a shot from C3 through red and into C4, reducing yellow's
          fourth-turn prospects - it relies more on black missing red than
          trying to make any break pick-up by black more difficult. Generally a
          good option against the very best players, but against most players is
          unnecessary.  
The reason why max distance on the east boundary is chosen instead of the equivalent max distance spot on the west boundary is that it is slightly further from the supershot ball (blue), which is slightly south-west of the peg.  Assuming that the shots on turns 3 and 4 are missed, blue's shot at red & yellow on the east boundary will be a couple of yards longer than the equivalent shot to the west boundary.  
Supershot lag

          The response for red to lag to a spot 3-4 yards east and 1-2 yards
          north of the supershot ball is a very strong and very under-used
          response to the supershot. This is a good tactic when playing someone
          who is a very good shot, and in particular if the supershot ball
          itself is quite deep (nearer the peg than H5). Placing red beside blue
          nullifies the strength of black's shooting by encouraging black to
          take its third turn shot gently (which is generally less accurate), or
          risk shooting hard and missing into B baulk, conceding a 4-ball break.
          In this case, black may choose not to shoot at all, and instead also
          lag to a position wide of the other two balls, meaning that red and
          yellow have successfully turned the tables of the supershot opening
          and enabled yellow to have the first attempted roquet.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to supershot opening
            


Roquet the Supershot ball

          The ultimate way to nullify the supershot ball - roquet it on the
          second turn. After roqueting blue with red, there are several options
          available. You can croquet blue towards C2 and then fire red off 6"
          north of C4. A more aggressive option would be to croquet blue
          north-west of H2 and fire red off the south boundary, south of H4 -
          this leaves black a choice of 7-8 yarders but minimal break prospects
          and difficult strokes with their third turn in order to distance the
          balls from baulk. A more novel option would be to crosswire blue and
          red at the peg, which leaves only a 17-yard shot for black with a
          baulk line in the background. An even more interesting option might be
          to roll blue close to the peg, either east or west, and then play red
          a yard or two away from it, wiring blue's backswing at red. This means
          that black probably has no lag option towards blue that doesn't leave
          a double-target for yellow.
        
Response to unusual first-turn options
Response to a first-turn C2 ball

          A first-turn C2 ball is an attempt by blue to make red conform to a
          defensive opening. Red could of course do this if it wants, by playing
          6" north of C4, or even by just having a "standard" east boundary
          ball; however a better option to negate blue's attempt at dictating
          the opening might be to set a duffer tice - this is the ultimate
          aggressive response to the C2 ball, and means that black is suddenly
          faced with having to hit a 10-13 yarder on turn 3 or risk leaving the
          same for yellow next turn, and a laid break.

 Third
        Ball Options
      

        For the vast majority of players, if they manage to hit in on the third
        turn of the game, they will and should be looking to make a dream leave
        (see top of page) or similar, possibly with red near the peg and blue &
        black with a rush towards it. There are exceptions to this line of play,
        mainly with supershot openings, but unless otherwise stated, the
        standard play would be to try and set a dream leave.
      

Response to WB tice after EB opening

          Realistically, black will not be attempting to make any break on turn
          3 if it manages to hit in. The player of black has to make a judgement
          call on their likelihood of hitting the standard tice vs their
          opponent's likelihood of missing it.
        


            If the tice is long, the best response is probably to shoot black at
            blue from A baulk. Missing black at blue leaves the free shot at the
            tice for yellow of course, which does give yellow fairly good
            prospects if hit. If the tice is extremely long, say peg-high, then
            black could quite feasibly just lag at blue and attempt to leave a
            rush to red. Bear in mind that playing this lag so early in the game
            may be difficult as you may not have the pace of the court - and
            there is a risk that lagging at blue and falling short will leave
            yellow a double target on turn 4.
          

            Another option if black is uncertain, would be to shoot at blue from
            C3, and missing through to C4. This hedges black's bets somewhat, as
            it is still taking a shot at a ball and still somewhat joining with
            partner ball, but does not give good break prospects to the opponent
            if yellow hits, due to the proximity of blue and black to one
            another. Yellow is faced with a long takeoff from red towards blue
            and black and in all likelihood will not get a rush to H1 from this
            position.
          

            The third option is of course to shoot at the tice itself. Hitting
            red will give the opportunity to make a dream leave (as shown at the
            top of the page). Missing red will send black towards C2, which will
            give black a free shot back through red and yellow if yellow misses
            its fourth-turn shot at red.
          





              Some common third-ball responses to a standard tice
            


Response to C2 ball after EB opening

          There are two common options after a second-turn C2 ball - both
          consist of shooting at partner. If partner is hit, then usually the
          play will be to take off to the red in C2, roquet it and then croquet
          it either into the centre of the court, or along the west boundary,
          then lag back to partner and leave a rush in-court. However, consider
          a game where you are the stronger player playing a very capable weaker
          player, if you do hit partner third turn, you can elect to just set a
          rush to the C2 ball instead of trying to retrieve it from C2. As the
          stronger player you may prefer this line of play, instead of digging
          out the C2 ball only for your opponent to hit on turn 4 and have an
          easy break.
        

          Usually the third-turn shot at partner with black will be from A
          baulk, joining up on the east boundary if missed. This leaves a long
          double target for yellow from the end of B baulk. A more defensive
          play would be to shoot at partner from C3 into C4. Doing this leaves
          almost no break prospects fourth-turn for yellow but, depending on the
          distance between blue and black, may give them the opportunity to join
          up.
        

          Another option for black on turn 3 would be to shoot at red in C2 -
          however usually this is only a viable option if red is exactly in the
          corner, as it will mean that missing red on the right leaves no double
          target for yellow. Alternatively, another option would be for black to
          join up with red near C2, about 3-4 feet south of it. Doing so leaves
          no double target from B baulk and gives good break prospects to black
          if yellow misses the 13 yarder, although it must be remembered that
          yellow also has good prospects if it hits the 13 yarder. Black joining
          up with red also leaves a defensive shot for yellow at blue from C3 to
          C4 which, if missed, leaves black a very long and tricky takeoff from
          C2 to the east boundary.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a C2 ball
            


Response to C2 / C4 ball after Supershot opening

          The third-turn response to this option depends greatly on your ability
          and also the ability of your opponent. Before you lay the supershot,
          you need to ask yourself "am I realistically good enough to play a
          third-turn break to 4-back?". If the answer is no, then that does not
          mean that the supershot opening is a bad idea at all, but it just
          means that you may want to reassess your third-turn response.
          Additionally, if you are playing someone that you believe is much
          better than you are, then trying to give yourself a 4-ball break on
          turn 5 is exactly what you should be trying to achieve. Therefore,
          instead of trying to roquet the 13 yard shot of black at red just
          south of C2 (or just north of C4), you can instead look to join up
          with the ball 3-4 feet away, ensuring to leave no double target. This
          puts a great deal of pressure on your stronger opponent to then hit a
          13 yarder or else concede a 4-ball break to you.
        

          If you believe you are good enough to hit on turn 3 and play a break,
          then the answer is simple - hit red near C2 and go round.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / C2 ball
            


Response to EB ball after Supershot opening

          In most cases, the third-turn response to a max distance ball is to
          try and hit it from C3, missing into C4. Again, however, you should
          evaluate your own likelihood of playing a break to 4-back with only 3
          balls on the lawn if you hit, and so you may want to consider lagging
          to the ball, a couple of yards in-lawn from the east boundary.
        

          If the ball on the east boundary is south of the peg, it is tempting
          to simply shoot at it from A baulk. Missing will of course leave a
          double from B baulk, but the odds of yellow then hitting a double
          target from 20+ yards is no certainty. Alternatively, if the
          second-turn ball is around peg-high, then shooting at it from B baulk
          from a few yards west of C3 and missing often results in a fairly even
          spread of the balls, with your black ball being approximately 8 yards
          south of red and 8 yards north of C4. This again is technically a
          double target from somewhere on B Baulk, but given the distance
          between red and black, is easily missed and will leave your black ball
          a shot of only 8 yards.

              ball
            


Response to C4 ball after EB opening

          This opening creates one of the more interesting third-turn decisions.
          A second-turn ball 6" north of C4 is a very threatening position and
          therefore the options will as follows:
        


            Shoot at partner
            
Hit - set a dream leave

                Miss - leaves yellow a 13-yard shot at red in C4 for a 4-ball
                break
              



            Shoot at opponent near C4 from A baulk
            

                Hit - set a dream leave (you may want to have a go at gaining a
                rush to H1 on partner)
              

                Miss - leave a 13-yard double for yellow (but slightly tricky
                break pick-up)
              



            Join up with opponent near C4, leaving no double
            

                If red is 3-6" north of C4 - join a yard north of it from A
                baulk
                
No short double target is left for yellow

                    Yellow still only has a 13-yard shot for the innings (but a
                    slightly tricky break pick-up)
                  



                If red is ~12" north of C4 - shoot from C3 through to C4
                

                    Enables black to have a shot (albeit very long) to attempt
                    to hit and set a dream leave
                  




Black to C2


              By burying itself in C2, this enables black to kill off the
              aggression by red and yellow. Any miss by yellow will leave a 9
              yarder (at most) for blue
            






              Some common third-ball responses to a C4 ball
            



          A personal preference of mine is to shoot third-turn at the ball near
          C4 from A baulk, because hitting gives me control of the court, and I
          miss often enough by more than several inches so as not to leave a
          double.
        

          Be on the lookout for cannons around C4 as part of this opening -
          there is often a good opportunity to bombard a live ball across to H1
          while playing a croquet stroke towards blue on the east boundary. This
          can make picking up the first break a great deal easier.
        
Response to duffer tice after EB opening

          The duffer tice is one of my favourite openings. Because of the
          placement of red near H6, a miss by black from the end of B baulk will
          be headed towards A baulk and give an easy start for yellow. That is
          why we see the ~9 yard shot at red refused so often, even by very
          strong players!
        

          If black does decide to shoot at the duffer and hits, then not a great
          deal of options are available other than to take off to partner ball
          (usually nudging red towards the peg in the process), and leave a rush
          towards red, and then hope for a fourth-turn miss by yellow.
        

          Another option for shooting at the duffer is doing so from C3,
          shooting across the court and missing to around peg-high (or just
          south of peg-high) on the west boundary. This is the most defensive
          shot available in that a miss gives no break to yellow if yellow hits
          red, but it also does not put any pressure on yellow's shot at red.
          Often times, when black misses the shot from C3 at red, it will end up
          south of peg-high on the west boundary and be a tempting free shot for
          yellow from C1.
        

          Shooting at partner ball on turn 3 is the most aggressive line of play
          - taking the shot from A baulk and hitting gives the opportunity to
          play a big croquet stroke loading partner to H2 and attempting to get
          a rush to H1 on the duffer ball - it is a big shot and the break
          chances are normally only reasonable for very strong players. Missing
          partner from A baulk on the other hand gives yellow a ~9 yard shot and
          very strong break prospects. It is therefore more usual to see black
          shoot at blue from C3 which, although longer, doesn't make all the
          balls available to yellow if black misses blue and yellow hits red. It
          also means that blue and black maintain a wide join and have realistic
          prospects of hitting back in if yellow misses red.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a duffer tice
            


Response to 2 balls on EB

          If red has shot at blue on turn 2 and missed, leaving both balls on
          the east boundary, you should carefully evaluate your response based
          on the strength of your opponent. If you and your opponent are evenly
          matched but not world class players, or especially if your opponent is
          a much stronger player than you, then the best thing to do here may be
          to simply ignore the two balls on the east boundary and lag black into
          the middle of the court and wait for yellow to miss. This potentially
          presents you with an immediate break with a ball in the middle of the
          court.
        

          In a match between two very strong players it would be unusual to see
          no shot taken on turn 3, and if hit, some attempt at digging out a
          3-ball break.
        
Response to 2 balls in-court

          In a situation where you have laid a supershot with blue, and red has
          lagged a couple of yards north east of your supershot ball, if there
          is no double target to be had from anywhere on the baulk lines, you
          must again consider your expectations after hitting third turn vs your
          opponent's likelihood of hitting fourth turn. As with previous
          options, if you are playing an opponent who on paper is a much
          stronger player, the percentage play is usually to lag the black ball
          into the middle of the court beside the other two balls (being mindful
          not to leave a double target from anywhere), which will put pressure
          on your stronger opponent to hit in or else concede the first break
          opportunity to you.
        

          If you do want to shoot with black at one of the balls in the middle,
          then consider either shooting at the easterly ball from C1 (you may
          even be able to shoot hard at this without missing to B baulk), or
          alternatively shooting at a medium pace at either blue or red from the
          closest point on A baulk. If you do shoot from the closest point, be
          sure to hit at a pace to finish slightly south of H6, both so that
          black is not a short shot from B baulk, and so that any double target
          that you leave has plenty of space between the front and back ball.
        

          If you are facing a third turn shot with black after red has
          cross-wired blue and red at the peg, check first to see if there is a
          point which you can lag to where blue won't be wired from black, and
          which won't be giving a double target from either baulk line - if
          there is such a spot, then that is the best place to lag to.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to supershot lag
            


Back to top



 Fourth Ball Options
      

The fourth-turn response is usually actually more simple than then third-turn response - although there are more possible scenarios, they almost always result in yellow trying to roquet something.  
      

Response to ignored WB tice
When black has ignored a standard west boundary tice and insetad shot at (and missed) partner on the east boundary, the obvious response is to then try and hit red yourself from C1.  If the placement of red is good, you should have ~50% chance of hitting in.  Your break prospects after hitting red are actually quite good, as you will play a take off from red to blue & black, which will automatically be sending red towards H2 as a pioneer.  On the other hand, a miss with yellow through red into C2 only gives fairly mediocre break prospects to blue & black in the next turn.
Response to missed WB tice
If black did indeed shoot at red (and miss) from C1 in the previous turn, then the obvious response is to shoot at red yourself, but from a point east of C1 so that a miss will leave yellow joined with red.  If you hit red, your best line of play would be to roll red &  yellow towards C1 and lay a rush for your next turn.  A miss from red at yellow will of course leave black a shot through red and yellow from C2 to C1 but is likely to be a very long shot at a single ball target.  A miss from black on turn 5 here also gives you a good chance at establishing a break on turn 5.  




              If black has missed the standard tice, it leaves a good opportunity to join up with red on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C2 ball after EB opening
Having played red into C2 on turn 2, if black ignores red and simply joins with blue (which is likely), then against most players your best line of play would be to shoot at blue and black with red.  Whether you shoot from A baulk or B baulk depends on factors such as the distance between blue and black (whether it is easy to make a double target from B baulk or A baulk) and the flatness of the east boundary.  If the black ball missed blue badly on the left on turn 3, blue and black may well be 2+ yards apart on the east boundary, so there is a defensive option available to yellow as well - shoot from C3 through to C4, where a miss would not give blue & black any easy opening.
If you are the weaker player against a very strong opponent, then there is a case for shooting yellow at red - at 13 yards, it is significantly shorter than any other available shot and is therefore your best chance at winning the opening.  Red missing yellow gives blue a relatively easy start and a probable break, but against a very strong opponent it can still be worth the risk.  




              Fourth-turn responses for yellow when partner is in C2 and opponent balls are on the east boundary.  
            


Response to joined / missed C2 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, if black has for some reason shot at red in C2, then assuming a double target has been left, your best aggressive option is to shoot at this, preferably hitting the northern ball, from B baulk.  A hit or a miss here will give fairly good break prospects to whomever plays the next shot, given C2's proximity to H2 - a semi-good pioneer can usually be sent to H2 while obtaining a rush to H1.
If black has instead joined up a yard south of red on turn 2, you have no double target (except from C1, but let's not consider that).  Now you have fundamentally two options - either shoot yellow at red which will give a good break opportunity if hit (and concede a good break opportunity to black if missed), or take a more defensive line by shooting yellow at blue from C3 into C4.  If yellow misses this shot, it does give black a 1-yard roquet at red for the innings, however it not only gives no break prospects, but also requires black to play several good strokes in order to have a good leave.  Black's take off from C2 to blue on the east boundary is a difficult shot, and if black doesn't succeed in roqueting blue in its next shot (either taking off short and missing blue, or taking off too far and sending black out) then yellow will have a 9-10 yard shot at blue & black from near C4.




              If black has joined a yard south of red near C2, the yellow has aggressive and defensive options available
            


Response to missed EB ball after Supershot opening
The response here depends a lot on both the length of the supershot ball and what option black chose on turn 3.  Firstly let's assume the most common scenario, with blue halfway between H5 and peg, and 1-2 yards west of the centre line, and red approximately peg high on the EB, and black in or near C4.  In this situation the best option is normally to shoot at red from A baulk, with a miss joining up around 1 yard north of it.  This leaves blue a 15-yarder at red & yellow but difficult break prospects for both players, whomever plays the next shot. 




              The common response after a third-turn miss by black at red to C4, is for yellow to shoot at red, joining if missing.  An aggressive line is to shoot at black.  A third option is yellow at blue, which is shorter and will win you the innings, but only gives good break prospects if red and black are near to each other
            


As the weaker player against a stronger player, a very aggressive line of play would be to shoot yellow from A baulk at black in C4 - this is very black and white, as a hit will give you a good chance for a 4-ball break and a miss will give black the same chance.  As the weaker player, you can strongly consider this option.  
Consider for a moment that black's third-turn shot missed red from A baulk, or perhaps missed red from west of C3, finishing 5-10 yards south of red.  In this case, yellow for look for possible double targets available from B baulk.  Consider, too, the shortest shot available, which is yellow at blue from A baulk - this is likely a 11-13 yard shot which, if hit, gives good break prospects to yellow because red and black are close together.
Response to ignored duffer tice
The vast majority of the time the best response to black ignoring red's duffer tice, is for yellow to shoot hard at red from B baulk.  Usually a duffer tice is only 9-10 yards and so it will be, by far, the shortest shot for yellow.




              The majority of the time, the fourth turn response would be to shoot yellow at the duffer.  Against a very strong player, you might be tempted by yellow at black in C4 which, although 3 yards longer, gives an easy start to your break
            


An expection to this would be if blue & black are joined on the east boundary leaving a good double target from A baulk, and so you may want to consider shooting at that instead.  Another option to consider is if black shot and missed blue from C3 to C4.  If you are playing against a much stronger opponent you may consider shooting yellow at black from A baulk into C4.  This shot is 3 yards longer than yellow at red from B baulk, but hitting this shot gives you vastly stronger break prospects than if you hit red first.
Response to missed duffer tice
If black misses the duffer tice (red) gently, the logical response is to shoot hard at either red from B baulk or black from A baulk (whichever is closer).  If black misses the duffer tice from C3 across to the west boundary, you may consider shooting at black from C1 through to C2, particularly if black is south of peg-high.  




              If the duffer tice is still in its original position at the start of turn 4, the general response is for yellow to shoot at red given its proximity to B baulk.  If black missed red from C3 however, it can be tempting to shoot at black from C1 on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C4 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, red a few inches north of C4 and black 1 yard north of blue, yellow's default response should be to shoot at red from A baulk.  Hitting this shot gives a great break opportunity, as it is a very natural stroke to croquet red to H2 while approaching blue & black up the east boundary.  
Response to 3 balls on EB
In this instance, you simply need to hit one of the balls on the east boundary - from either A baulk or B baulk, depending on length and available targets.
Response to 3 balls in-court
A supershot opening with lags by red and black essentially forces yellow to shoot at the closest ball.  A very black and white opening, good break prospects for both players on turn 4 or 5, depending on whether yellow hits or misses.  Often times, black will have take a gentle lag while attempting a roquet at either blue or red on turn 3, so this may also give yellow some target to shoot at on turn 4.

Conclusion
If you have gotten to the bottom of this article, you have probably realised by now that the number of opening options are vast.  This article could not hope to cover every eventuality, and nor does it present any new or unseen openings; rather it serves to talk through the options and thought processes for choosing a particular option, and I hope it has been useful.

Openings

        The opening is the battle between the two sides to be the first to gain
        the upper hand. Generally when we talk about openings in croquet, we are
        referring to the first 4 turns. At the very top level it is where games
        are won and lost, but at all levels it provides a fascinating array of
        options for bluffing and double-bluffing your opponent.
      
Opening priorities
As the stronger player

        The stronger player who is playing a dangerous but less experienced /
        weaker player will generally approach the opening with the intent of not
        giving away an easy break, and hence a more defensive mindset. Openings
        where there is a lot of grey area, balls on boundaries and in corners
        are best for this. The stronger player will generally rely on their
        better all-round game in order to win, and is more comfortable with
        digging balls out slowly into a break.
      
As the weaker player

        The weaker player should approach a game against a much stronger
        opponent with an attacking mindset - they will not be afraid to take on
        relatively short shots that give laid breaks, even if it means conceding
        a laid break if they miss. The weaker player should favour openings that
        have balls in-lawn and should be looking to put pressure on the stronger
        player to have to hit in.
      
Evenly-matched players

        It is quite common to see very aggressive, black and white, openings
        when two very strong players play against each other. The same is true
        for openings between evenly-matched players at lower levels, but
        generally to a lesser extent. A lot of the opening strategy depends on
        the individual mindset of the player, with some players naturally
        playing a more attacking game than others.
      

        Below are articles on various well-known (and some not-so-well-known)
        openings, which discuss options for placement of balls, and responses to
        them. For the purposes of simplicity, in the examples below, the balls
        will always be played in the following order:
      


 Blue
        

 Red
        


          Black
        


          Yellow
        


Note: there is no ball order or sequence in which the balls need to
          be added to the game in croquet - the above order is simply to keep
          things consistent for the diagrams and explanations.


        As you can probably imagine, the options in the opening are endless.
        This article attempts to talk through some of the most common options,
        and some of the most common responses to them, with the idea of
        clarifying some of the thought processes behind them.
      

The Dream Leave

        Many of the openings below will reference something known as the Dream
        Leave - this is a scenario where the third turn ball (black) has hit and
        arranged the court as follows:
      




            Black hit on turn 3 and set a dream leave
          



        Black has retrieved red from wherever it was on the court and placed it
        slightly in-lawn from the west boundary, north of peg-high, and left
        blue a rush to it from the east boundary. This leave gives no short shot
        for yellow, and any miss by yellow will give blue a good break
        opportunity.

 First
        Ball Options
      

East Boundary

          The most common option selected by the first ball player. A ball to
          the east boundary, somewhere between level with H4 and H5, is chosen
          due to its relative distance from both baulk lines and from H1. It is
          a completely non-threatening ball and allows the second ball player to
          dictate the nature of the game, be it defensive or aggressive.
        
In-lawn East Boundary ball

          A variation on the standard east boundary ball, the in-lawn east
          boundary ball is struck out in the same area as the standard east
          boundary ball, but purposefully left about 1 yard in from the yardline
          area. The idea behind that is so that black can play its third turn
          shot out behind blue and leave itself a rush in-court. This play
          discourages responses like a west boundary tice from red.
        
Supershot

          A supershot ball is a first-turn ball placed near the middle of the
          court, normally between H5 and peg and a couple of yards west of the
          centre line. This is the most aggressive sensible option for the first
          ball, and signals your intent to your opponent that you want no grey
          area. Given its proximity to H1, a supershot ball generally gives a
          good chance for a break for either player, depending on whether the
          third-turn, fourth-turn or fifth-turn shots are hit.
        

          There are variations on the length of the supershot, with a supershot
          played to near the peg being a poorer pioneer for H1 but having the
          advantage of lengthening any fourth-turn shot by yellow at it.
        
Anti-duffer

          This opening is an attempt to try and pre-empt the second-turn
          response and discourage a "duffer tice" by red. To lay an anti-duffer,
          you hit blue to a spot somewhere between H6 and the peg, and 1-2 yards
          west of the east boundary. The idea of placing a ball here is that if
          the opponent were to lay a duffer tice with red,
          then it gives black a good chance to hit red and take off behind blue
          for a rush to H1 on turn 3. It is a leave that is generally only used
          by strong players who have a realistic chance of a third-turn break in
          the first place.
        




              Some common first-ball scenarios
            


Unusual first-turn options

          The croquet court is a big place and so there really are endless
          options for where to place balls in the opening. Often an unusual
          option first-turn will yield good results by confusing the opponent!
        
C4 first ball

          Not often seen these days due to a preference for an east boundary
          ball 10 yards further north. A weakness of this opening is that
          shooting at partner on turn 3 and missing is liable to leave a double
          target for yellow. It also generally encourages yellow to take an
          aggressive shot on turn 4; however on a difficult lawn this opening
          can have some advantages, with any hit by yellow on turn 4 at balls in
          C4 leaving little room to promote balls into the court due to the
          close proximity to the corner.
        
C2 first ball

          Playing blue into C2 first turn can often catch the opponent off
          guard. This opening attempts to flip the tables on red and yellow by
          trying to ensure a defensive opening for blue and black. This can be a
          good option where blue and black are the stronger players and want to
          prevent aggressive second-turn options by red and yellow. Of course,
          there are options available to red and yellow which negate blue and
          black's defensive preferences.
        
Micro tice

          As unusual options go, this is right up there. This option would not
          be recommended when playing a strong player, but nevertheless is very
          interesting. The micro tice is a ball played from the end of A baulk
          towards the east boundary, but only 2-3 yards towards it, leaving a
          2-3 yard roquet for the opponent on the second turn. This length of
          shot cannot really be refused, but leaving red a croquet stroke from
          south-west of hoop 4 on the second turn of the game gives no real
          break prospects. Often the second turn player will attempt an approach
          to H1 and fail it, leaving a 6-yard roquet with two balls near H1 for
          black. This opening relies more on a tactical mistake from red than
          anything else
        
C1 / C3 opening

          Occasionally seen. Not a good opening against any experienced
          opponent, but occasionally yields results. This first-turn option is
          not to be recommended. A first-turn ball in C1 followed by a
          second-turn response to C3 (or vice versa) is a killer blow to black's
          turn.

 Second
        Ball Options
      


          This is where things start to get a little interesting. For the most
          part, the opening is dictated by the second ball response, and there
          are many more options available.
        
Response to East Boundary ball
Standard Tice

          The standard tice is one of the most popular responses to an east
          boundary ball at club-level croquet. Although in recent years it has
          fallen out of favour with top players (likely due to an increase in
          the standard of shooting), it is still a great opening that gives good
          chances to both sides.
        

          The standard tice is where red is played to the west boundary, and the
          distance it is placed north of C1 needs to be carefully considered by
          the striker or red. The name "tice" indicates that the distance should
          be enticing for the player of black to shoot at and so a distance of
          between about 8 and 13 yards is common. As a general rule, if possible
          the distance chosen should either be about 1 yard longer than the
          opponent's critical distance (the distance at which someone hits 50%
          of their shots) or 1 yard shorter (or equal to) your own critical
          distance. Obviously this cannot be achieved if your opponent has a
          longer critical distance than you do, so it is better to err slightly
          on the longer side.
        

          If blue is an in-lawn east boundary ball, laying a standard tice is
          risky, as black can quite easily lay a rush directly to it on the
          third turn.
        
C2 ball

          Probably the most common response to the east boundary ball today is
          the second-turn ball to 6" south of C2. The reason for playing just
          south of C2 is that if in the unlikely event of black shooting at red
          on turn 3, a miss will likely leave yellow a double target. The idea
          of red near C2 means that red is buried in a defensive position, and
          signals yellow's intent to shoot at blue and black on turn 4.
        

          If blue is slightly in-lawn, then C2 is the safest and most defensive
          response with red.
        
Duffer tice

          One of the more aggressive responses for red is the duffer tice. This
          is a ball that is placed usually about 2-feet north and a few inches
          east of penultimate. This is similarly enticing for the opponent to
          shoot (just as with a standard tice) but in this case a miss is
          usually more critical - any third turn shot at the duffer is in the
          direction of A baulk so black usually takes the shot gently - and by
          doing so is more likely to miss. Black missing leaves two balls in the
          centre of the court, giving yellow a great chance on turn 4. The
          duffer tice is a great option for weaker players playing against
          stronger players, and also for anyone confident in hitting 10 yarders.
        

          Between two very strong players a duffer tice is still a popular
          opening. There are variations on the placement of the ball near
          penult, based on the strength of the opponent. It is common to see a
          duffer tice placed level with, or south of, H6, particularly if the
          striker of red and yellow is a very good shot and is confident to hit
          an 11-yarder on turn 4. In a game between experts, the placement of
          red is sometimes moved to the west of H6 to discourage a third-turn
          break after a hit from black at blue.
        
C4 ball

          This option is very popular in New Zealand and although a mirror image
          of the C2 ball, is a lot more aggressive. Placing red 6" north of C4
          not only gives negligible break prospects to black on turn 3 but also
          signals your intent to hit fourth-turn with yellow and have a break. A
          miss at partner by black on turn 3 gives you a 13-yard shot for a
          4-ball break, and a miss by black at red on turn 3 usually gives a
          double target.
        
Shoot at first-turn ball

          A slightly counter-intuitive option but nonetheless an interesting
          one. Shooting red at blue on turn 2 and hitting gives no break
          prospects, but a miss also leaves very slim break prospects for black
          on turn 3 if it hits, unless black is a very strong player. With this
          opening it is quite common to see misses on both turns 2 and 3, and
          often a triple target for yellow at the other 3 balls on turn 4 from B
          baulk.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to east boundary opening
            


Response to Supershot ball

          The supershot ball is the most aggressive opening that the first-turn
          player can use. There are several responses to this which need to be
          considered, based on your assessment of your opponent's ability and
          whether the opponent has realistic prospects of a break to 4-back if
          they do manage to hit 3rd turn.
        
C2 response

          The C2 response is a ball played about 6" south of C2. This is a
          strong response to a supershot against almost all players. If the
          player of black wants to attempt a third-turn break, they will have to
          hit a 13-yarder and play a very difficult croquet stroke out of C2 to
          get a rush to H1, and this is by no means guaranteed. On the other
          hand, a miss by black at red on turn 3 will leave yellow a double
          target and a 4-ball break if hit.
        




              It is important to finish a few inches south of C2 with red as it
              will mean black missing on either side of it will leave a double
              target. Above is a comparison of yellow's target after a
              third-turn miss by black at red, firstly with red in C2 and
              secondly with red a few inches south of C2
            



          There are only a handful of players in the world where the C2 ball is
          not a great response - players who would expect to hit the 13 yarder
          most of the time and also be good enough at croquet strokes to expect
          to get a rush to H1 on the supershot ball. Against these players the
          strategy of lengthing the 3rd turn shot would be preferred.
        
C4 response

          Mirror image to the C2 response, this ball is played 6" north of C4.
          Consider this if blue (the supershot ball) is placed further north
          than normal (somewhere near peg-high), or is in a particular spot
          which may have H4 obscuring any croquet stroke from C4 towards it. It
          otherwise gives all the same advantages as the C2 response
        
Max Distance response

          As a counter to the very top players hitting the ball in C2 most of
          the time, the max distance response became popular - this is where red
          is played to the east boundary about level with the peg on the east
          boundary, leaving the longest shot possible for black. This response
          grants black a shot from C3 through red and into C4, reducing yellow's
          fourth-turn prospects - it relies more on black missing red than
          trying to make any break pick-up by black more difficult. Generally a
          good option against the very best players, but against most players is
          unnecessary.  
The reason why max distance on the east boundary is chosen instead of the equivalent max distance spot on the west boundary is that it is slightly further from the supershot ball (blue), which is slightly south-west of the peg.  Assuming that the shots on turns 3 and 4 are missed, blue's shot at red & yellow on the east boundary will be a couple of yards longer than the equivalent shot to the west boundary.  
Supershot lag

          The response for red to lag to a spot 3-4 yards east and 1-2 yards
          north of the supershot ball is a very strong and very under-used
          response to the supershot. This is a good tactic when playing someone
          who is a very good shot, and in particular if the supershot ball
          itself is quite deep (nearer the peg than H5). Placing red beside blue
          nullifies the strength of black's shooting by encouraging black to
          take its third turn shot gently (which is generally less accurate), or
          risk shooting hard and missing into B baulk, conceding a 4-ball break.
          In this case, black may choose not to shoot at all, and instead also
          lag to a position wide of the other two balls, meaning that red and
          yellow have successfully turned the tables of the supershot opening
          and enabled yellow to have the first attempted roquet.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to supershot opening
            


Roquet the Supershot ball

          The ultimate way to nullify the supershot ball - roquet it on the
          second turn. After roqueting blue with red, there are several options
          available. You can croquet blue towards C2 and then fire red off 6"
          north of C4. A more aggressive option would be to croquet blue
          north-west of H2 and fire red off the south boundary, south of H4 -
          this leaves black a choice of 7-8 yarders but minimal break prospects
          and difficult strokes with their third turn in order to distance the
          balls from baulk. A more novel option would be to crosswire blue and
          red at the peg, which leaves only a 17-yard shot for black with a
          baulk line in the background. An even more interesting option might be
          to roll blue close to the peg, either east or west, and then play red
          a yard or two away from it, wiring blue's backswing at red. This means
          that black probably has no lag option towards blue that doesn't leave
          a double-target for yellow.
        
Response to unusual first-turn options
Response to a first-turn C2 ball

          A first-turn C2 ball is an attempt by blue to make red conform to a
          defensive opening. Red could of course do this if it wants, by playing
          6" north of C4, or even by just having a "standard" east boundary
          ball; however a better option to negate blue's attempt at dictating
          the opening might be to set a duffer tice - this is the ultimate
          aggressive response to the C2 ball, and means that black is suddenly
          faced with having to hit a 10-13 yarder on turn 3 or risk leaving the
          same for yellow next turn, and a laid break.
        
Back to top



 Third
        Ball Options
      

        For the vast majority of players, if they manage to hit in on the third
        turn of the game, they will and should be looking to make a dream leave
        (see top of page) or similar, possibly with red near the peg and blue &
        black with a rush towards it. There are exceptions to this line of play,
        mainly with supershot openings, but unless otherwise stated, the
        standard play would be to try and set a dream leave.
      

Response to WB tice after EB opening

          Realistically, black will not be attempting to make any break on turn
          3 if it manages to hit in. The player of black has to make a judgement
          call on their likelihood of hitting the standard tice vs their
          opponent's likelihood of missing it.
        


            If the tice is long, the best response is probably to shoot black at
            blue from A baulk. Missing black at blue leaves the free shot at the
            tice for yellow of course, which does give yellow fairly good
            prospects if hit. If the tice is extremely long, say peg-high, then
            black could quite feasibly just lag at blue and attempt to leave a
            rush to red. Bear in mind that playing this lag so early in the game
            may be difficult as you may not have the pace of the court - and
            there is a risk that lagging at blue and falling short will leave
            yellow a double target on turn 4.
          

            Another option if black is uncertain, would be to shoot at blue from
            C3, and missing through to C4. This hedges black's bets somewhat, as
            it is still taking a shot at a ball and still somewhat joining with
            partner ball, but does not give good break prospects to the opponent
            if yellow hits, due to the proximity of blue and black to one
            another. Yellow is faced with a long takeoff from red towards blue
            and black and in all likelihood will not get a rush to H1 from this
            position.
          

            The third option is of course to shoot at the tice itself. Hitting
            red will give the opportunity to make a dream leave (as shown at the
            top of the page). Missing red will send black towards C2, which will
            give black a free shot back through red and yellow if yellow misses
            its fourth-turn shot at red.
          





              Some common third-ball responses to a standard tice
            


Response to C2 ball after EB opening

          There are two common options after a second-turn C2 ball - both
          consist of shooting at partner. If partner is hit, then usually the
          play will be to take off to the red in C2, roquet it and then croquet
          it either into the centre of the court, or along the west boundary,
          then lag back to partner and leave a rush in-court. However, consider
          a game where you are the stronger player playing a very capable weaker
          player, if you do hit partner third turn, you can elect to just set a
          rush to the C2 ball instead of trying to retrieve it from C2. As the
          stronger player you may prefer this line of play, instead of digging
          out the C2 ball only for your opponent to hit on turn 4 and have an
          easy break.
        

          Usually the third-turn shot at partner with black will be from A
          baulk, joining up on the east boundary if missed. This leaves a long
          double target for yellow from the end of B baulk. A more defensive
          play would be to shoot at partner from C3 into C4. Doing this leaves
          almost no break prospects fourth-turn for yellow but, depending on the
          distance between blue and black, may give them the opportunity to join
          up.
        

          Another option for black on turn 3 would be to shoot at red in C2 -
          however usually this is only a viable option if red is exactly in the
          corner, as it will mean that missing red on the right leaves no double
          target for yellow. Alternatively, another option would be for black to
          join up with red near C2, about 3-4 feet south of it. Doing so leaves
          no double target from B baulk and gives good break prospects to black
          if yellow misses the 13 yarder, although it must be remembered that
          yellow also has good prospects if it hits the 13 yarder. Black joining
          up with red also leaves a defensive shot for yellow at blue from C3 to
          C4 which, if missed, leaves black a very long and tricky takeoff from
          C2 to the east boundary.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a C2 ball
            


Response to C2 / C4 ball after Supershot opening

          The third-turn response to this option depends greatly on your ability
          and also the ability of your opponent. Before you lay the supershot,
          you need to ask yourself "am I realistically good enough to play a
          third-turn break to 4-back?". If the answer is no, then that does not
          mean that the supershot opening is a bad idea at all, but it just
          means that you may want to reassess your third-turn response.
          Additionally, if you are playing someone that you believe is much
          better than you are, then trying to give yourself a 4-ball break on
          turn 5 is exactly what you should be trying to achieve. Therefore,
          instead of trying to roquet the 13 yard shot of black at red just
          south of C2 (or just north of C4), you can instead look to join up
          with the ball 3-4 feet away, ensuring to leave no double target. This
          puts a great deal of pressure on your stronger opponent to then hit a
          13 yarder or else concede a 4-ball break to you.
        

          If you believe you are good enough to hit on turn 3 and play a break,
          then the answer is simple - hit red near C2 and go round.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / C2 ball
            


Response to EB ball after Supershot opening

          In most cases, the third-turn response to a max distance ball is to
          try and hit it from C3, missing into C4. Again, however, you should
          evaluate your own likelihood of playing a break to 4-back with only 3
          balls on the lawn if you hit, and so you may want to consider lagging
          to the ball, a couple of yards in-lawn from the east boundary.
        

          If the ball on the east boundary is south of the peg, it is tempting
          to simply shoot at it from A baulk. Missing will of course leave a
          double from B baulk, but the odds of yellow then hitting a double
          target from 20+ yards is no certainty. Alternatively, if the
          second-turn ball is around peg-high, then shooting at it from B baulk
          from a few yards west of C3 and missing often results in a fairly even
          spread of the balls, with your black ball being approximately 8 yards
          south of red and 8 yards north of C4. This again is technically a
          double target from somewhere on B Baulk, but given the distance
          between red and black, is easily missed and will leave your black ball
          a shot of only 8 yards.

              ball
            


Response to C4 ball after EB opening

          This opening creates one of the more interesting third-turn decisions.
          A second-turn ball 6" north of C4 is a very threatening position and
          therefore the options will as follows:
        


            Shoot at partner
            
Hit - set a dream leave

                Miss - leaves yellow a 13-yard shot at red in C4 for a 4-ball
                break
              



            Shoot at opponent near C4 from A baulk
            

                Hit - set a dream leave (you may want to have a go at gaining a
                rush to H1 on partner)
              

                Miss - leave a 13-yard double for yellow (but slightly tricky
                break pick-up)
              



            Join up with opponent near C4, leaving no double
            

                If red is 3-6" north of C4 - join a yard north of it from A
                baulk
                
No short double target is left for yellow

                    Yellow still only has a 13-yard shot for the innings (but a
                    slightly tricky break pick-up)
                  



                If red is ~12" north of C4 - shoot from C3 through to C4
                

                    Enables black to have a shot (albeit very long) to attempt
                    to hit and set a dream leave
                  




Black to C2


              By burying itself in C2, this enables black to kill off the
              aggression by red and yellow. Any miss by yellow will leave a 9
              yarder (at most) for blue
            






              Some common third-ball responses to a C4 ball
            



          A personal preference of mine is to shoot third-turn at the ball near
          C4 from A baulk, because hitting gives me control of the court, and I
          miss often enough by more than several inches so as not to leave a
          double.
        

          Be on the lookout for cannons around C4 as part of this opening -
          there is often a good opportunity to bombard a live ball across to H1
          while playing a croquet stroke towards blue on the east boundary. This
          can make picking up the first break a great deal easier.
        
Response to duffer tice after EB opening

          The duffer tice is one of my favourite openings. Because of the
          placement of red near H6, a miss by black from the end of B baulk will
          be headed towards A baulk and give an easy start for yellow. That is
          why we see the ~9 yard shot at red refused so often, even by very
          strong players!
        

          If black does decide to shoot at the duffer and hits, then not a great
          deal of options are available other than to take off to partner ball
          (usually nudging red towards the peg in the process), and leave a rush
          towards red, and then hope for a fourth-turn miss by yellow.
        

          Another option for shooting at the duffer is doing so from C3,
          shooting across the court and missing to around peg-high (or just
          south of peg-high) on the west boundary. This is the most defensive
          shot available in that a miss gives no break to yellow if yellow hits
          red, but it also does not put any pressure on yellow's shot at red.
          Often times, when black misses the shot from C3 at red, it will end up
          south of peg-high on the west boundary and be a tempting free shot for
          yellow from C1.
        

          Shooting at partner ball on turn 3 is the most aggressive line of play
          - taking the shot from A baulk and hitting gives the opportunity to
          play a big croquet stroke loading partner to H2 and attempting to get
          a rush to H1 on the duffer ball - it is a big shot and the break
          chances are normally only reasonable for very strong players. Missing
          partner from A baulk on the other hand gives yellow a ~9 yard shot and
          very strong break prospects. It is therefore more usual to see black
          shoot at blue from C3 which, although longer, doesn't make all the
          balls available to yellow if black misses blue and yellow hits red. It
          also means that blue and black maintain a wide join and have realistic
          prospects of hitting back in if yellow misses red.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a duffer tice
            


Response to 2 balls on EB

          If red has shot at blue on turn 2 and missed, leaving both balls on
          the east boundary, you should carefully evaluate your response based
          on the strength of your opponent. If you and your opponent are evenly
          matched but not world class players, or especially if your opponent is
          a much stronger player than you, then the best thing to do here may be
          to simply ignore the two balls on the east boundary and lag black into
          the middle of the court and wait for yellow to miss. This potentially
          presents you with an immediate break with a ball in the middle of the
          court.
        

          In a match between two very strong players it would be unusual to see
          no shot taken on turn 3, and if hit, some attempt at digging out a
          3-ball break.
        
Response to 2 balls in-court

          In a situation where you have laid a supershot with blue, and red has
          lagged a couple of yards north east of your supershot ball, if there
          is no double target to be had from anywhere on the baulk lines, you
          must again consider your expectations after hitting third turn vs your
          opponent's likelihood of hitting fourth turn. As with previous
          options, if you are playing an opponent who on paper is a much
          stronger player, the percentage play is usually to lag the black ball
          into the middle of the court beside the other two balls (being mindful
          not to leave a double target from anywhere), which will put pressure
          on your stronger opponent to hit in or else concede the first break
          opportunity to you.
        

          If you do want to shoot with black at one of the balls in the middle,
          then consider either shooting at the easterly ball from C1 (you may
          even be able to shoot hard at this without missing to B baulk), or
          alternatively shooting at a medium pace at either blue or red from the
          closest point on A baulk. If you do shoot from the closest point, be
          sure to hit at a pace to finish slightly south of H6, both so that
          black is not a short shot from B baulk, and so that any double target
          that you leave has plenty of space between the front and back ball.
        

          If you are facing a third turn shot with black after red has
          cross-wired blue and red at the peg, check first to see if there is a
          point which you can lag to where blue won't be wired from black, and
          which won't be giving a double target from either baulk line - if
          there is such a spot, then that is the best place to lag to.

 Fourth Ball Options
      

The fourth-turn response is usually actually more simple than then third-turn response - although there are more possible scenarios, they almost always result in yellow trying to roquet something.  
      

Response to ignored WB tice
When black has ignored a standard west boundary tice and insetad shot at (and missed) partner on the east boundary, the obvious response is to then try and hit red yourself from C1.  If the placement of red is good, you should have ~50% chance of hitting in.  Your break prospects after hitting red are actually quite good, as you will play a take off from red to blue & black, which will automatically be sending red towards H2 as a pioneer.  On the other hand, a miss with yellow through red into C2 only gives fairly mediocre break prospects to blue & black in the next turn.
Response to missed WB tice
If black did indeed shoot at red (and miss) from C1 in the previous turn, then the obvious response is to shoot at red yourself, but from a point east of C1 so that a miss will leave yellow joined with red.  If you hit red, your best line of play would be to roll red &  yellow towards C1 and lay a rush for your next turn.  A miss from red at yellow will of course leave black a shot through red and yellow from C2 to C1 but is likely to be a very long shot at a single ball target.  A miss from black on turn 5 here also gives you a good chance at establishing a break on turn 5.  




              If black has missed the standard tice, it leaves a good opportunity to join up with red on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C2 ball after EB opening
Having played red into C2 on turn 2, if black ignores red and simply joins with blue (which is likely), then against most players your best line of play would be to shoot at blue and black with red.  Whether you shoot from A baulk or B baulk depends on factors such as the distance between blue and black (whether it is easy to make a double target from B baulk or A baulk) and the flatness of the east boundary.  If the black ball missed blue badly on the left on turn 3, blue and black may well be 2+ yards apart on the east boundary, so there is a defensive option available to yellow as well - shoot from C3 through to C4, where a miss would not give blue & black any easy opening.
If you are the weaker player against a very strong opponent, then there is a case for shooting yellow at red - at 13 yards, it is significantly shorter than any other available shot and is therefore your best chance at winning the opening.  Red missing yellow gives blue a relatively easy start and a probable break, but against a very strong opponent it can still be worth the risk.  




              Fourth-turn responses for yellow when partner is in C2 and opponent balls are on the east boundary.  
            


Response to joined / missed C2 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, if black has for some reason shot at red in C2, then assuming a double target has been left, your best aggressive option is to shoot at this, preferably hitting the northern ball, from B baulk.  A hit or a miss here will give fairly good break prospects to whomever plays the next shot, given C2's proximity to H2 - a semi-good pioneer can usually be sent to H2 while obtaining a rush to H1.
If black has instead joined up a yard south of red on turn 2, you have no double target (except from C1, but let's not consider that).  Now you have fundamentally two options - either shoot yellow at red which will give a good break opportunity if hit (and concede a good break opportunity to black if missed), or take a more defensive line by shooting yellow at blue from C3 into C4.  If yellow misses this shot, it does give black a 1-yard roquet at red for the innings, however it not only gives no break prospects, but also requires black to play several good strokes in order to have a good leave.  Black's take off from C2 to blue on the east boundary is a difficult shot, and if black doesn't succeed in roqueting blue in its next shot (either taking off short and missing blue, or taking off too far and sending black out) then yellow will have a 9-10 yard shot at blue & black from near C4.




              If black has joined a yard south of red near C2, the yellow has aggressive and defensive options available
            


Response to missed EB ball after Supershot opening
The response here depends a lot on both the length of the supershot ball and what option black chose on turn 3.  Firstly let's assume the most common scenario, with blue halfway between H5 and peg, and 1-2 yards west of the centre line, and red approximately peg high on the EB, and black in or near C4.  In this situation the best option is normally to shoot at red from A baulk, with a miss joining up around 1 yard north of it.  This leaves blue a 15-yarder at red & yellow but difficult break prospects for both players, whomever plays the next shot. 




              The common response after a third-turn miss by black at red to C4, is for yellow to shoot at red, joining if missing.  An aggressive line is to shoot at black.  A third option is yellow at blue, which is shorter and will win you the innings, but only gives good break prospects if red and black are near to each other
            


As the weaker player against a stronger player, a very aggressive line of play would be to shoot yellow from A baulk at black in C4 - this is very black and white, as a hit will give you a good chance for a 4-ball break and a miss will give black the same chance.  As the weaker player, you can strongly consider this option.  
Consider for a moment that black's third-turn shot missed red from A baulk, or perhaps missed red from west of C3, finishing 5-10 yards south of red.  In this case, yellow for look for possible double targets available from B baulk.  Consider, too, the shortest shot available, which is yellow at blue from A baulk - this is likely a 11-13 yard shot which, if hit, gives good break prospects to yellow because red and black are close together.
Response to ignored duffer tice
The vast majority of the time the best response to black ignoring red's duffer tice, is for yellow to shoot hard at red from B baulk.  Usually a duffer tice is only 9-10 yards and so it will be, by far, the shortest shot for yellow.




              The majority of the time, the fourth turn response would be to shoot yellow at the duffer.  Against a very strong player, you might be tempted by yellow at black in C4 which, although 3 yards longer, gives an easy start to your break
            


An expection to this would be if blue & black are joined on the east boundary leaving a good double target from A baulk, and so you may want to consider shooting at that instead.  Another option to consider is if black shot and missed blue from C3 to C4.  If you are playing against a much stronger opponent you may consider shooting yellow at black from A baulk into C4.  This shot is 3 yards longer than yellow at red from B baulk, but hitting this shot gives you vastly stronger break prospects than if you hit red first.
Response to missed duffer tice
If black misses the duffer tice (red) gently, the logical response is to shoot hard at either red from B baulk or black from A baulk (whichever is closer).  If black misses the duffer tice from C3 across to the west boundary, you may consider shooting at black from C1 through to C2, particularly if black is south of peg-high.  




              If the duffer tice is still in its original position at the start of turn 4, the general response is for yellow to shoot at red given its proximity to B baulk.  If black missed red from C3 however, it can be tempting to shoot at black from C1 on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C4 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, red a few inches north of C4 and black 1 yard north of blue, yellow's default response should be to shoot at red from A baulk.  Hitting this shot gives a great break opportunity, as it is a very natural stroke to croquet red to H2 while approaching blue & black up the east boundary.  
Response to 3 balls on EB
In this instance, you simply need to hit one of the balls on the east boundary - from either A baulk or B baulk, depending on length and available targets.
Response to 3 balls in-court
A supershot opening with lags by red and black essentially forces yellow to shoot at the closest ball.  A very black and white opening, good break prospects for both players on turn 4 or 5, depending on whether yellow hits or misses.  Often times, black will have take a gentle lag while attempting a roquet at either blue or red on turn 3, so this may also give yellow some target to shoot at on turn 4.

Conclusion
If you have gotten to the bottom of this article, you have probably realised by now that the number of opening options are vast.  This article could not hope to cover every eventuality, and nor does it present any new or unseen openings; rather it serves to talk through the options and thought processes for choosing a particular option, and I hope it has been useful.

            Openings
          


Openings

        The opening is the battle between the two sides to be the first to gain
        the upper hand. Generally when we talk about openings in croquet, we are
        referring to the first 4 turns. At the very top level it is where games
        are won and lost, but at all levels it provides a fascinating array of
        options for bluffing and double-bluffing your opponent.
      
Opening priorities
As the stronger player

        The stronger player who is playing a dangerous but less experienced /
        weaker player will generally approach the opening with the intent of not
        giving away an easy break, and hence a more defensive mindset. Openings
        where there is a lot of grey area, balls on boundaries and in corners
        are best for this. The stronger player will generally rely on their
        better all-round game in order to win, and is more comfortable with
        digging balls out slowly into a break.
      
As the weaker player

        The weaker player should approach a game against a much stronger
        opponent with an attacking mindset - they will not be afraid to take on
        relatively short shots that give laid breaks, even if it means conceding
        a laid break if they miss. The weaker player should favour openings that
        have balls in-lawn and should be looking to put pressure on the stronger
        player to have to hit in.
      
Evenly-matched players

        It is quite common to see very aggressive, black and white, openings
        when two very strong players play against each other. The same is true
        for openings between evenly-matched players at lower levels, but
        generally to a lesser extent. A lot of the opening strategy depends on
        the individual mindset of the player, with some players naturally
        playing a more attacking game than others.
      

        Below are articles on various well-known (and some not-so-well-known)
        openings, which discuss options for placement of balls, and responses to
        them. For the purposes of simplicity, in the examples below, the balls
        will always be played in the following order:
      


 Blue
        

 Red
        


          Black
        


          Yellow
        


Note: there is no ball order or sequence in which the balls need to
          be added to the game in croquet - the above order is simply to keep
          things consistent for the diagrams and explanations.


        As you can probably imagine, the options in the opening are endless.
        This article attempts to talk through some of the most common options,
        and some of the most common responses to them, with the idea of
        clarifying some of the thought processes behind them.
      

The Dream Leave

        Many of the openings below will reference something known as the Dream
        Leave - this is a scenario where the third turn ball (black) has hit and
        arranged the court as follows:
      




            Black hit on turn 3 and set a dream leave
          



        Black has retrieved red from wherever it was on the court and placed it
        slightly in-lawn from the west boundary, north of peg-high, and left
        blue a rush to it from the east boundary. This leave gives no short shot
        for yellow, and any miss by yellow will give blue a good break
        opportunity.

 First
        Ball Options
      

East Boundary

          The most common option selected by the first ball player. A ball to
          the east boundary, somewhere between level with H4 and H5, is chosen
          due to its relative distance from both baulk lines and from H1. It is
          a completely non-threatening ball and allows the second ball player to
          dictate the nature of the game, be it defensive or aggressive.
        
In-lawn East Boundary ball

          A variation on the standard east boundary ball, the in-lawn east
          boundary ball is struck out in the same area as the standard east
          boundary ball, but purposefully left about 1 yard in from the yardline
          area. The idea behind that is so that black can play its third turn
          shot out behind blue and leave itself a rush in-court. This play
          discourages responses like a west boundary tice from red.
        
Supershot

          A supershot ball is a first-turn ball placed near the middle of the
          court, normally between H5 and peg and a couple of yards west of the
          centre line. This is the most aggressive sensible option for the first
          ball, and signals your intent to your opponent that you want no grey
          area. Given its proximity to H1, a supershot ball generally gives a
          good chance for a break for either player, depending on whether the
          third-turn, fourth-turn or fifth-turn shots are hit.
        

          There are variations on the length of the supershot, with a supershot
          played to near the peg being a poorer pioneer for H1 but having the
          advantage of lengthening any fourth-turn shot by yellow at it.
        
Anti-duffer

          This opening is an attempt to try and pre-empt the second-turn
          response and discourage a "duffer tice" by red. To lay an anti-duffer,
          you hit blue to a spot somewhere between H6 and the peg, and 1-2 yards
          west of the east boundary. The idea of placing a ball here is that if
          the opponent were to lay a duffer tice with red,
          then it gives black a good chance to hit red and take off behind blue
          for a rush to H1 on turn 3. It is a leave that is generally only used
          by strong players who have a realistic chance of a third-turn break in
          the first place.
        




              Some common first-ball scenarios
            


Unusual first-turn options

          The croquet court is a big place and so there really are endless
          options for where to place balls in the opening. Often an unusual
          option first-turn will yield good results by confusing the opponent!
        
C4 first ball

          Not often seen these days due to a preference for an east boundary
          ball 10 yards further north. A weakness of this opening is that
          shooting at partner on turn 3 and missing is liable to leave a double
          target for yellow. It also generally encourages yellow to take an
          aggressive shot on turn 4; however on a difficult lawn this opening
          can have some advantages, with any hit by yellow on turn 4 at balls in
          C4 leaving little room to promote balls into the court due to the
          close proximity to the corner.
        
C2 first ball

          Playing blue into C2 first turn can often catch the opponent off
          guard. This opening attempts to flip the tables on red and yellow by
          trying to ensure a defensive opening for blue and black. This can be a
          good option where blue and black are the stronger players and want to
          prevent aggressive second-turn options by red and yellow. Of course,
          there are options available to red and yellow which negate blue and
          black's defensive preferences.
        
Micro tice

          As unusual options go, this is right up there. This option would not
          be recommended when playing a strong player, but nevertheless is very
          interesting. The micro tice is a ball played from the end of A baulk
          towards the east boundary, but only 2-3 yards towards it, leaving a
          2-3 yard roquet for the opponent on the second turn. This length of
          shot cannot really be refused, but leaving red a croquet stroke from
          south-west of hoop 4 on the second turn of the game gives no real
          break prospects. Often the second turn player will attempt an approach
          to H1 and fail it, leaving a 6-yard roquet with two balls near H1 for
          black. This opening relies more on a tactical mistake from red than
          anything else
        
C1 / C3 opening

          Occasionally seen. Not a good opening against any experienced
          opponent, but occasionally yields results. This first-turn option is
          not to be recommended. A first-turn ball in C1 followed by a
          second-turn response to C3 (or vice versa) is a killer blow to black's
          turn.

 Second
        Ball Options
      


          This is where things start to get a little interesting. For the most
          part, the opening is dictated by the second ball response, and there
          are many more options available.
        
Response to East Boundary ball
Standard Tice

          The standard tice is one of the most popular responses to an east
          boundary ball at club-level croquet. Although in recent years it has
          fallen out of favour with top players (likely due to an increase in
          the standard of shooting), it is still a great opening that gives good
          chances to both sides.
        

          The standard tice is where red is played to the west boundary, and the
          distance it is placed north of C1 needs to be carefully considered by
          the striker or red. The name "tice" indicates that the distance should
          be enticing for the player of black to shoot at and so a distance of
          between about 8 and 13 yards is common. As a general rule, if possible
          the distance chosen should either be about 1 yard longer than the
          opponent's critical distance (the distance at which someone hits 50%
          of their shots) or 1 yard shorter (or equal to) your own critical
          distance. Obviously this cannot be achieved if your opponent has a
          longer critical distance than you do, so it is better to err slightly
          on the longer side.
        

          If blue is an in-lawn east boundary ball, laying a standard tice is
          risky, as black can quite easily lay a rush directly to it on the
          third turn.
        
C2 ball

          Probably the most common response to the east boundary ball today is
          the second-turn ball to 6" south of C2. The reason for playing just
          south of C2 is that if in the unlikely event of black shooting at red
          on turn 3, a miss will likely leave yellow a double target. The idea
          of red near C2 means that red is buried in a defensive position, and
          signals yellow's intent to shoot at blue and black on turn 4.
        

          If blue is slightly in-lawn, then C2 is the safest and most defensive
          response with red.
        
Duffer tice

          One of the more aggressive responses for red is the duffer tice. This
          is a ball that is placed usually about 2-feet north and a few inches
          east of penultimate. This is similarly enticing for the opponent to
          shoot (just as with a standard tice) but in this case a miss is
          usually more critical - any third turn shot at the duffer is in the
          direction of A baulk so black usually takes the shot gently - and by
          doing so is more likely to miss. Black missing leaves two balls in the
          centre of the court, giving yellow a great chance on turn 4. The
          duffer tice is a great option for weaker players playing against
          stronger players, and also for anyone confident in hitting 10 yarders.
        

          Between two very strong players a duffer tice is still a popular
          opening. There are variations on the placement of the ball near
          penult, based on the strength of the opponent. It is common to see a
          duffer tice placed level with, or south of, H6, particularly if the
          striker of red and yellow is a very good shot and is confident to hit
          an 11-yarder on turn 4. In a game between experts, the placement of
          red is sometimes moved to the west of H6 to discourage a third-turn
          break after a hit from black at blue.
        
C4 ball

          This option is very popular in New Zealand and although a mirror image
          of the C2 ball, is a lot more aggressive. Placing red 6" north of C4
          not only gives negligible break prospects to black on turn 3 but also
          signals your intent to hit fourth-turn with yellow and have a break. A
          miss at partner by black on turn 3 gives you a 13-yard shot for a
          4-ball break, and a miss by black at red on turn 3 usually gives a
          double target.
        
Shoot at first-turn ball

          A slightly counter-intuitive option but nonetheless an interesting
          one. Shooting red at blue on turn 2 and hitting gives no break
          prospects, but a miss also leaves very slim break prospects for black
          on turn 3 if it hits, unless black is a very strong player. With this
          opening it is quite common to see misses on both turns 2 and 3, and
          often a triple target for yellow at the other 3 balls on turn 4 from B
          baulk.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to east boundary opening
            


Response to Supershot ball

          The supershot ball is the most aggressive opening that the first-turn
          player can use. There are several responses to this which need to be
          considered, based on your assessment of your opponent's ability and
          whether the opponent has realistic prospects of a break to 4-back if
          they do manage to hit 3rd turn.
        
C2 response

          The C2 response is a ball played about 6" south of C2. This is a
          strong response to a supershot against almost all players. If the
          player of black wants to attempt a third-turn break, they will have to
          hit a 13-yarder and play a very difficult croquet stroke out of C2 to
          get a rush to H1, and this is by no means guaranteed. On the other
          hand, a miss by black at red on turn 3 will leave yellow a double
          target and a 4-ball break if hit.
        




              It is important to finish a few inches south of C2 with red as it
              will mean black missing on either side of it will leave a double
              target. Above is a comparison of yellow's target after a
              third-turn miss by black at red, firstly with red in C2 and
              secondly with red a few inches south of C2
            



          There are only a handful of players in the world where the C2 ball is
          not a great response - players who would expect to hit the 13 yarder
          most of the time and also be good enough at croquet strokes to expect
          to get a rush to H1 on the supershot ball. Against these players the
          strategy of lengthing the 3rd turn shot would be preferred.
        
C4 response

          Mirror image to the C2 response, this ball is played 6" north of C4.
          Consider this if blue (the supershot ball) is placed further north
          than normal (somewhere near peg-high), or is in a particular spot
          which may have H4 obscuring any croquet stroke from C4 towards it. It
          otherwise gives all the same advantages as the C2 response
        
Max Distance response

          As a counter to the very top players hitting the ball in C2 most of
          the time, the max distance response became popular - this is where red
          is played to the east boundary about level with the peg on the east
          boundary, leaving the longest shot possible for black. This response
          grants black a shot from C3 through red and into C4, reducing yellow's
          fourth-turn prospects - it relies more on black missing red than
          trying to make any break pick-up by black more difficult. Generally a
          good option against the very best players, but against most players is
          unnecessary.  
The reason why max distance on the east boundary is chosen instead of the equivalent max distance spot on the west boundary is that it is slightly further from the supershot ball (blue), which is slightly south-west of the peg.  Assuming that the shots on turns 3 and 4 are missed, blue's shot at red & yellow on the east boundary will be a couple of yards longer than the equivalent shot to the west boundary.  
Supershot lag

          The response for red to lag to a spot 3-4 yards east and 1-2 yards
          north of the supershot ball is a very strong and very under-used
          response to the supershot. This is a good tactic when playing someone
          who is a very good shot, and in particular if the supershot ball
          itself is quite deep (nearer the peg than H5). Placing red beside blue
          nullifies the strength of black's shooting by encouraging black to
          take its third turn shot gently (which is generally less accurate), or
          risk shooting hard and missing into B baulk, conceding a 4-ball break.
          In this case, black may choose not to shoot at all, and instead also
          lag to a position wide of the other two balls, meaning that red and
          yellow have successfully turned the tables of the supershot opening
          and enabled yellow to have the first attempted roquet.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to supershot opening
            


Roquet the Supershot ball

          The ultimate way to nullify the supershot ball - roquet it on the
          second turn. After roqueting blue with red, there are several options
          available. You can croquet blue towards C2 and then fire red off 6"
          north of C4. A more aggressive option would be to croquet blue
          north-west of H2 and fire red off the south boundary, south of H4 -
          this leaves black a choice of 7-8 yarders but minimal break prospects
          and difficult strokes with their third turn in order to distance the
          balls from baulk. A more novel option would be to crosswire blue and
          red at the peg, which leaves only a 17-yard shot for black with a
          baulk line in the background. An even more interesting option might be
          to roll blue close to the peg, either east or west, and then play red
          a yard or two away from it, wiring blue's backswing at red. This means
          that black probably has no lag option towards blue that doesn't leave
          a double-target for yellow.
        
Response to unusual first-turn options
Response to a first-turn C2 ball

          A first-turn C2 ball is an attempt by blue to make red conform to a
          defensive opening. Red could of course do this if it wants, by playing
          6" north of C4, or even by just having a "standard" east boundary
          ball; however a better option to negate blue's attempt at dictating
          the opening might be to set a duffer tice - this is the ultimate
          aggressive response to the C2 ball, and means that black is suddenly
          faced with having to hit a 10-13 yarder on turn 3 or risk leaving the
          same for yellow next turn, and a laid break.
        
Back to top



 Third
        Ball Options
      

        For the vast majority of players, if they manage to hit in on the third
        turn of the game, they will and should be looking to make a dream leave
        (see top of page) or similar, possibly with red near the peg and blue &
        black with a rush towards it. There are exceptions to this line of play,
        mainly with supershot openings, but unless otherwise stated, the
        standard play would be to try and set a dream leave.
      

Response to WB tice after EB opening

          Realistically, black will not be attempting to make any break on turn
          3 if it manages to hit in. The player of black has to make a judgement
          call on their likelihood of hitting the standard tice vs their
          opponent's likelihood of missing it.
        


            If the tice is long, the best response is probably to shoot black at
            blue from A baulk. Missing black at blue leaves the free shot at the
            tice for yellow of course, which does give yellow fairly good
            prospects if hit. If the tice is extremely long, say peg-high, then
            black could quite feasibly just lag at blue and attempt to leave a
            rush to red. Bear in mind that playing this lag so early in the game
            may be difficult as you may not have the pace of the court - and
            there is a risk that lagging at blue and falling short will leave
            yellow a double target on turn 4.
          

            Another option if black is uncertain, would be to shoot at blue from
            C3, and missing through to C4. This hedges black's bets somewhat, as
            it is still taking a shot at a ball and still somewhat joining with
            partner ball, but does not give good break prospects to the opponent
            if yellow hits, due to the proximity of blue and black to one
            another. Yellow is faced with a long takeoff from red towards blue
            and black and in all likelihood will not get a rush to H1 from this
            position.
          

            The third option is of course to shoot at the tice itself. Hitting
            red will give the opportunity to make a dream leave (as shown at the
            top of the page). Missing red will send black towards C2, which will
            give black a free shot back through red and yellow if yellow misses
            its fourth-turn shot at red.
          





              Some common third-ball responses to a standard tice
            


Response to C2 ball after EB opening

          There are two common options after a second-turn C2 ball - both
          consist of shooting at partner. If partner is hit, then usually the
          play will be to take off to the red in C2, roquet it and then croquet
          it either into the centre of the court, or along the west boundary,
          then lag back to partner and leave a rush in-court. However, consider
          a game where you are the stronger player playing a very capable weaker
          player, if you do hit partner third turn, you can elect to just set a
          rush to the C2 ball instead of trying to retrieve it from C2. As the
          stronger player you may prefer this line of play, instead of digging
          out the C2 ball only for your opponent to hit on turn 4 and have an
          easy break.
        

          Usually the third-turn shot at partner with black will be from A
          baulk, joining up on the east boundary if missed. This leaves a long
          double target for yellow from the end of B baulk. A more defensive
          play would be to shoot at partner from C3 into C4. Doing this leaves
          almost no break prospects fourth-turn for yellow but, depending on the
          distance between blue and black, may give them the opportunity to join
          up.
        

          Another option for black on turn 3 would be to shoot at red in C2 -
          however usually this is only a viable option if red is exactly in the
          corner, as it will mean that missing red on the right leaves no double
          target for yellow. Alternatively, another option would be for black to
          join up with red near C2, about 3-4 feet south of it. Doing so leaves
          no double target from B baulk and gives good break prospects to black
          if yellow misses the 13 yarder, although it must be remembered that
          yellow also has good prospects if it hits the 13 yarder. Black joining
          up with red also leaves a defensive shot for yellow at blue from C3 to
          C4 which, if missed, leaves black a very long and tricky takeoff from
          C2 to the east boundary.

Response to C2 / C4 ball after Supershot opening

          The third-turn response to this option depends greatly on your ability
          and also the ability of your opponent. Before you lay the supershot,
          you need to ask yourself "am I realistically good enough to play a
          third-turn break to 4-back?". If the answer is no, then that does not
          mean that the supershot opening is a bad idea at all, but it just
          means that you may want to reassess your third-turn response.
          Additionally, if you are playing someone that you believe is much
          better than you are, then trying to give yourself a 4-ball break on
          turn 5 is exactly what you should be trying to achieve. Therefore,
          instead of trying to roquet the 13 yard shot of black at red just
          south of C2 (or just north of C4), you can instead look to join up
          with the ball 3-4 feet away, ensuring to leave no double target. This
          puts a great deal of pressure on your stronger opponent to then hit a
          13 yarder or else concede a 4-ball break to you.
        

          If you believe you are good enough to hit on turn 3 and play a break,
          then the answer is simple - hit red near C2 and go round.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / C2 ball
            


Response to EB ball after Supershot opening

          In most cases, the third-turn response to a max distance ball is to
          try and hit it from C3, missing into C4. Again, however, you should
          evaluate your own likelihood of playing a break to 4-back with only 3
          balls on the lawn if you hit, and so you may want to consider lagging
          to the ball, a couple of yards in-lawn from the east boundary.
        

          If the ball on the east boundary is south of the peg, it is tempting
          to simply shoot at it from A baulk. Missing will of course leave a
          double from B baulk, but the odds of yellow then hitting a double
          target from 20+ yards is no certainty. Alternatively, if the
          second-turn ball is around peg-high, then shooting at it from B baulk
          from a few yards west of C3 and missing often results in a fairly even
          spread of the balls, with your black ball being approximately 8 yards
          south of red and 8 yards north of C4. This again is technically a
          double target from somewhere on B Baulk, but given the distance
          between red and black, is easily missed and will leave your black ball
          a shot of only 8 yards.

Response to C4 ball after EB opening

          This opening creates one of the more interesting third-turn decisions.
          A second-turn ball 6" north of C4 is a very threatening position and
          therefore the options will as follows:
        


            Shoot at partner
            
Hit - set a dream leave

                Miss - leaves yellow a 13-yard shot at red in C4 for a 4-ball
                break
              



            Shoot at opponent near C4 from A baulk
            

                Hit - set a dream leave (you may want to have a go at gaining a
                rush to H1 on partner)
              

                Miss - leave a 13-yard double for yellow (but slightly tricky
                break pick-up)
              



            Join up with opponent near C4, leaving no double
            

                If red is 3-6" north of C4 - join a yard north of it from A
                baulk
                
No short double target is left for yellow

                    Yellow still only has a 13-yard shot for the innings (but a
                    slightly tricky break pick-up)
                  



                If red is ~12" north of C4 - shoot from C3 through to C4
                

                    Enables black to have a shot (albeit very long) to attempt
                    to hit and set a dream leave
                  




Black to C2


              By burying itself in C2, this enables black to kill off the
              aggression by red and yellow. Any miss by yellow will leave a 9
              yarder (at most) for blue
            






              Some common third-ball responses to a C4 ball
            



          A personal preference of mine is to shoot third-turn at the ball near
          C4 from A baulk, because hitting gives me control of the court, and I
          miss often enough by more than several inches so as not to leave a
          double.
        

          Be on the lookout for cannons around C4 as part of this opening -
          there is often a good opportunity to bombard a live ball across to H1
          while playing a croquet stroke towards blue on the east boundary. This
          can make picking up the first break a great deal easier.
        
Response to duffer tice after EB opening

          The duffer tice is one of my favourite openings. Because of the
          placement of red near H6, a miss by black from the end of B baulk will
          be headed towards A baulk and give an easy start for yellow. That is
          why we see the ~9 yard shot at red refused so often, even by very
          strong players!
        

          If black does decide to shoot at the duffer and hits, then not a great
          deal of options are available other than to take off to partner ball
          (usually nudging red towards the peg in the process), and leave a rush
          towards red, and then hope for a fourth-turn miss by yellow.
        

          Another option for shooting at the duffer is doing so from C3,
          shooting across the court and missing to around peg-high (or just
          south of peg-high) on the west boundary. This is the most defensive
          shot available in that a miss gives no break to yellow if yellow hits
          red, but it also does not put any pressure on yellow's shot at red.
          Often times, when black misses the shot from C3 at red, it will end up
          south of peg-high on the west boundary and be a tempting free shot for
          yellow from C1.
        

          Shooting at partner ball on turn 3 is the most aggressive line of play
          - taking the shot from A baulk and hitting gives the opportunity to
          play a big croquet stroke loading partner to H2 and attempting to get
          a rush to H1 on the duffer ball - it is a big shot and the break
          chances are normally only reasonable for very strong players. Missing
          partner from A baulk on the other hand gives yellow a ~9 yard shot and
          very strong break prospects. It is therefore more usual to see black
          shoot at blue from C3 which, although longer, doesn't make all the
          balls available to yellow if black misses blue and yellow hits red. It
          also means that blue and black maintain a wide join and have realistic
          prospects of hitting back in if yellow misses red.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a duffer tice
            


Response to 2 balls on EB

          If red has shot at blue on turn 2 and missed, leaving both balls on
          the east boundary, you should carefully evaluate your response based
          on the strength of your opponent. If you and your opponent are evenly
          matched but not world class players, or especially if your opponent is
          a much stronger player than you, then the best thing to do here may be
          to simply ignore the two balls on the east boundary and lag black into
          the middle of the court and wait for yellow to miss. This potentially
          presents you with an immediate break with a ball in the middle of the
          court.
        

          In a match between two very strong players it would be unusual to see
          no shot taken on turn 3, and if hit, some attempt at digging out a
          3-ball break.
        
Response to 2 balls in-court

          In a situation where you have laid a supershot with blue, and red has
          lagged a couple of yards north east of your supershot ball, if there
          is no double target to be had from anywhere on the baulk lines, you
          must again consider your expectations after hitting third turn vs your
          opponent's likelihood of hitting fourth turn. As with previous
          options, if you are playing an opponent who on paper is a much
          stronger player, the percentage play is usually to lag the black ball
          into the middle of the court beside the other two balls (being mindful
          not to leave a double target from anywhere), which will put pressure
          on your stronger opponent to hit in or else concede the first break
          opportunity to you.
        

          If you do want to shoot with black at one of the balls in the middle,
          then consider either shooting at the easterly ball from C1 (you may
          even be able to shoot hard at this without missing to B baulk), or
          alternatively shooting at a medium pace at either blue or red from the
          closest point on A baulk. If you do shoot from the closest point, be
          sure to hit at a pace to finish slightly south of H6, both so that
          black is not a short shot from B baulk, and so that any double target
          that you leave has plenty of space between the front and back ball.
        

          If you are facing a third turn shot with black after red has
          cross-wired blue and red at the peg, check first to see if there is a
          point which you can lag to where blue won't be wired from black, and
          which won't be giving a double target from either baulk line - if
          there is such a spot, then that is the best place to lag to.

 Fourth Ball Options
      

The fourth-turn response is usually actually more simple than then third-turn response - although there are more possible scenarios, they almost always result in yellow trying to roquet something.  
      

Response to ignored WB tice
When black has ignored a standard west boundary tice and insetad shot at (and missed) partner on the east boundary, the obvious response is to then try and hit red yourself from C1.  If the placement of red is good, you should have ~50% chance of hitting in.  Your break prospects after hitting red are actually quite good, as you will play a take off from red to blue & black, which will automatically be sending red towards H2 as a pioneer.  On the other hand, a miss with yellow through red into C2 only gives fairly mediocre break prospects to blue & black in the next turn.
Response to missed WB tice
If black did indeed shoot at red (and miss) from C1 in the previous turn, then the obvious response is to shoot at red yourself, but from a point east of C1 so that a miss will leave yellow joined with red.  If you hit red, your best line of play would be to roll red &  yellow towards C1 and lay a rush for your next turn.  A miss from red at yellow will of course leave black a shot through red and yellow from C2 to C1 but is likely to be a very long shot at a single ball target.  A miss from black on turn 5 here also gives you a good chance at establishing a break on turn 5.  




              If black has missed the standard tice, it leaves a good opportunity to join up with red on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C2 ball after EB opening
Having played red into C2 on turn 2, if black ignores red and simply joins with blue (which is likely), then against most players your best line of play would be to shoot at blue and black with red.  Whether you shoot from A baulk or B baulk depends on factors such as the distance between blue and black (whether it is easy to make a double target from B baulk or A baulk) and the flatness of the east boundary.  If the black ball missed blue badly on the left on turn 3, blue and black may well be 2+ yards apart on the east boundary, so there is a defensive option available to yellow as well - shoot from C3 through to C4, where a miss would not give blue & black any easy opening.
If you are the weaker player against a very strong opponent, then there is a case for shooting yellow at red - at 13 yards, it is significantly shorter than any other available shot and is therefore your best chance at winning the opening.  Red missing yellow gives blue a relatively easy start and a probable break, but against a very strong opponent it can still be worth the risk.  




              Fourth-turn responses for yellow when partner is in C2 and opponent balls are on the east boundary.  
            


Response to joined / missed C2 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, if black has for some reason shot at red in C2, then assuming a double target has been left, your best aggressive option is to shoot at this, preferably hitting the northern ball, from B baulk.  A hit or a miss here will give fairly good break prospects to whomever plays the next shot, given C2's proximity to H2 - a semi-good pioneer can usually be sent to H2 while obtaining a rush to H1.
If black has instead joined up a yard south of red on turn 2, you have no double target (except from C1, but let's not consider that).  Now you have fundamentally two options - either shoot yellow at red which will give a good break opportunity if hit (and concede a good break opportunity to black if missed), or take a more defensive line by shooting yellow at blue from C3 into C4.  If yellow misses this shot, it does give black a 1-yard roquet at red for the innings, however it not only gives no break prospects, but also requires black to play several good strokes in order to have a good leave.  Black's take off from C2 to blue on the east boundary is a difficult shot, and if black doesn't succeed in roqueting blue in its next shot (either taking off short and missing blue, or taking off too far and sending black out) then yellow will have a 9-10 yard shot at blue & black from near C4.




              If black has joined a yard south of red near C2, the yellow has aggressive and defensive options available
            


Response to missed EB ball after Supershot opening
The response here depends a lot on both the length of the supershot ball and what option black chose on turn 3.  Firstly let's assume the most common scenario, with blue halfway between H5 and peg, and 1-2 yards west of the centre line, and red approximately peg high on the EB, and black in or near C4.  In this situation the best option is normally to shoot at red from A baulk, with a miss joining up around 1 yard north of it.  This leaves blue a 15-yarder at red & yellow but difficult break prospects for both players, whomever plays the next shot. 




              The common response after a third-turn miss by black at red to C4, is for yellow to shoot at red, joining if missing.  An aggressive line is to shoot at black.  A third option is yellow at blue, which is shorter and will win you the innings, but only gives good break prospects if red and black are near to each other
            


As the weaker player against a stronger player, a very aggressive line of play would be to shoot yellow from A baulk at black in C4 - this is very black and white, as a hit will give you a good chance for a 4-ball break and a miss will give black the same chance.  As the weaker player, you can strongly consider this option.  
Consider for a moment that black's third-turn shot missed red from A baulk, or perhaps missed red from west of C3, finishing 5-10 yards south of red.  In this case, yellow for look for possible double targets available from B baulk.  Consider, too, the shortest shot available, which is yellow at blue from A baulk - this is likely a 11-13 yard shot which, if hit, gives good break prospects to yellow because red and black are close together.
Response to ignored duffer tice
The vast majority of the time the best response to black ignoring red's duffer tice, is for yellow to shoot hard at red from B baulk.  Usually a duffer tice is only 9-10 yards and so it will be, by far, the shortest shot for yellow.




              The majority of the time, the fourth turn response would be to shoot yellow at the duffer.  Against a very strong player, you might be tempted by yellow at black in C4 which, although 3 yards longer, gives an easy start to your break
            


An expection to this would be if blue & black are joined on the east boundary leaving a good double target from A baulk, and so you may want to consider shooting at that instead.  Another option to consider is if black shot and missed blue from C3 to C4.  If you are playing against a much stronger opponent you may consider shooting yellow at black from A baulk into C4.  This shot is 3 yards longer than yellow at red from B baulk, but hitting this shot gives you vastly stronger break prospects than if you hit red first.
Response to missed duffer tice
If black misses the duffer tice (red) gently, the logical response is to shoot hard at either red from B baulk or black from A baulk (whichever is closer).  If black misses the duffer tice from C3 across to the west boundary, you may consider shooting at black from C1 through to C2, particularly if black is south of peg-high.  




              If the duffer tice is still in its original position at the start of turn 4, the general response is for yellow to shoot at red given its proximity to B baulk.  If black missed red from C3 however, it can be tempting to shoot at black from C1 on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C4 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, red a few inches north of C4 and black 1 yard north of blue, yellow's default response should be to shoot at red from A baulk.  Hitting this shot gives a great break opportunity, as it is a very natural stroke to croquet red to H2 while approaching blue & black up the east boundary.  
Response to 3 balls on EB
In this instance, you simply need to hit one of the balls on the east boundary - from either A baulk or B baulk, depending on length and available targets.
Response to 3 balls in-court
A supershot opening with lags by red and black essentially forces yellow to shoot at the closest ball.  A very black and white opening, good break prospects for both players on turn 4 or 5, depending on whether yellow hits or misses.  Often times, black will have take a gentle lag while attempting a roquet at either blue or red on turn 3, so this may also give yellow some target to shoot at on turn 4.

Conclusion
If you have gotten to the bottom of this article, you have probably realised by now that the number of opening options are vast.  This article could not hope to cover every eventuality, and nor does it present any new or unseen openings; rather it serves to talk through the options and thought processes for choosing a particular option, and I hope it has been useful.

Openings

        The opening is the battle between the two sides to be the first to gain
        the upper hand. Generally when we talk about openings in croquet, we are
        referring to the first 4 turns. At the very top level it is where games
        are won and lost, but at all levels it provides a fascinating array of
        options for bluffing and double-bluffing your opponent.
      
Opening priorities
As the stronger player

        The stronger player who is playing a dangerous but less experienced /
        weaker player will generally approach the opening with the intent of not
        giving away an easy break, and hence a more defensive mindset. Openings
        where there is a lot of grey area, balls on boundaries and in corners
        are best for this. The stronger player will generally rely on their
        better all-round game in order to win, and is more comfortable with
        digging balls out slowly into a break.
      
As the weaker player

        The weaker player should approach a game against a much stronger
        opponent with an attacking mindset - they will not be afraid to take on
        relatively short shots that give laid breaks, even if it means conceding
        a laid break if they miss. The weaker player should favour openings that
        have balls in-lawn and should be looking to put pressure on the stronger
        player to have to hit in.
      
Evenly-matched players

        It is quite common to see very aggressive, black and white, openings
        when two very strong players play against each other. The same is true
        for openings between evenly-matched players at lower levels, but
        generally to a lesser extent. A lot of the opening strategy depends on
        the individual mindset of the player, with some players naturally
        playing a more attacking game than others.
      

        Below are articles on various well-known (and some not-so-well-known)
        openings, which discuss options for placement of balls, and responses to
        them. For the purposes of simplicity, in the examples below, the balls
        will always be played in the following order:
      


 Blue
        

 Red
        


          Black
        


          Yellow
        


Note: there is no ball order or sequence in which the balls need to
          be added to the game in croquet - the above order is simply to keep
          things consistent for the diagrams and explanations.


        As you can probably imagine, the options in the opening are endless.
        This article attempts to talk through some of the most common options,
        and some of the most common responses to them, with the idea of
        clarifying some of the thought processes behind them.
      

The Dream Leave

        Many of the openings below will reference something known as the Dream
        Leave - this is a scenario where the third turn ball (black) has hit and
        arranged the court as follows:
      




            Black hit on turn 3 and set a dream leave
          



        Black has retrieved red from wherever it was on the court and placed it
        slightly in-lawn from the west boundary, north of peg-high, and left
        blue a rush to it from the east boundary. This leave gives no short shot
        for yellow, and any miss by yellow will give blue a good break
        opportunity.

 First
        Ball Options
      

East Boundary

          The most common option selected by the first ball player. A ball to
          the east boundary, somewhere between level with H4 and H5, is chosen
          due to its relative distance from both baulk lines and from H1. It is
          a completely non-threatening ball and allows the second ball player to
          dictate the nature of the game, be it defensive or aggressive.
        
In-lawn East Boundary ball

          A variation on the standard east boundary ball, the in-lawn east
          boundary ball is struck out in the same area as the standard east
          boundary ball, but purposefully left about 1 yard in from the yardline
          area. The idea behind that is so that black can play its third turn
          shot out behind blue and leave itself a rush in-court. This play
          discourages responses like a west boundary tice from red.
        
Supershot

          A supershot ball is a first-turn ball placed near the middle of the
          court, normally between H5 and peg and a couple of yards west of the
          centre line. This is the most aggressive sensible option for the first
          ball, and signals your intent to your opponent that you want no grey
          area. Given its proximity to H1, a supershot ball generally gives a
          good chance for a break for either player, depending on whether the
          third-turn, fourth-turn or fifth-turn shots are hit.
        

          There are variations on the length of the supershot, with a supershot
          played to near the peg being a poorer pioneer for H1 but having the
          advantage of lengthening any fourth-turn shot by yellow at it.
        
Anti-duffer

          This opening is an attempt to try and pre-empt the second-turn
          response and discourage a "duffer tice" by red. To lay an anti-duffer,
          you hit blue to a spot somewhere between H6 and the peg, and 1-2 yards
          west of the east boundary. The idea of placing a ball here is that if
          the opponent were to lay a duffer tice with red,
          then it gives black a good chance to hit red and take off behind blue
          for a rush to H1 on turn 3. It is a leave that is generally only used
          by strong players who have a realistic chance of a third-turn break in
          the first place.
        




              Some common first-ball scenarios
            


Unusual first-turn options

          The croquet court is a big place and so there really are endless
          options for where to place balls in the opening. Often an unusual
          option first-turn will yield good results by confusing the opponent!
        
C4 first ball

          Not often seen these days due to a preference for an east boundary
          ball 10 yards further north. A weakness of this opening is that
          shooting at partner on turn 3 and missing is liable to leave a double
          target for yellow. It also generally encourages yellow to take an
          aggressive shot on turn 4; however on a difficult lawn this opening
          can have some advantages, with any hit by yellow on turn 4 at balls in
          C4 leaving little room to promote balls into the court due to the
          close proximity to the corner.
        
C2 first ball

          Playing blue into C2 first turn can often catch the opponent off
          guard. This opening attempts to flip the tables on red and yellow by
          trying to ensure a defensive opening for blue and black. This can be a
          good option where blue and black are the stronger players and want to
          prevent aggressive second-turn options by red and yellow. Of course,
          there are options available to red and yellow which negate blue and
          black's defensive preferences.
        
Micro tice

          As unusual options go, this is right up there. This option would not
          be recommended when playing a strong player, but nevertheless is very
          interesting. The micro tice is a ball played from the end of A baulk
          towards the east boundary, but only 2-3 yards towards it, leaving a
          2-3 yard roquet for the opponent on the second turn. This length of
          shot cannot really be refused, but leaving red a croquet stroke from
          south-west of hoop 4 on the second turn of the game gives no real
          break prospects. Often the second turn player will attempt an approach
          to H1 and fail it, leaving a 6-yard roquet with two balls near H1 for
          black. This opening relies more on a tactical mistake from red than
          anything else
        
C1 / C3 opening

          Occasionally seen. Not a good opening against any experienced
          opponent, but occasionally yields results. This first-turn option is
          not to be recommended. A first-turn ball in C1 followed by a
          second-turn response to C3 (or vice versa) is a killer blow to black's
          turn.
        
Back to top




 Second
        Ball Options
      


          This is where things start to get a little interesting. For the most
          part, the opening is dictated by the second ball response, and there
          are many more options available.
        
Response to East Boundary ball
Standard Tice

          The standard tice is one of the most popular responses to an east
          boundary ball at club-level croquet. Although in recent years it has
          fallen out of favour with top players (likely due to an increase in
          the standard of shooting), it is still a great opening that gives good
          chances to both sides.
        

          The standard tice is where red is played to the west boundary, and the
          distance it is placed north of C1 needs to be carefully considered by
          the striker or red. The name "tice" indicates that the distance should
          be enticing for the player of black to shoot at and so a distance of
          between about 8 and 13 yards is common. As a general rule, if possible
          the distance chosen should either be about 1 yard longer than the
          opponent's critical distance (the distance at which someone hits 50%
          of their shots) or 1 yard shorter (or equal to) your own critical
          distance. Obviously this cannot be achieved if your opponent has a
          longer critical distance than you do, so it is better to err slightly
          on the longer side.
        

          If blue is an in-lawn east boundary ball, laying a standard tice is
          risky, as black can quite easily lay a rush directly to it on the
          third turn.
        
C2 ball

          Probably the most common response to the east boundary ball today is
          the second-turn ball to 6" south of C2. The reason for playing just
          south of C2 is that if in the unlikely event of black shooting at red
          on turn 3, a miss will likely leave yellow a double target. The idea
          of red near C2 means that red is buried in a defensive position, and
          signals yellow's intent to shoot at blue and black on turn 4.
        

          If blue is slightly in-lawn, then C2 is the safest and most defensive
          response with red.
        
Duffer tice

          One of the more aggressive responses for red is the duffer tice. This
          is a ball that is placed usually about 2-feet north and a few inches
          east of penultimate. This is similarly enticing for the opponent to
          shoot (just as with a standard tice) but in this case a miss is
          usually more critical - any third turn shot at the duffer is in the
          direction of A baulk so black usually takes the shot gently - and by
          doing so is more likely to miss. Black missing leaves two balls in the
          centre of the court, giving yellow a great chance on turn 4. The
          duffer tice is a great option for weaker players playing against
          stronger players, and also for anyone confident in hitting 10 yarders.
        

          Between two very strong players a duffer tice is still a popular
          opening. There are variations on the placement of the ball near
          penult, based on the strength of the opponent. It is common to see a
          duffer tice placed level with, or south of, H6, particularly if the
          striker of red and yellow is a very good shot and is confident to hit
          an 11-yarder on turn 4. In a game between experts, the placement of
          red is sometimes moved to the west of H6 to discourage a third-turn
          break after a hit from black at blue.
        
C4 ball

          This option is very popular in New Zealand and although a mirror image
          of the C2 ball, is a lot more aggressive. Placing red 6" north of C4
          not only gives negligible break prospects to black on turn 3 but also
          signals your intent to hit fourth-turn with yellow and have a break. A
          miss at partner by black on turn 3 gives you a 13-yard shot for a
          4-ball break, and a miss by black at red on turn 3 usually gives a
          double target.
        
Shoot at first-turn ball

          A slightly counter-intuitive option but nonetheless an interesting
          one. Shooting red at blue on turn 2 and hitting gives no break
          prospects, but a miss also leaves very slim break prospects for black
          on turn 3 if it hits, unless black is a very strong player. With this
          opening it is quite common to see misses on both turns 2 and 3, and
          often a triple target for yellow at the other 3 balls on turn 4 from B
          baulk.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to east boundary opening
            


Response to Supershot ball

          The supershot ball is the most aggressive opening that the first-turn
          player can use. There are several responses to this which need to be
          considered, based on your assessment of your opponent's ability and
          whether the opponent has realistic prospects of a break to 4-back if
          they do manage to hit 3rd turn.
        
C2 response

          The C2 response is a ball played about 6" south of C2. This is a
          strong response to a supershot against almost all players. If the
          player of black wants to attempt a third-turn break, they will have to
          hit a 13-yarder and play a very difficult croquet stroke out of C2 to
          get a rush to H1, and this is by no means guaranteed. On the other
          hand, a miss by black at red on turn 3 will leave yellow a double
          target and a 4-ball break if hit.
        




              It is important to finish a few inches south of C2 with red as it
              will mean black missing on either side of it will leave a double
              target. Above is a comparison of yellow's target after a
              third-turn miss by black at red, firstly with red in C2 and
              secondly with red a few inches south of C2
            



          There are only a handful of players in the world where the C2 ball is
          not a great response - players who would expect to hit the 13 yarder
          most of the time and also be good enough at croquet strokes to expect
          to get a rush to H1 on the supershot ball. Against these players the
          strategy of lengthing the 3rd turn shot would be preferred.
        
C4 response

          Mirror image to the C2 response, this ball is played 6" north of C4.
          Consider this if blue (the supershot ball) is placed further north
          than normal (somewhere near peg-high), or is in a particular spot
          which may have H4 obscuring any croquet stroke from C4 towards it. It
          otherwise gives all the same advantages as the C2 response
        
Max Distance response

          As a counter to the very top players hitting the ball in C2 most of
          the time, the max distance response became popular - this is where red
          is played to the east boundary about level with the peg on the east
          boundary, leaving the longest shot possible for black. This response
          grants black a shot from C3 through red and into C4, reducing yellow's
          fourth-turn prospects - it relies more on black missing red than
          trying to make any break pick-up by black more difficult. Generally a
          good option against the very best players, but against most players is
          unnecessary.  
The reason why max distance on the east boundary is chosen instead of the equivalent max distance spot on the west boundary is that it is slightly further from the supershot ball (blue), which is slightly south-west of the peg.  Assuming that the shots on turns 3 and 4 are missed, blue's shot at red & yellow on the east boundary will be a couple of yards longer than the equivalent shot to the west boundary.  
Supershot lag

          The response for red to lag to a spot 3-4 yards east and 1-2 yards
          north of the supershot ball is a very strong and very under-used
          response to the supershot. This is a good tactic when playing someone
          who is a very good shot, and in particular if the supershot ball
          itself is quite deep (nearer the peg than H5). Placing red beside blue
          nullifies the strength of black's shooting by encouraging black to
          take its third turn shot gently (which is generally less accurate), or
          risk shooting hard and missing into B baulk, conceding a 4-ball break.
          In this case, black may choose not to shoot at all, and instead also
          lag to a position wide of the other two balls, meaning that red and
          yellow have successfully turned the tables of the supershot opening
          and enabled yellow to have the first attempted roquet.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to supershot opening
            


Roquet the Supershot ball

          The ultimate way to nullify the supershot ball - roquet it on the
          second turn. After roqueting blue with red, there are several options
          available. You can croquet blue towards C2 and then fire red off 6"
          north of C4. A more aggressive option would be to croquet blue
          north-west of H2 and fire red off the south boundary, south of H4 -
          this leaves black a choice of 7-8 yarders but minimal break prospects
          and difficult strokes with their third turn in order to distance the
          balls from baulk. A more novel option would be to crosswire blue and
          red at the peg, which leaves only a 17-yard shot for black with a
          baulk line in the background. An even more interesting option might be
          to roll blue close to the peg, either east or west, and then play red
          a yard or two away from it, wiring blue's backswing at red. This means
          that black probably has no lag option towards blue that doesn't leave
          a double-target for yellow.
        
Response to unusual first-turn options
Response to a first-turn C2 ball

          A first-turn C2 ball is an attempt by blue to make red conform to a
          defensive opening. Red could of course do this if it wants, by playing
          6" north of C4, or even by just having a "standard" east boundary
          ball; however a better option to negate blue's attempt at dictating
          the opening might be to set a duffer tice - this is the ultimate
          aggressive response to the C2 ball, and means that black is suddenly
          faced with having to hit a 10-13 yarder on turn 3 or risk leaving the
          same for yellow next turn, and a laid break.
        
Back to top



 Third
        Ball Options
      

        For the vast majority of players, if they manage to hit in on the third
        turn of the game, they will and should be looking to make a dream leave
        (see top of page) or similar, possibly with red near the peg and blue &
        black with a rush towards it. There are exceptions to this line of play,
        mainly with supershot openings, but unless otherwise stated, the
        standard play would be to try and set a dream leave.
      

Response to WB tice after EB opening

          Realistically, black will not be attempting to make any break on turn
          3 if it manages to hit in. The player of black has to make a judgement
          call on their likelihood of hitting the standard tice vs their
          opponent's likelihood of missing it.
        


            If the tice is long, the best response is probably to shoot black at
            blue from A baulk. Missing black at blue leaves the free shot at the
            tice for yellow of course, which does give yellow fairly good
            prospects if hit. If the tice is extremely long, say peg-high, then
            black could quite feasibly just lag at blue and attempt to leave a
            rush to red. Bear in mind that playing this lag so early in the game
            may be difficult as you may not have the pace of the court - and
            there is a risk that lagging at blue and falling short will leave
            yellow a double target on turn 4.
          

            Another option if black is uncertain, would be to shoot at blue from
            C3, and missing through to C4. This hedges black's bets somewhat, as
            it is still taking a shot at a ball and still somewhat joining with
            partner ball, but does not give good break prospects to the opponent
            if yellow hits, due to the proximity of blue and black to one
            another. Yellow is faced with a long takeoff from red towards blue
            and black and in all likelihood will not get a rush to H1 from this
            position.
          

            The third option is of course to shoot at the tice itself. Hitting
            red will give the opportunity to make a dream leave (as shown at the
            top of the page). Missing red will send black towards C2, which will
            give black a free shot back through red and yellow if yellow misses
            its fourth-turn shot at red.
          





              Some common third-ball responses to a standard tice
            


Response to C2 ball after EB opening

          There are two common options after a second-turn C2 ball - both
          consist of shooting at partner. If partner is hit, then usually the
          play will be to take off to the red in C2, roquet it and then croquet
          it either into the centre of the court, or along the west boundary,
          then lag back to partner and leave a rush in-court. However, consider
          a game where you are the stronger player playing a very capable weaker
          player, if you do hit partner third turn, you can elect to just set a
          rush to the C2 ball instead of trying to retrieve it from C2. As the
          stronger player you may prefer this line of play, instead of digging
          out the C2 ball only for your opponent to hit on turn 4 and have an
          easy break.
        

          Usually the third-turn shot at partner with black will be from A
          baulk, joining up on the east boundary if missed. This leaves a long
          double target for yellow from the end of B baulk. A more defensive
          play would be to shoot at partner from C3 into C4. Doing this leaves
          almost no break prospects fourth-turn for yellow but, depending on the
          distance between blue and black, may give them the opportunity to join
          up.
        

          Another option for black on turn 3 would be to shoot at red in C2 -
          however usually this is only a viable option if red is exactly in the
          corner, as it will mean that missing red on the right leaves no double
          target for yellow. Alternatively, another option would be for black to
          join up with red near C2, about 3-4 feet south of it. Doing so leaves
          no double target from B baulk and gives good break prospects to black
          if yellow misses the 13 yarder, although it must be remembered that
          yellow also has good prospects if it hits the 13 yarder. Black joining
          up with red also leaves a defensive shot for yellow at blue from C3 to
          C4 which, if missed, leaves black a very long and tricky takeoff from
          C2 to the east boundary.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a C2 ball
            


Response to C2 / C4 ball after Supershot opening

          The third-turn response to this option depends greatly on your ability
          and also the ability of your opponent. Before you lay the supershot,
          you need to ask yourself "am I realistically good enough to play a
          third-turn break to 4-back?". If the answer is no, then that does not
          mean that the supershot opening is a bad idea at all, but it just
          means that you may want to reassess your third-turn response.
          Additionally, if you are playing someone that you believe is much
          better than you are, then trying to give yourself a 4-ball break on
          turn 5 is exactly what you should be trying to achieve. Therefore,
          instead of trying to roquet the 13 yard shot of black at red just
          south of C2 (or just north of C4), you can instead look to join up
          with the ball 3-4 feet away, ensuring to leave no double target. This
          puts a great deal of pressure on your stronger opponent to then hit a
          13 yarder or else concede a 4-ball break to you.
        

          If you believe you are good enough to hit on turn 3 and play a break,
          then the answer is simple - hit red near C2 and go round.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / C2 ball
            


Response to EB ball after Supershot opening

          In most cases, the third-turn response to a max distance ball is to
          try and hit it from C3, missing into C4. Again, however, you should
          evaluate your own likelihood of playing a break to 4-back with only 3
          balls on the lawn if you hit, and so you may want to consider lagging
          to the ball, a couple of yards in-lawn from the east boundary.
        

          If the ball on the east boundary is south of the peg, it is tempting
          to simply shoot at it from A baulk. Missing will of course leave a
          double from B baulk, but the odds of yellow then hitting a double
          target from 20+ yards is no certainty. Alternatively, if the
          second-turn ball is around peg-high, then shooting at it from B baulk
          from a few yards west of C3 and missing often results in a fairly even
          spread of the balls, with your black ball being approximately 8 yards
          south of red and 8 yards north of C4. This again is technically a
          double target from somewhere on B Baulk, but given the distance
          between red and black, is easily missed and will leave your black ball

Response to C4 ball after EB opening

          This opening creates one of the more interesting third-turn decisions.
          A second-turn ball 6" north of C4 is a very threatening position and
          therefore the options will as follows:
        


            Shoot at partner
            
Hit - set a dream leave

                Miss - leaves yellow a 13-yard shot at red in C4 for a 4-ball
                break
              



            Shoot at opponent near C4 from A baulk
            

                Hit - set a dream leave (you may want to have a go at gaining a
                rush to H1 on partner)
              

                Miss - leave a 13-yard double for yellow (but slightly tricky
                break pick-up)
              



            Join up with opponent near C4, leaving no double
            

                If red is 3-6" north of C4 - join a yard north of it from A
                baulk
                
No short double target is left for yellow

                    Yellow still only has a 13-yard shot for the innings (but a
                    slightly tricky break pick-up)
                  



                If red is ~12" north of C4 - shoot from C3 through to C4
                

                    Enables black to have a shot (albeit very long) to attempt
                    to hit and set a dream leave
                  




Black to C2


              By burying itself in C2, this enables black to kill off the
              aggression by red and yellow. Any miss by yellow will leave a 9
              yarder (at most) for blue
            






              Some common third-ball responses to a C4 ball
            



          A personal preference of mine is to shoot third-turn at the ball near
          C4 from A baulk, because hitting gives me control of the court, and I
          miss often enough by more than several inches so as not to leave a
          double.
        

          Be on the lookout for cannons around C4 as part of this opening -
          there is often a good opportunity to bombard a live ball across to H1
          while playing a croquet stroke towards blue on the east boundary. This
          can make picking up the first break a great deal easier.
        
Response to duffer tice after EB opening

          The duffer tice is one of my favourite openings. Because of the
          placement of red near H6, a miss by black from the end of B baulk will
          be headed towards A baulk and give an easy start for yellow. That is
          why we see the ~9 yard shot at red refused so often, even by very
          strong players!
        

          If black does decide to shoot at the duffer and hits, then not a great
          deal of options are available other than to take off to partner ball
          (usually nudging red towards the peg in the process), and leave a rush
          towards red, and then hope for a fourth-turn miss by yellow.
        

          Another option for shooting at the duffer is doing so from C3,
          shooting across the court and missing to around peg-high (or just
          south of peg-high) on the west boundary. This is the most defensive
          shot available in that a miss gives no break to yellow if yellow hits
          red, but it also does not put any pressure on yellow's shot at red.
          Often times, when black misses the shot from C3 at red, it will end up
          south of peg-high on the west boundary and be a tempting free shot for
          yellow from C1.
        

          Shooting at partner ball on turn 3 is the most aggressive line of play
          - taking the shot from A baulk and hitting gives the opportunity to
          play a big croquet stroke loading partner to H2 and attempting to get
          a rush to H1 on the duffer ball - it is a big shot and the break
          chances are normally only reasonable for very strong players. Missing
          partner from A baulk on the other hand gives yellow a ~9 yard shot and
          very strong break prospects. It is therefore more usual to see black
          shoot at blue from C3 which, although longer, doesn't make all the
          balls available to yellow if black misses blue and yellow hits red. It
          also means that blue and black maintain a wide join and have realistic
          prospects of hitting back in if yellow misses red.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a duffer tice
            


Response to 2 balls on EB

          If red has shot at blue on turn 2 and missed, leaving both balls on
          the east boundary, you should carefully evaluate your response based
          on the strength of your opponent. If you and your opponent are evenly
          matched but not world class players, or especially if your opponent is
          a much stronger player than you, then the best thing to do here may be
          to simply ignore the two balls on the east boundary and lag black into
          the middle of the court and wait for yellow to miss. This potentially
          presents you with an immediate break with a ball in the middle of the
          court.
        

          In a match between two very strong players it would be unusual to see
          no shot taken on turn 3, and if hit, some attempt at digging out a
          3-ball break.
        
Response to 2 balls in-court

          In a situation where you have laid a supershot with blue, and red has
          lagged a couple of yards north east of your supershot ball, if there
          is no double target to be had from anywhere on the baulk lines, you
          must again consider your expectations after hitting third turn vs your
          opponent's likelihood of hitting fourth turn. As with previous
          options, if you are playing an opponent who on paper is a much
          stronger player, the percentage play is usually to lag the black ball
          into the middle of the court beside the other two balls (being mindful
          not to leave a double target from anywhere), which will put pressure
          on your stronger opponent to hit in or else concede the first break
          opportunity to you.
        

          If you do want to shoot with black at one of the balls in the middle,
          then consider either shooting at the easterly ball from C1 (you may
          even be able to shoot hard at this without missing to B baulk), or
          alternatively shooting at a medium pace at either blue or red from the
          closest point on A baulk. If you do shoot from the closest point, be
          sure to hit at a pace to finish slightly south of H6, both so that
          black is not a short shot from B baulk, and so that any double target
          that you leave has plenty of space between the front and back ball.
        

          If you are facing a third turn shot with black after red has
          cross-wired blue and red at the peg, check first to see if there is a
          point which you can lag to where blue won't be wired from black, and
          which won't be giving a double target from either baulk line - if
          there is such a spot, then that is the best place to lag to.

 Fourth Ball Options
      

The fourth-turn response is usually actually more simple than then third-turn response - although there are more possible scenarios, they almost always result in yellow trying to roquet something.  
      

Response to ignored WB tice
When black has ignored a standard west boundary tice and insetad shot at (and missed) partner on the east boundary, the obvious response is to then try and hit red yourself from C1.  If the placement of red is good, you should have ~50% chance of hitting in.  Your break prospects after hitting red are actually quite good, as you will play a take off from red to blue & black, which will automatically be sending red towards H2 as a pioneer.  On the other hand, a miss with yellow through red into C2 only gives fairly mediocre break prospects to blue & black in the next turn.
Response to missed WB tice
If black did indeed shoot at red (and miss) from C1 in the previous turn, then the obvious response is to shoot at red yourself, but from a point east of C1 so that a miss will leave yellow joined with red.  If you hit red, your best line of play would be to roll red &  yellow towards C1 and lay a rush for your next turn.  A miss from red at yellow will of course leave black a shot through red and yellow from C2 to C1 but is likely to be a very long shot at a single ball target.  A miss from black on turn 5 here also gives you a good chance at establishing a break on turn 5.  




              If black has missed the standard tice, it leaves a good opportunity to join up with red on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C2 ball after EB opening
Having played red into C2 on turn 2, if black ignores red and simply joins with blue (which is likely), then against most players your best line of play would be to shoot at blue and black with red.  Whether you shoot from A baulk or B baulk depends on factors such as the distance between blue and black (whether it is easy to make a double target from B baulk or A baulk) and the flatness of the east boundary.  If the black ball missed blue badly on the left on turn 3, blue and black may well be 2+ yards apart on the east boundary, so there is a defensive option available to yellow as well - shoot from C3 through to C4, where a miss would not give blue & black any easy opening.
If you are the weaker player against a very strong opponent, then there is a case for shooting yellow at red - at 13 yards, it is significantly shorter than any other available shot and is therefore your best chance at winning the opening.  Red missing yellow gives blue a relatively easy start and a probable break, but against a very strong opponent it can still be worth the risk.  




              Fourth-turn responses for yellow when partner is in C2 and opponent balls are on the east boundary.  
            


Response to joined / missed C2 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, if black has for some reason shot at red in C2, then assuming a double target has been left, your best aggressive option is to shoot at this, preferably hitting the northern ball, from B baulk.  A hit or a miss here will give fairly good break prospects to whomever plays the next shot, given C2's proximity to H2 - a semi-good pioneer can usually be sent to H2 while obtaining a rush to H1.
If black has instead joined up a yard south of red on turn 2, you have no double target (except from C1, but let's not consider that).  Now you have fundamentally two options - either shoot yellow at red which will give a good break opportunity if hit (and concede a good break opportunity to black if missed), or take a more defensive line by shooting yellow at blue from C3 into C4.  If yellow misses this shot, it does give black a 1-yard roquet at red for the innings, however it not only gives no break prospects, but also requires black to play several good strokes in order to have a good leave.  Black's take off from C2 to blue on the east boundary is a difficult shot, and if black doesn't succeed in roqueting blue in its next shot (either taking off short and missing blue, or taking off too far and sending black out) then yellow will have a 9-10 yard shot at blue & black from near C4.




              If black has joined a yard south of red near C2, the yellow has aggressive and defensive options available
            


Response to missed EB ball after Supershot opening
The response here depends a lot on both the length of the supershot ball and what option black chose on turn 3.  Firstly let's assume the most common scenario, with blue halfway between H5 and peg, and 1-2 yards west of the centre line, and red approximately peg high on the EB, and black in or near C4.  In this situation the best option is normally to shoot at red from A baulk, with a miss joining up around 1 yard north of it.  This leaves blue a 15-yarder at red & yellow but difficult break prospects for both players, whomever plays the next shot. 




              The common response after a third-turn miss by black at red to C4, is for yellow to shoot at red, joining if missing.  An aggressive line is to shoot at black.  A third option is yellow at blue, which is shorter and will win you the innings, but only gives good break prospects if red and black are near to each other
            


As the weaker player against a stronger player, a very aggressive line of play would be to shoot yellow from A baulk at black in C4 - this is very black and white, as a hit will give you a good chance for a 4-ball break and a miss will give black the same chance.  As the weaker player, you can strongly consider this option.  
Consider for a moment that black's third-turn shot missed red from A baulk, or perhaps missed red from west of C3, finishing 5-10 yards south of red.  In this case, yellow for look for possible double targets available from B baulk.  Consider, too, the shortest shot available, which is yellow at blue from A baulk - this is likely a 11-13 yard shot which, if hit, gives good break prospects to yellow because red and black are close together.
Response to ignored duffer tice
The vast majority of the time the best response to black ignoring red's duffer tice, is for yellow to shoot hard at red from B baulk.  Usually a duffer tice is only 9-10 yards and so it will be, by far, the shortest shot for yellow.




              The majority of the time, the fourth turn response would be to shoot yellow at the duffer.  Against a very strong player, you might be tempted by yellow at black in C4 which, although 3 yards longer, gives an easy start to your break
            


An expection to this would be if blue & black are joined on the east boundary leaving a good double target from A baulk, and so you may want to consider shooting at that instead.  Another option to consider is if black shot and missed blue from C3 to C4.  If you are playing against a much stronger opponent you may consider shooting yellow at black from A baulk into C4.  This shot is 3 yards longer than yellow at red from B baulk, but hitting this shot gives you vastly stronger break prospects than if you hit red first.
Response to missed duffer tice
If black misses the duffer tice (red) gently, the logical response is to shoot hard at either red from B baulk or black from A baulk (whichever is closer).  If black misses the duffer tice from C3 across to the west boundary, you may consider shooting at black from C1 through to C2, particularly if black is south of peg-high.  




              If the duffer tice is still in its original position at the start of turn 4, the general response is for yellow to shoot at red given its proximity to B baulk.  If black missed red from C3 however, it can be tempting to shoot at black from C1 on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C4 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, red a few inches north of C4 and black 1 yard north of blue, yellow's default response should be to shoot at red from A baulk.  Hitting this shot gives a great break opportunity, as it is a very natural stroke to croquet red to H2 while approaching blue & black up the east boundary.  
Response to 3 balls on EB
In this instance, you simply need to hit one of the balls on the east boundary - from either A baulk or B baulk, depending on length and available targets.
Response to 3 balls in-court
A supershot opening with lags by red and black essentially forces yellow to shoot at the closest ball.  A very black and white opening, good break prospects for both players on turn 4 or 5, depending on whether yellow hits or misses.  Often times, black will have take a gentle lag while attempting a roquet at either blue or red on turn 3, so this may also give yellow some target to shoot at on turn 4.

Conclusion
If you have gotten to the bottom of this article, you have probably realised by now that the number of opening options are vast.  This article could not hope to cover every eventuality, and nor does it present any new or unseen openings; rather it serves to talk through the options and thought processes for choosing a particular option, and I hope it has been useful.

Openings

        The opening is the battle between the two sides to be the first to gain
        the upper hand. Generally when we talk about openings in croquet, we are
        referring to the first 4 turns. At the very top level it is where games
        are won and lost, but at all levels it provides a fascinating array of
        options for bluffing and double-bluffing your opponent.
      
Opening priorities
As the stronger player

        The stronger player who is playing a dangerous but less experienced /
        weaker player will generally approach the opening with the intent of not
        giving away an easy break, and hence a more defensive mindset. Openings
        where there is a lot of grey area, balls on boundaries and in corners
        are best for this. The stronger player will generally rely on their
        better all-round game in order to win, and is more comfortable with
        digging balls out slowly into a break.
      
As the weaker player

        The weaker player should approach a game against a much stronger
        opponent with an attacking mindset - they will not be afraid to take on
        relatively short shots that give laid breaks, even if it means conceding
        a laid break if they miss. The weaker player should favour openings that
        have balls in-lawn and should be looking to put pressure on the stronger
        player to have to hit in.
      
Evenly-matched players

        It is quite common to see very aggressive, black and white, openings
        when two very strong players play against each other. The same is true
        for openings between evenly-matched players at lower levels, but
        generally to a lesser extent. A lot of the opening strategy depends on
        the individual mindset of the player, with some players naturally
        playing a more attacking game than others.
      

        Below are articles on various well-known (and some not-so-well-known)
        openings, which discuss options for placement of balls, and responses to
        them. For the purposes of simplicity, in the examples below, the balls
        will always be played in the following order:
      


 Blue
        

 Red
        


          Black
        


          Yellow
        


Note: there is no ball order or sequence in which the balls need to
          be added to the game in croquet - the above order is simply to keep
          things consistent for the diagrams and explanations.


        As you can probably imagine, the options in the opening are endless.
        This article attempts to talk through some of the most common options,
        and some of the most common responses to them, with the idea of
        clarifying some of the thought processes behind them.
      

The Dream Leave

        Many of the openings below will reference something known as the Dream
        Leave - this is a scenario where the third turn ball (black) has hit and
        arranged the court as follows:
      




            Black hit on turn 3 and set a dream leave
          



        Black has retrieved red from wherever it was on the court and placed it
        slightly in-lawn from the west boundary, north of peg-high, and left
        blue a rush to it from the east boundary. This leave gives no short shot
        for yellow, and any miss by yellow will give blue a good break
        opportunity.

 First
        Ball Options
      

East Boundary

          The most common option selected by the first ball player. A ball to
          the east boundary, somewhere between level with H4 and H5, is chosen
          due to its relative distance from both baulk lines and from H1. It is
          a completely non-threatening ball and allows the second ball player to
          dictate the nature of the game, be it defensive or aggressive.
        
In-lawn East Boundary ball

          A variation on the standard east boundary ball, the in-lawn east
          boundary ball is struck out in the same area as the standard east
          boundary ball, but purposefully left about 1 yard in from the yardline
          area. The idea behind that is so that black can play its third turn
          shot out behind blue and leave itself a rush in-court. This play
          discourages responses like a west boundary tice from red.
        
Supershot

          A supershot ball is a first-turn ball placed near the middle of the
          court, normally between H5 and peg and a couple of yards west of the
          centre line. This is the most aggressive sensible option for the first
          ball, and signals your intent to your opponent that you want no grey
          area. Given its proximity to H1, a supershot ball generally gives a
          good chance for a break for either player, depending on whether the
          third-turn, fourth-turn or fifth-turn shots are hit.
        

          There are variations on the length of the supershot, with a supershot
          played to near the peg being a poorer pioneer for H1 but having the
          advantage of lengthening any fourth-turn shot by yellow at it.
        
Anti-duffer

          This opening is an attempt to try and pre-empt the second-turn
          response and discourage a "duffer tice" by red. To lay an anti-duffer,
          you hit blue to a spot somewhere between H6 and the peg, and 1-2 yards
          west of the east boundary. The idea of placing a ball here is that if
          the opponent were to lay a duffer tice with red,
          then it gives black a good chance to hit red and take off behind blue
          for a rush to H1 on turn 3. It is a leave that is generally only used
          by strong players who have a realistic chance of a third-turn break in
          the first place.
        




              Some common first-ball scenarios
            


Unusual first-turn options

          The croquet court is a big place and so there really are endless
          options for where to place balls in the opening. Often an unusual
          option first-turn will yield good results by confusing the opponent!
        
C4 first ball

          Not often seen these days due to a preference for an east boundary
          ball 10 yards further north. A weakness of this opening is that
          shooting at partner on turn 3 and missing is liable to leave a double
          target for yellow. It also generally encourages yellow to take an
          aggressive shot on turn 4; however on a difficult lawn this opening
          can have some advantages, with any hit by yellow on turn 4 at balls in
          C4 leaving little room to promote balls into the court due to the
          close proximity to the corner.
        
C2 first ball

          Playing blue into C2 first turn can often catch the opponent off
          guard. This opening attempts to flip the tables on red and yellow by
          trying to ensure a defensive opening for blue and black. This can be a
          good option where blue and black are the stronger players and want to
          prevent aggressive second-turn options by red and yellow. Of course,
          there are options available to red and yellow which negate blue and
          black's defensive preferences.
        
Micro tice

          As unusual options go, this is right up there. This option would not
          be recommended when playing a strong player, but nevertheless is very
          interesting. The micro tice is a ball played from the end of A baulk
          towards the east boundary, but only 2-3 yards towards it, leaving a
          2-3 yard roquet for the opponent on the second turn. This length of
          shot cannot really be refused, but leaving red a croquet stroke from
          south-west of hoop 4 on the second turn of the game gives no real
          break prospects. Often the second turn player will attempt an approach
          to H1 and fail it, leaving a 6-yard roquet with two balls near H1 for
          black. This opening relies more on a tactical mistake from red than
          anything else
        
C1 / C3 opening

          Occasionally seen. Not a good opening against any experienced
          opponent, but occasionally yields results. This first-turn option is
          not to be recommended. A first-turn ball in C1 followed by a
          second-turn response to C3 (or vice versa) is a killer blow to black's
          turn.

 Second
        Ball Options
      


          This is where things start to get a little interesting. For the most
          part, the opening is dictated by the second ball response, and there
          are many more options available.
        
Response to East Boundary ball
Standard Tice

          The standard tice is one of the most popular responses to an east
          boundary ball at club-level croquet. Although in recent years it has
          fallen out of favour with top players (likely due to an increase in
          the standard of shooting), it is still a great opening that gives good
          chances to both sides.
        

          The standard tice is where red is played to the west boundary, and the
          distance it is placed north of C1 needs to be carefully considered by
          the striker or red. The name "tice" indicates that the distance should
          be enticing for the player of black to shoot at and so a distance of
          between about 8 and 13 yards is common. As a general rule, if possible
          the distance chosen should either be about 1 yard longer than the
          opponent's critical distance (the distance at which someone hits 50%
          of their shots) or 1 yard shorter (or equal to) your own critical
          distance. Obviously this cannot be achieved if your opponent has a
          longer critical distance than you do, so it is better to err slightly
          on the longer side.
        

          If blue is an in-lawn east boundary ball, laying a standard tice is
          risky, as black can quite easily lay a rush directly to it on the
          third turn.
        
C2 ball

          Probably the most common response to the east boundary ball today is
          the second-turn ball to 6" south of C2. The reason for playing just
          south of C2 is that if in the unlikely event of black shooting at red
          on turn 3, a miss will likely leave yellow a double target. The idea
          of red near C2 means that red is buried in a defensive position, and
          signals yellow's intent to shoot at blue and black on turn 4.
        

          If blue is slightly in-lawn, then C2 is the safest and most defensive
          response with red.
        
Duffer tice

          One of the more aggressive responses for red is the duffer tice. This
          is a ball that is placed usually about 2-feet north and a few inches
          east of penultimate. This is similarly enticing for the opponent to
          shoot (just as with a standard tice) but in this case a miss is
          usually more critical - any third turn shot at the duffer is in the
          direction of A baulk so black usually takes the shot gently - and by
          doing so is more likely to miss. Black missing leaves two balls in the
          centre of the court, giving yellow a great chance on turn 4. The
          duffer tice is a great option for weaker players playing against
          stronger players, and also for anyone confident in hitting 10 yarders.
        

          Between two very strong players a duffer tice is still a popular
          opening. There are variations on the placement of the ball near
          penult, based on the strength of the opponent. It is common to see a
          duffer tice placed level with, or south of, H6, particularly if the
          striker of red and yellow is a very good shot and is confident to hit
          an 11-yarder on turn 4. In a game between experts, the placement of
          red is sometimes moved to the west of H6 to discourage a third-turn
          break after a hit from black at blue.
        
C4 ball

          This option is very popular in New Zealand and although a mirror image
          of the C2 ball, is a lot more aggressive. Placing red 6" north of C4
          not only gives negligible break prospects to black on turn 3 but also
          signals your intent to hit fourth-turn with yellow and have a break. A
          miss at partner by black on turn 3 gives you a 13-yard shot for a
          4-ball break, and a miss by black at red on turn 3 usually gives a
          double target.
        
Shoot at first-turn ball

          A slightly counter-intuitive option but nonetheless an interesting
          one. Shooting red at blue on turn 2 and hitting gives no break
          prospects, but a miss also leaves very slim break prospects for black
          on turn 3 if it hits, unless black is a very strong player. With this
          opening it is quite common to see misses on both turns 2 and 3, and
          often a triple target for yellow at the other 3 balls on turn 4 from B
          baulk.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to east boundary opening
            


Response to Supershot ball

          The supershot ball is the most aggressive opening that the first-turn
          player can use. There are several responses to this which need to be
          considered, based on your assessment of your opponent's ability and
          whether the opponent has realistic prospects of a break to 4-back if
          they do manage to hit 3rd turn.
        
C2 response

          The C2 response is a ball played about 6" south of C2. This is a
          strong response to a supershot against almost all players. If the
          player of black wants to attempt a third-turn break, they will have to
          hit a 13-yarder and play a very difficult croquet stroke out of C2 to
          get a rush to H1, and this is by no means guaranteed. On the other
          hand, a miss by black at red on turn 3 will leave yellow a double
          target and a 4-ball break if hit.
        




              It is important to finish a few inches south of C2 with red as it
              will mean black missing on either side of it will leave a double
              target. Above is a comparison of yellow's target after a
              third-turn miss by black at red, firstly with red in C2 and
              secondly with red a few inches south of C2
            



          There are only a handful of players in the world where the C2 ball is
          not a great response - players who would expect to hit the 13 yarder
          most of the time and also be good enough at croquet strokes to expect
          to get a rush to H1 on the supershot ball. Against these players the
          strategy of lengthing the 3rd turn shot would be preferred.
        
C4 response

          Mirror image to the C2 response, this ball is played 6" north of C4.
          Consider this if blue (the supershot ball) is placed further north
          than normal (somewhere near peg-high), or is in a particular spot
          which may have H4 obscuring any croquet stroke from C4 towards it. It
          otherwise gives all the same advantages as the C2 response
        
Max Distance response

          As a counter to the very top players hitting the ball in C2 most of
          the time, the max distance response became popular - this is where red
          is played to the east boundary about level with the peg on the east
          boundary, leaving the longest shot possible for black. This response
          grants black a shot from C3 through red and into C4, reducing yellow's
          fourth-turn prospects - it relies more on black missing red than
          trying to make any break pick-up by black more difficult. Generally a
          good option against the very best players, but against most players is
          unnecessary.  
The reason why max distance on the east boundary is chosen instead of the equivalent max distance spot on the west boundary is that it is slightly further from the supershot ball (blue), which is slightly south-west of the peg.  Assuming that the shots on turns 3 and 4 are missed, blue's shot at red & yellow on the east boundary will be a couple of yards longer than the equivalent shot to the west boundary.  
Supershot lag

          The response for red to lag to a spot 3-4 yards east and 1-2 yards
          north of the supershot ball is a very strong and very under-used
          response to the supershot. This is a good tactic when playing someone
          who is a very good shot, and in particular if the supershot ball
          itself is quite deep (nearer the peg than H5). Placing red beside blue
          nullifies the strength of black's shooting by encouraging black to
          take its third turn shot gently (which is generally less accurate), or
          risk shooting hard and missing into B baulk, conceding a 4-ball break.
          In this case, black may choose not to shoot at all, and instead also
          lag to a position wide of the other two balls, meaning that red and
          yellow have successfully turned the tables of the supershot opening
          and enabled yellow to have the first attempted roquet.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to supershot opening
            


Roquet the Supershot ball

          The ultimate way to nullify the supershot ball - roquet it on the
          second turn. After roqueting blue with red, there are several options
          available. You can croquet blue towards C2 and then fire red off 6"
          north of C4. A more aggressive option would be to croquet blue
          north-west of H2 and fire red off the south boundary, south of H4 -
          this leaves black a choice of 7-8 yarders but minimal break prospects
          and difficult strokes with their third turn in order to distance the
          balls from baulk. A more novel option would be to crosswire blue and
          red at the peg, which leaves only a 17-yard shot for black with a
          baulk line in the background. An even more interesting option might be
          to roll blue close to the peg, either east or west, and then play red
          a yard or two away from it, wiring blue's backswing at red. This means
          that black probably has no lag option towards blue that doesn't leave
          a double-target for yellow.
        
Response to unusual first-turn options
Response to a first-turn C2 ball

          A first-turn C2 ball is an attempt by blue to make red conform to a
          defensive opening. Red could of course do this if it wants, by playing
          6" north of C4, or even by just having a "standard" east boundary
          ball; however a better option to negate blue's attempt at dictating
          the opening might be to set a duffer tice - this is the ultimate
          aggressive response to the C2 ball, and means that black is suddenly
          faced with having to hit a 10-13 yarder on turn 3 or risk leaving the
          same for yellow next turn, and a laid break.
        
Back to top



 Third
        Ball Options
      

        For the vast majority of players, if they manage to hit in on the third
        turn of the game, they will and should be looking to make a dream leave
        (see top of page) or similar, possibly with red near the peg and blue &
        black with a rush towards it. There are exceptions to this line of play,
        mainly with supershot openings, but unless otherwise stated, the
        standard play would be to try and set a dream leave.
      

Response to WB tice after EB opening

          Realistically, black will not be attempting to make any break on turn
          3 if it manages to hit in. The player of black has to make a judgement
          call on their likelihood of hitting the standard tice vs their
          opponent's likelihood of missing it.
        


            If the tice is long, the best response is probably to shoot black at
            blue from A baulk. Missing black at blue leaves the free shot at the
            tice for yellow of course, which does give yellow fairly good
            prospects if hit. If the tice is extremely long, say peg-high, then
            black could quite feasibly just lag at blue and attempt to leave a
            rush to red. Bear in mind that playing this lag so early in the game
            may be difficult as you may not have the pace of the court - and
            there is a risk that lagging at blue and falling short will leave
            yellow a double target on turn 4.
          

            Another option if black is uncertain, would be to shoot at blue from
            C3, and missing through to C4. This hedges black's bets somewhat, as
            it is still taking a shot at a ball and still somewhat joining with
            partner ball, but does not give good break prospects to the opponent
            if yellow hits, due to the proximity of blue and black to one
            another. Yellow is faced with a long takeoff from red towards blue
            and black and in all likelihood will not get a rush to H1 from this
            position.
          

            The third option is of course to shoot at the tice itself. Hitting
            red will give the opportunity to make a dream leave (as shown at the
            top of the page). Missing red will send black towards C2, which will
            give black a free shot back through red and yellow if yellow misses
            its fourth-turn shot at red.
          





              Some common third-ball responses to a standard tice
            


Response to C2 ball after EB opening

          There are two common options after a second-turn C2 ball - both
          consist of shooting at partner. If partner is hit, then usually the
          play will be to take off to the red in C2, roquet it and then croquet
          it either into the centre of the court, or along the west boundary,
          then lag back to partner and leave a rush in-court. However, consider
          a game where you are the stronger player playing a very capable weaker
          player, if you do hit partner third turn, you can elect to just set a
          rush to the C2 ball instead of trying to retrieve it from C2. As the
          stronger player you may prefer this line of play, instead of digging
          out the C2 ball only for your opponent to hit on turn 4 and have an
          easy break.
        

          Usually the third-turn shot at partner with black will be from A
          baulk, joining up on the east boundary if missed. This leaves a long
          double target for yellow from the end of B baulk. A more defensive
          play would be to shoot at partner from C3 into C4. Doing this leaves
          almost no break prospects fourth-turn for yellow but, depending on the
          distance between blue and black, may give them the opportunity to join
          up.
        

          Another option for black on turn 3 would be to shoot at red in C2 -
          however usually this is only a viable option if red is exactly in the
          corner, as it will mean that missing red on the right leaves no double
          target for yellow. Alternatively, another option would be for black to
          join up with red near C2, about 3-4 feet south of it. Doing so leaves
          no double target from B baulk and gives good break prospects to black
          if yellow misses the 13 yarder, although it must be remembered that
          yellow also has good prospects if it hits the 13 yarder. Black joining
          up with red also leaves a defensive shot for yellow at blue from C3 to
          C4 which, if missed, leaves black a very long and tricky takeoff from
          C2 to the east boundary.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a C2 ball
            


Response to C2 / C4 ball after Supershot opening

          The third-turn response to this option depends greatly on your ability
          and also the ability of your opponent. Before you lay the supershot,
          you need to ask yourself "am I realistically good enough to play a
          third-turn break to 4-back?". If the answer is no, then that does not
          mean that the supershot opening is a bad idea at all, but it just
          means that you may want to reassess your third-turn response.
          Additionally, if you are playing someone that you believe is much
          better than you are, then trying to give yourself a 4-ball break on
          turn 5 is exactly what you should be trying to achieve. Therefore,
          instead of trying to roquet the 13 yard shot of black at red just
          south of C2 (or just north of C4), you can instead look to join up
          with the ball 3-4 feet away, ensuring to leave no double target. This
          puts a great deal of pressure on your stronger opponent to then hit a
          13 yarder or else concede a 4-ball break to you.
        

          If you believe you are good enough to hit on turn 3 and play a break,
          then the answer is simple - hit red near C2 and go round.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / C2 ball
            


Response to EB ball after Supershot opening

          In most cases, the third-turn response to a max distance ball is to
          try and hit it from C3, missing into C4. Again, however, you should
          evaluate your own likelihood of playing a break to 4-back with only 3
          balls on the lawn if you hit, and so you may want to consider lagging
          to the ball, a couple of yards in-lawn from the east boundary.
        

          If the ball on the east boundary is south of the peg, it is tempting
          to simply shoot at it from A baulk. Missing will of course leave a
          double from B baulk, but the odds of yellow then hitting a double
          target from 20+ yards is no certainty. Alternatively, if the
          second-turn ball is around peg-high, then shooting at it from B baulk
          from a few yards west of C3 and missing often results in a fairly even
          spread of the balls, with your black ball being approximately 8 yards
          south of red and 8 yards north of C4. This again is technically a
          double target from somewhere on B Baulk, but given the distance
          between red and black, is easily missed and will leave your black ball
          a shot of only 8 yards.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / max distance
              ball
            


Response to C4 ball after EB opening

          This opening creates one of the more interesting third-turn decisions.
          A second-turn ball 6" north of C4 is a very threatening position and
          therefore the options will as follows:
        


            Shoot at partner
            
Hit - set a dream leave

                Miss - leaves yellow a 13-yard shot at red in C4 for a 4-ball
                break
              



            Shoot at opponent near C4 from A baulk
            

                Hit - set a dream leave (you may want to have a go at gaining a
                rush to H1 on partner)
              

                Miss - leave a 13-yard double for yellow (but slightly tricky
                break pick-up)
              



            Join up with opponent near C4, leaving no double
            

                If red is 3-6" north of C4 - join a yard north of it from A
                baulk
                
No short double target is left for yellow

                    Yellow still only has a 13-yard shot for the innings (but a
                    slightly tricky break pick-up)
                  



                If red is ~12" north of C4 - shoot from C3 through to C4
                

                    Enables black to have a shot (albeit very long) to attempt
                    to hit and set a dream leave
                  




Black to C2


              By burying itself in C2, this enables black to kill off the
              aggression by red and yellow. Any miss by yellow will leave a 9
              yarder (at most) for blue
            






              Some common third-ball responses to a C4 ball
            



          A personal preference of mine is to shoot third-turn at the ball near
          C4 from A baulk, because hitting gives me control of the court, and I
          miss often enough by more than several inches so as not to leave a
          double.
        

          Be on the lookout for cannons around C4 as part of this opening -
          there is often a good opportunity to bombard a live ball across to H1
          while playing a croquet stroke towards blue on the east boundary. This
          can make picking up the first break a great deal easier.
        
Response to duffer tice after EB opening

          The duffer tice is one of my favourite openings. Because of the
          placement of red near H6, a miss by black from the end of B baulk will
          be headed towards A baulk and give an easy start for yellow. That is
          why we see the ~9 yard shot at red refused so often, even by very
          strong players!
        

          If black does decide to shoot at the duffer and hits, then not a great
          deal of options are available other than to take off to partner ball
          (usually nudging red towards the peg in the process), and leave a rush
          towards red, and then hope for a fourth-turn miss by yellow.
        

          Another option for shooting at the duffer is doing so from C3,
          shooting across the court and missing to around peg-high (or just
          south of peg-high) on the west boundary. This is the most defensive
          shot available in that a miss gives no break to yellow if yellow hits
          red, but it also does not put any pressure on yellow's shot at red.
          Often times, when black misses the shot from C3 at red, it will end up
          south of peg-high on the west boundary and be a tempting free shot for
          yellow from C1.
        

          Shooting at partner ball on turn 3 is the most aggressive line of play
          - taking the shot from A baulk and hitting gives the opportunity to
          play a big croquet stroke loading partner to H2 and attempting to get
          a rush to H1 on the duffer ball - it is a big shot and the break
          chances are normally only reasonable for very strong players. Missing
          partner from A baulk on the other hand gives yellow a ~9 yard shot and
          very strong break prospects. It is therefore more usual to see black
          shoot at blue from C3 which, although longer, doesn't make all the
          balls available to yellow if black misses blue and yellow hits red. It
          also means that blue and black maintain a wide join and have realistic
          prospects of hitting back in if yellow misses red.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a duffer tice
            


Response to 2 balls on EB

          If red has shot at blue on turn 2 and missed, leaving both balls on
          the east boundary, you should carefully evaluate your response based
          on the strength of your opponent. If you and your opponent are evenly
          matched but not world class players, or especially if your opponent is
          a much stronger player than you, then the best thing to do here may be
          to simply ignore the two balls on the east boundary and lag black into
          the middle of the court and wait for yellow to miss. This potentially
          presents you with an immediate break with a ball in the middle of the
          court.
        

          In a match between two very strong players it would be unusual to see
          no shot taken on turn 3, and if hit, some attempt at digging out a
          3-ball break.
        
Response to 2 balls in-court

          In a situation where you have laid a supershot with blue, and red has
          lagged a couple of yards north east of your supershot ball, if there
          is no double target to be had from anywhere on the baulk lines, you
          must again consider your expectations after hitting third turn vs your
          opponent's likelihood of hitting fourth turn. As with previous
          options, if you are playing an opponent who on paper is a much
          stronger player, the percentage play is usually to lag the black ball
          into the middle of the court beside the other two balls (being mindful
          not to leave a double target from anywhere), which will put pressure
          on your stronger opponent to hit in or else concede the first break
          opportunity to you.
        

          If you do want to shoot with black at one of the balls in the middle,
          then consider either shooting at the easterly ball from C1 (you may
          even be able to shoot hard at this without missing to B baulk), or
          alternatively shooting at a medium pace at either blue or red from the
          closest point on A baulk. If you do shoot from the closest point, be
          sure to hit at a pace to finish slightly south of H6, both so that
          black is not a short shot from B baulk, and so that any double target
          that you leave has plenty of space between the front and back ball.
        

          If you are facing a third turn shot with black after red has
          cross-wired blue and red at the peg, check first to see if there is a
          point which you can lag to where blue won't be wired from black, and
          which won't be giving a double target from either baulk line - if
          there is such a spot, then that is the best place to lag to.

 Fourth Ball Options
      

The fourth-turn response is usually actually more simple than then third-turn response - although there are more possible scenarios, they almost always result in yellow trying to roquet something.  
      

Response to ignored WB tice
When black has ignored a standard west boundary tice and insetad shot at (and missed) partner on the east boundary, the obvious response is to then try and hit red yourself from C1.  If the placement of red is good, you should have ~50% chance of hitting in.  Your break prospects after hitting red are actually quite good, as you will play a take off from red to blue & black, which will automatically be sending red towards H2 as a pioneer.  On the other hand, a miss with yellow through red into C2 only gives fairly mediocre break prospects to blue & black in the next turn.
Response to missed WB tice
If black did indeed shoot at red (and miss) from C1 in the previous turn, then the obvious response is to shoot at red yourself, but from a point east of C1 so that a miss will leave yellow joined with red.  If you hit red, your best line of play would be to roll red &  yellow towards C1 and lay a rush for your next turn.  A miss from red at yellow will of course leave black a shot through red and yellow from C2 to C1 but is likely to be a very long shot at a single ball target.  A miss from black on turn 5 here also gives you a good chance at establishing a break on turn 5.  




              If black has missed the standard tice, it leaves a good opportunity to join up with red on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C2 ball after EB opening
Having played red into C2 on turn 2, if black ignores red and simply joins with blue (which is likely), then against most players your best line of play would be to shoot at blue and black with red.  Whether you shoot from A baulk or B baulk depends on factors such as the distance between blue and black (whether it is easy to make a double target from B baulk or A baulk) and the flatness of the east boundary.  If the black ball missed blue badly on the left on turn 3, blue and black may well be 2+ yards apart on the east boundary, so there is a defensive option available to yellow as well - shoot from C3 through to C4, where a miss would not give blue & black any easy opening.
If you are the weaker player against a very strong opponent, then there is a case for shooting yellow at red - at 13 yards, it is significantly shorter than any other available shot and is therefore your best chance at winning the opening.  Red missing yellow gives blue a relatively easy start and a probable break, but against a very strong opponent it can still be worth the risk.  




              Fourth-turn responses for yellow when partner is in C2 and opponent balls are on the east boundary.  
            


Response to joined / missed C2 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, if black has for some reason shot at red in C2, then assuming a double target has been left, your best aggressive option is to shoot at this, preferably hitting the northern ball, from B baulk.  A hit or a miss here will give fairly good break prospects to whomever plays the next shot, given C2's proximity to H2 - a semi-good pioneer can usually be sent to H2 while obtaining a rush to H1.
If black has instead joined up a yard south of red on turn 2, you have no double target (except from C1, but let's not consider that).  Now you have fundamentally two options - either shoot yellow at red which will give a good break opportunity if hit (and concede a good break opportunity to black if missed), or take a more defensive line by shooting yellow at blue from C3 into C4.  If yellow misses this shot, it does give black a 1-yard roquet at red for the innings, however it not only gives no break prospects, but also requires black to play several good strokes in order to have a good leave.  Black's take off from C2 to blue on the east boundary is a difficult shot, and if black doesn't succeed in roqueting blue in its next shot (either taking off short and missing blue, or taking off too far and sending black out) then yellow will have a 9-10 yard shot at blue & black from near C4.




              If black has joined a yard south of red near C2, the yellow has aggressive and defensive options available
            


Response to missed EB ball after Supershot opening
The response here depends a lot on both the length of the supershot ball and what option black chose on turn 3.  Firstly let's assume the most common scenario, with blue halfway between H5 and peg, and 1-2 yards west of the centre line, and red approximately peg high on the EB, and black in or near C4.  In this situation the best option is normally to shoot at red from A baulk, with a miss joining up around 1 yard north of it.  This leaves blue a 15-yarder at red & yellow but difficult break prospects for both players, whomever plays the next shot. 




              The common response after a third-turn miss by black at red to C4, is for yellow to shoot at red, joining if missing.  An aggressive line is to shoot at black.  A third option is yellow at blue, which is shorter and will win you the innings, but only gives good break prospects if red and black are near to each other
            


As the weaker player against a stronger player, a very aggressive line of play would be to shoot yellow from A baulk at black in C4 - this is very black and white, as a hit will give you a good chance for a 4-ball break and a miss will give black the same chance.  As the weaker player, you can strongly consider this option.  
Consider for a moment that black's third-turn shot missed red from A baulk, or perhaps missed red from west of C3, finishing 5-10 yards south of red.  In this case, yellow for look for possible double targets available from B baulk.  Consider, too, the shortest shot available, which is yellow at blue from A baulk - this is likely a 11-13 yard shot which, if hit, gives good break prospects to yellow because red and black are close together.
Response to ignored duffer tice
The vast majority of the time the best response to black ignoring red's duffer tice, is for yellow to shoot hard at red from B baulk.  Usually a duffer tice is only 9-10 yards and so it will be, by far, the shortest shot for yellow.




              The majority of the time, the fourth turn response would be to shoot yellow at the duffer.  Against a very strong player, you might be tempted by yellow at black in C4 which, although 3 yards longer, gives an easy start to your break
            


An expection to this would be if blue & black are joined on the east boundary leaving a good double target from A baulk, and so you may want to consider shooting at that instead.  Another option to consider is if black shot and missed blue from C3 to C4.  If you are playing against a much stronger opponent you may consider shooting yellow at black from A baulk into C4.  This shot is 3 yards longer than yellow at red from B baulk, but hitting this shot gives you vastly stronger break prospects than if you hit red first.
Response to missed duffer tice
If black misses the duffer tice (red) gently, the logical response is to shoot hard at either red from B baulk or black from A baulk (whichever is closer).  If black misses the duffer tice from C3 across to the west boundary, you may consider shooting at black from C1 through to C2, particularly if black is south of peg-high.  




              If the duffer tice is still in its original position at the start of turn 4, the general response is for yellow to shoot at red given its proximity to B baulk.  If black missed red from C3 however, it can be tempting to shoot at black from C1 on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C4 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, red a few inches north of C4 and black 1 yard north of blue, yellow's default response should be to shoot at red from A baulk.  Hitting this shot gives a great break opportunity, as it is a very natural stroke to croquet red to H2 while approaching blue & black up the east boundary.  
Response to 3 balls on EB
In this instance, you simply need to hit one of the balls on the east boundary - from either A baulk or B baulk, depending on length and available targets.
Response to 3 balls in-court
A supershot opening with lags by red and black essentially forces yellow to shoot at the closest ball.  A very black and white opening, good break prospects for both players on turn 4 or 5, depending on whether yellow hits or misses.  Often times, black will have take a gentle lag while attempting a roquet at either blue or red on turn 3, so this may also give yellow some target to shoot at on turn 4.

Conclusion
If you have gotten to the bottom of this article, you have probably realised by now that the number of opening options are vast.  This article could not hope to cover every eventuality, and nor does it present any new or unseen openings; rather it serves to talk through the options and thought processes for choosing a particular option, and I hope it has been useful.

Openings

        The opening is the battle between the two sides to be the first to gain
        the upper hand. Generally when we talk about openings in croquet, we are
        referring to the first 4 turns. At the very top level it is where games
        are won and lost, but at all levels it provides a fascinating array of
        options for bluffing and double-bluffing your opponent.
      
Opening priorities
As the stronger player

        The stronger player who is playing a dangerous but less experienced /
        weaker player will generally approach the opening with the intent of not
        giving away an easy break, and hence a more defensive mindset. Openings
        where there is a lot of grey area, balls on boundaries and in corners
        are best for this. The stronger player will generally rely on their
        better all-round game in order to win, and is more comfortable with
        digging balls out slowly into a break.
      
As the weaker player

        The weaker player should approach a game against a much stronger
        opponent with an attacking mindset - they will not be afraid to take on
        relatively short shots that give laid breaks, even if it means conceding
        a laid break if they miss. The weaker player should favour openings that
        have balls in-lawn and should be looking to put pressure on the stronger
        player to have to hit in.
      
Evenly-matched players

        It is quite common to see very aggressive, black and white, openings
        when two very strong players play against each other. The same is true
        for openings between evenly-matched players at lower levels, but
        generally to a lesser extent. A lot of the opening strategy depends on
        the individual mindset of the player, with some players naturally
        playing a more attacking game than others.
      

        Below are articles on various well-known (and some not-so-well-known)
        openings, which discuss options for placement of balls, and responses to
        them. For the purposes of simplicity, in the examples below, the balls
        will always be played in the following order:
      


 Blue
        

 Red
        


          Black
        


          Yellow
        


Note: there is no ball order or sequence in which the balls need to
          be added to the game in croquet - the above order is simply to keep
          things consistent for the diagrams and explanations.


        As you can probably imagine, the options in the opening are endless.
        This article attempts to talk through some of the most common options,
        and some of the most common responses to them, with the idea of
        clarifying some of the thought processes behind them.
      

The Dream Leave

        Many of the openings below will reference something known as the Dream
        Leave - this is a scenario where the third turn ball (black) has hit and
        arranged the court as follows:
      




            Black hit on turn 3 and set a dream leave
          



        Black has retrieved red from wherever it was on the court and placed it
        slightly in-lawn from the west boundary, north of peg-high, and left
        blue a rush to it from the east boundary. This leave gives no short shot
        for yellow, and any miss by yellow will give blue a good break
        opportunity.

 First
        Ball Options
      

East Boundary

          The most common option selected by the first ball player. A ball to
          the east boundary, somewhere between level with H4 and H5, is chosen
          due to its relative distance from both baulk lines and from H1. It is
          a completely non-threatening ball and allows the second ball player to
          dictate the nature of the game, be it defensive or aggressive.
        
In-lawn East Boundary ball

          A variation on the standard east boundary ball, the in-lawn east
          boundary ball is struck out in the same area as the standard east
          boundary ball, but purposefully left about 1 yard in from the yardline
          area. The idea behind that is so that black can play its third turn
          shot out behind blue and leave itself a rush in-court. This play
          discourages responses like a west boundary tice from red.
        
Supershot

          A supershot ball is a first-turn ball placed near the middle of the
          court, normally between H5 and peg and a couple of yards west of the
          centre line. This is the most aggressive sensible option for the first
          ball, and signals your intent to your opponent that you want no grey
          area. Given its proximity to H1, a supershot ball generally gives a
          good chance for a break for either player, depending on whether the
          third-turn, fourth-turn or fifth-turn shots are hit.
        

          There are variations on the length of the supershot, with a supershot
          played to near the peg being a poorer pioneer for H1 but having the
          advantage of lengthening any fourth-turn shot by yellow at it.
        
Anti-duffer

          This opening is an attempt to try and pre-empt the second-turn
          response and discourage a "duffer tice" by red. To lay an anti-duffer,
          you hit blue to a spot somewhere between H6 and the peg, and 1-2 yards
          west of the east boundary. The idea of placing a ball here is that if
          the opponent were to lay a duffer tice with red,
          then it gives black a good chance to hit red and take off behind blue
          for a rush to H1 on turn 3. It is a leave that is generally only used
          by strong players who have a realistic chance of a third-turn break in
          the first place.
        




              Some common first-ball scenarios
            


Unusual first-turn options

          The croquet court is a big place and so there really are endless
          options for where to place balls in the opening. Often an unusual
          option first-turn will yield good results by confusing the opponent!
        
C4 first ball

          Not often seen these days due to a preference for an east boundary
          ball 10 yards further north. A weakness of this opening is that
          shooting at partner on turn 3 and missing is liable to leave a double
          target for yellow. It also generally encourages yellow to take an
          aggressive shot on turn 4; however on a difficult lawn this opening
          can have some advantages, with any hit by yellow on turn 4 at balls in
          C4 leaving little room to promote balls into the court due to the
          close proximity to the corner.
        
C2 first ball

          Playing blue into C2 first turn can often catch the opponent off
          guard. This opening attempts to flip the tables on red and yellow by
          trying to ensure a defensive opening for blue and black. This can be a
          good option where blue and black are the stronger players and want to
          prevent aggressive second-turn options by red and yellow. Of course,
          there are options available to red and yellow which negate blue and
          black's defensive preferences.
        
Micro tice

          As unusual options go, this is right up there. This option would not
          be recommended when playing a strong player, but nevertheless is very
          interesting. The micro tice is a ball played from the end of A baulk
          towards the east boundary, but only 2-3 yards towards it, leaving a
          2-3 yard roquet for the opponent on the second turn. This length of
          shot cannot really be refused, but leaving red a croquet stroke from
          south-west of hoop 4 on the second turn of the game gives no real
          break prospects. Often the second turn player will attempt an approach
          to H1 and fail it, leaving a 6-yard roquet with two balls near H1 for
          black. This opening relies more on a tactical mistake from red than
          anything else
        
C1 / C3 opening

          Occasionally seen. Not a good opening against any experienced
          opponent, but occasionally yields results. This first-turn option is
          not to be recommended. A first-turn ball in C1 followed by a
          second-turn response to C3 (or vice versa) is a killer blow to black's
          turn.

 Second
        Ball Options
      


          This is where things start to get a little interesting. For the most
          part, the opening is dictated by the second ball response, and there
          are many more options available.
        
Response to East Boundary ball
Standard Tice

          The standard tice is one of the most popular responses to an east
          boundary ball at club-level croquet. Although in recent years it has
          fallen out of favour with top players (likely due to an increase in
          the standard of shooting), it is still a great opening that gives good
          chances to both sides.
        

          The standard tice is where red is played to the west boundary, and the
          distance it is placed north of C1 needs to be carefully considered by
          the striker or red. The name "tice" indicates that the distance should
          be enticing for the player of black to shoot at and so a distance of
          between about 8 and 13 yards is common. As a general rule, if possible
          the distance chosen should either be about 1 yard longer than the
          opponent's critical distance (the distance at which someone hits 50%
          of their shots) or 1 yard shorter (or equal to) your own critical
          distance. Obviously this cannot be achieved if your opponent has a
          longer critical distance than you do, so it is better to err slightly
          on the longer side.
        

          If blue is an in-lawn east boundary ball, laying a standard tice is
          risky, as black can quite easily lay a rush directly to it on the
          third turn.
        
C2 ball

          Probably the most common response to the east boundary ball today is
          the second-turn ball to 6" south of C2. The reason for playing just
          south of C2 is that if in the unlikely event of black shooting at red
          on turn 3, a miss will likely leave yellow a double target. The idea
          of red near C2 means that red is buried in a defensive position, and
          signals yellow's intent to shoot at blue and black on turn 4.
        

          If blue is slightly in-lawn, then C2 is the safest and most defensive
          response with red.
        
Duffer tice

          One of the more aggressive responses for red is the duffer tice. This
          is a ball that is placed usually about 2-feet north and a few inches
          east of penultimate. This is similarly enticing for the opponent to
          shoot (just as with a standard tice) but in this case a miss is
          usually more critical - any third turn shot at the duffer is in the
          direction of A baulk so black usually takes the shot gently - and by
          doing so is more likely to miss. Black missing leaves two balls in the
          centre of the court, giving yellow a great chance on turn 4. The
          duffer tice is a great option for weaker players playing against
          stronger players, and also for anyone confident in hitting 10 yarders.
        

          Between two very strong players a duffer tice is still a popular
          opening. There are variations on the placement of the ball near
          penult, based on the strength of the opponent. It is common to see a
          duffer tice placed level with, or south of, H6, particularly if the
          striker of red and yellow is a very good shot and is confident to hit
          an 11-yarder on turn 4. In a game between experts, the placement of
          red is sometimes moved to the west of H6 to discourage a third-turn
          break after a hit from black at blue.
        
C4 ball

          This option is very popular in New Zealand and although a mirror image
          of the C2 ball, is a lot more aggressive. Placing red 6" north of C4
          not only gives negligible break prospects to black on turn 3 but also
          signals your intent to hit fourth-turn with yellow and have a break. A
          miss at partner by black on turn 3 gives you a 13-yard shot for a
          4-ball break, and a miss by black at red on turn 3 usually gives a
          double target.
        
Shoot at first-turn ball

          A slightly counter-intuitive option but nonetheless an interesting
          one. Shooting red at blue on turn 2 and hitting gives no break
          prospects, but a miss also leaves very slim break prospects for black
          on turn 3 if it hits, unless black is a very strong player. With this
          opening it is quite common to see misses on both turns 2 and 3, and
          often a triple target for yellow at the other 3 balls on turn 4 from B
          baulk.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to east boundary opening
            


Response to Supershot ball

          The supershot ball is the most aggressive opening that the first-turn
          player can use. There are several responses to this which need to be
          considered, based on your assessment of your opponent's ability and
          whether the opponent has realistic prospects of a break to 4-back if
          they do manage to hit 3rd turn.
        
C2 response

          The C2 response is a ball played about 6" south of C2. This is a
          strong response to a supershot against almost all players. If the
          player of black wants to attempt a third-turn break, they will have to
          hit a 13-yarder and play a very difficult croquet stroke out of C2 to
          get a rush to H1, and this is by no means guaranteed. On the other
          hand, a miss by black at red on turn 3 will leave yellow a double
          target and a 4-ball break if hit.
        




              It is important to finish a few inches south of C2 with red as it
              will mean black missing on either side of it will leave a double
              target. Above is a comparison of yellow's target after a
              third-turn miss by black at red, firstly with red in C2 and
              secondly with red a few inches south of C2
            



          There are only a handful of players in the world where the C2 ball is
          not a great response - players who would expect to hit the 13 yarder
          most of the time and also be good enough at croquet strokes to expect
          to get a rush to H1 on the supershot ball. Against these players the
          strategy of lengthing the 3rd turn shot would be preferred.
        
C4 response

          Mirror image to the C2 response, this ball is played 6" north of C4.
          Consider this if blue (the supershot ball) is placed further north
          than normal (somewhere near peg-high), or is in a particular spot
          which may have H4 obscuring any croquet stroke from C4 towards it. It
          otherwise gives all the same advantages as the C2 response
        
Max Distance response

          As a counter to the very top players hitting the ball in C2 most of
          the time, the max distance response became popular - this is where red
          is played to the east boundary about level with the peg on the east
          boundary, leaving the longest shot possible for black. This response
          grants black a shot from C3 through red and into C4, reducing yellow's
          fourth-turn prospects - it relies more on black missing red than
          trying to make any break pick-up by black more difficult. Generally a
          good option against the very best players, but against most players is
          unnecessary.  
The reason why max distance on the east boundary is chosen instead of the equivalent max distance spot on the west boundary is that it is slightly further from the supershot ball (blue), which is slightly south-west of the peg.  Assuming that the shots on turns 3 and 4 are missed, blue's shot at red & yellow on the east boundary will be a couple of yards longer than the equivalent shot to the west boundary.  
Supershot lag

          The response for red to lag to a spot 3-4 yards east and 1-2 yards
          north of the supershot ball is a very strong and very under-used
          response to the supershot. This is a good tactic when playing someone
          who is a very good shot, and in particular if the supershot ball
          itself is quite deep (nearer the peg than H5). Placing red beside blue
          nullifies the strength of black's shooting by encouraging black to
          take its third turn shot gently (which is generally less accurate), or
          risk shooting hard and missing into B baulk, conceding a 4-ball break.
          In this case, black may choose not to shoot at all, and instead also
          lag to a position wide of the other two balls, meaning that red and
          yellow have successfully turned the tables of the supershot opening
          and enabled yellow to have the first attempted roquet.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to supershot opening
            


Roquet the Supershot ball

          The ultimate way to nullify the supershot ball - roquet it on the
          second turn. After roqueting blue with red, there are several options
          available. You can croquet blue towards C2 and then fire red off 6"
          north of C4. A more aggressive option would be to croquet blue
          north-west of H2 and fire red off the south boundary, south of H4 -
          this leaves black a choice of 7-8 yarders but minimal break prospects
          and difficult strokes with their third turn in order to distance the
          balls from baulk. A more novel option would be to crosswire blue and
          red at the peg, which leaves only a 17-yard shot for black with a
          baulk line in the background. An even more interesting option might be
          to roll blue close to the peg, either east or west, and then play red
          a yard or two away from it, wiring blue's backswing at red. This means
          that black probably has no lag option towards blue that doesn't leave
          a double-target for yellow.
        
Response to unusual first-turn options
Response to a first-turn C2 ball

          A first-turn C2 ball is an attempt by blue to make red conform to a
          defensive opening. Red could of course do this if it wants, by playing
          6" north of C4, or even by just having a "standard" east boundary
          ball; however a better option to negate blue's attempt at dictating
          the opening might be to set a duffer tice - this is the ultimate
          aggressive response to the C2 ball, and means that black is suddenly
          faced with having to hit a 10-13 yarder on turn 3 or risk leaving the
          same for yellow next turn, and a laid break.
        
Back to top



 Third
        Ball Options
      

        For the vast majority of players, if they manage to hit in on the third
        turn of the game, they will and should be looking to make a dream leave
        (see top of page) or similar, possibly with red near the peg and blue &
        black with a rush towards it. There are exceptions to this line of play,
        mainly with supershot openings, but unless otherwise stated, the
        standard play would be to try and set a dream leave.
      

Response to WB tice after EB opening

          Realistically, black will not be attempting to make any break on turn
          3 if it manages to hit in. The player of black has to make a judgement
          call on their likelihood of hitting the standard tice vs their
          opponent's likelihood of missing it.
        


            If the tice is long, the best response is probably to shoot black at
            blue from A baulk. Missing black at blue leaves the free shot at the
            tice for yellow of course, which does give yellow fairly good
            prospects if hit. If the tice is extremely long, say peg-high, then
            black could quite feasibly just lag at blue and attempt to leave a
            rush to red. Bear in mind that playing this lag so early in the game
            may be difficult as you may not have the pace of the court - and
            there is a risk that lagging at blue and falling short will leave
            yellow a double target on turn 4.
          

            Another option if black is uncertain, would be to shoot at blue from
            C3, and missing through to C4. This hedges black's bets somewhat, as
            it is still taking a shot at a ball and still somewhat joining with
            partner ball, but does not give good break prospects to the opponent
            if yellow hits, due to the proximity of blue and black to one
            another. Yellow is faced with a long takeoff from red towards blue
            and black and in all likelihood will not get a rush to H1 from this
            position.
          

            The third option is of course to shoot at the tice itself. Hitting
            red will give the opportunity to make a dream leave (as shown at the
            top of the page). Missing red will send black towards C2, which will
            give black a free shot back through red and yellow if yellow misses
            its fourth-turn shot at red.
          





              Some common third-ball responses to a standard tice
            


Response to C2 ball after EB opening

          There are two common options after a second-turn C2 ball - both
          consist of shooting at partner. If partner is hit, then usually the
          play will be to take off to the red in C2, roquet it and then croquet
          it either into the centre of the court, or along the west boundary,
          then lag back to partner and leave a rush in-court. However, consider
          a game where you are the stronger player playing a very capable weaker
          player, if you do hit partner third turn, you can elect to just set a
          rush to the C2 ball instead of trying to retrieve it from C2. As the
          stronger player you may prefer this line of play, instead of digging
          out the C2 ball only for your opponent to hit on turn 4 and have an
          easy break.
        

          Usually the third-turn shot at partner with black will be from A
          baulk, joining up on the east boundary if missed. This leaves a long
          double target for yellow from the end of B baulk. A more defensive
          play would be to shoot at partner from C3 into C4. Doing this leaves
          almost no break prospects fourth-turn for yellow but, depending on the
          distance between blue and black, may give them the opportunity to join
          up.
        

          Another option for black on turn 3 would be to shoot at red in C2 -
          however usually this is only a viable option if red is exactly in the
          corner, as it will mean that missing red on the right leaves no double
          target for yellow. Alternatively, another option would be for black to
          join up with red near C2, about 3-4 feet south of it. Doing so leaves
          no double target from B baulk and gives good break prospects to black
          if yellow misses the 13 yarder, although it must be remembered that
          yellow also has good prospects if it hits the 13 yarder. Black joining
          up with red also leaves a defensive shot for yellow at blue from C3 to
          C4 which, if missed, leaves black a very long and tricky takeoff from
          C2 to the east boundary.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a C2 ball
            


Response to C2 / C4 ball after Supershot opening

          The third-turn response to this option depends greatly on your ability
          and also the ability of your opponent. Before you lay the supershot,
          you need to ask yourself "am I realistically good enough to play a
          third-turn break to 4-back?". If the answer is no, then that does not
          mean that the supershot opening is a bad idea at all, but it just
          means that you may want to reassess your third-turn response.
          Additionally, if you are playing someone that you believe is much
          better than you are, then trying to give yourself a 4-ball break on
          turn 5 is exactly what you should be trying to achieve. Therefore,
          instead of trying to roquet the 13 yard shot of black at red just
          south of C2 (or just north of C4), you can instead look to join up
          with the ball 3-4 feet away, ensuring to leave no double target. This
          puts a great deal of pressure on your stronger opponent to then hit a
          13 yarder or else concede a 4-ball break to you.
        

          If you believe you are good enough to hit on turn 3 and play a break,
          then the answer is simple - hit red near C2 and go round.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / C2 ball
            


Response to EB ball after Supershot opening

          In most cases, the third-turn response to a max distance ball is to
          try and hit it from C3, missing into C4. Again, however, you should
          evaluate your own likelihood of playing a break to 4-back with only 3
          balls on the lawn if you hit, and so you may want to consider lagging
          to the ball, a couple of yards in-lawn from the east boundary.
        

          If the ball on the east boundary is south of the peg, it is tempting
          to simply shoot at it from A baulk. Missing will of course leave a
          double from B baulk, but the odds of yellow then hitting a double
          target from 20+ yards is no certainty. Alternatively, if the
          second-turn ball is around peg-high, then shooting at it from B baulk
          from a few yards west of C3 and missing often results in a fairly even
          spread of the balls, with your black ball being approximately 8 yards
          south of red and 8 yards north of C4. This again is technically a
          double target from somewhere on B Baulk, but given the distance
          between red and black, is easily missed and will leave your black ball
          a shot of only 8 yards.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / max distance
              ball
            


Response to C4 ball after EB opening

          This opening creates one of the more interesting third-turn decisions.
          A second-turn ball 6" north of C4 is a very threatening position and
          therefore the options will as follows:
        


            Shoot at partner
            
Hit - set a dream leave

                Miss - leaves yellow a 13-yard shot at red in C4 for a 4-ball
                break
              



            Shoot at opponent near C4 from A baulk
            

                Hit - set a dream leave (you may want to have a go at gaining a
                rush to H1 on partner)
              

                Miss - leave a 13-yard double for yellow (but slightly tricky
                break pick-up)
              



            Join up with opponent near C4, leaving no double
            

                If red is 3-6" north of C4 - join a yard north of it from A
                baulk
                
No short double target is left for yellow

                    Yellow still only has a 13-yard shot for the innings (but a
                    slightly tricky break pick-up)
                  



                If red is ~12" north of C4 - shoot from C3 through to C4
                

                    Enables black to have a shot (albeit very long) to attempt
                    to hit and set a dream leave
                  




Black to C2


              By burying itself in C2, this enables black to kill off the
              aggression by red and yellow. Any miss by yellow will leave a 9
              yarder (at most) for blue
            






              Some common third-ball responses to a C4 ball
            



          A personal preference of mine is to shoot third-turn at the ball near
          C4 from A baulk, because hitting gives me control of the court, and I
          miss often enough by more than several inches so as not to leave a
          double.
        

          Be on the lookout for cannons around C4 as part of this opening -
          there is often a good opportunity to bombard a live ball across to H1
          while playing a croquet stroke towards blue on the east boundary. This
          can make picking up the first break a great deal easier.
        
Response to duffer tice after EB opening

          The duffer tice is one of my favourite openings. Because of the
          placement of red near H6, a miss by black from the end of B baulk will
          be headed towards A baulk and give an easy start for yellow. That is
          why we see the ~9 yard shot at red refused so often, even by very
          strong players!
        

          If black does decide to shoot at the duffer and hits, then not a great
          deal of options are available other than to take off to partner ball
          (usually nudging red towards the peg in the process), and leave a rush
          towards red, and then hope for a fourth-turn miss by yellow.
        

          Another option for shooting at the duffer is doing so from C3,
          shooting across the court and missing to around peg-high (or just
          south of peg-high) on the west boundary. This is the most defensive
          shot available in that a miss gives no break to yellow if yellow hits
          red, but it also does not put any pressure on yellow's shot at red.
          Often times, when black misses the shot from C3 at red, it will end up
          south of peg-high on the west boundary and be a tempting free shot for
          yellow from C1.
        

          Shooting at partner ball on turn 3 is the most aggressive line of play
          - taking the shot from A baulk and hitting gives the opportunity to
          play a big croquet stroke loading partner to H2 and attempting to get
          a rush to H1 on the duffer ball - it is a big shot and the break
          chances are normally only reasonable for very strong players. Missing
          partner from A baulk on the other hand gives yellow a ~9 yard shot and
          very strong break prospects. It is therefore more usual to see black
          shoot at blue from C3 which, although longer, doesn't make all the
          balls available to yellow if black misses blue and yellow hits red. It
          also means that blue and black maintain a wide join and have realistic
          prospects of hitting back in if yellow misses red.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a duffer tice
            


Response to 2 balls on EB

          If red has shot at blue on turn 2 and missed, leaving both balls on
          the east boundary, you should carefully evaluate your response based
          on the strength of your opponent. If you and your opponent are evenly
          matched but not world class players, or especially if your opponent is
          a much stronger player than you, then the best thing to do here may be
          to simply ignore the two balls on the east boundary and lag black into
          the middle of the court and wait for yellow to miss. This potentially
          presents you with an immediate break with a ball in the middle of the
          court.
        

          In a match between two very strong players it would be unusual to see
          no shot taken on turn 3, and if hit, some attempt at digging out a
          3-ball break.
        
Response to 2 balls in-court

          In a situation where you have laid a supershot with blue, and red has
          lagged a couple of yards north east of your supershot ball, if there
          is no double target to be had from anywhere on the baulk lines, you
          must again consider your expectations after hitting third turn vs your
          opponent's likelihood of hitting fourth turn. As with previous
          options, if you are playing an opponent who on paper is a much
          stronger player, the percentage play is usually to lag the black ball
          into the middle of the court beside the other two balls (being mindful
          not to leave a double target from anywhere), which will put pressure
          on your stronger opponent to hit in or else concede the first break
          opportunity to you.
        

          If you do want to shoot with black at one of the balls in the middle,
          then consider either shooting at the easterly ball from C1 (you may
          even be able to shoot hard at this without missing to B baulk), or
          alternatively shooting at a medium pace at either blue or red from the
          closest point on A baulk. If you do shoot from the closest point, be
          sure to hit at a pace to finish slightly south of H6, both so that
          black is not a short shot from B baulk, and so that any double target
          that you leave has plenty of space between the front and back ball.
        

          If you are facing a third turn shot with black after red has
          cross-wired blue and red at the peg, check first to see if there is a
          point which you can lag to where blue won't be wired from black, and
          which won't be giving a double target from either baulk line - if
          there is such a spot, then that is the best place to lag to.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to supershot lag
            


Back to top



 Fourth Ball Options
      

The fourth-turn response is usually actually more simple than then third-turn response - although there are more possible scenarios, they almost always result in yellow trying to roquet something.  
      

Response to ignored WB tice
When black has ignored a standard west boundary tice and insetad shot at (and missed) partner on the east boundary, the obvious response is to then try and hit red yourself from C1.  If the placement of red is good, you should have ~50% chance of hitting in.  Your break prospects after hitting red are actually quite good, as you will play a take off from red to blue & black, which will automatically be sending red towards H2 as a pioneer.  On the other hand, a miss with yellow through red into C2 only gives fairly mediocre break prospects to blue & black in the next turn.
Response to missed WB tice
If black did indeed shoot at red (and miss) from C1 in the previous turn, then the obvious response is to shoot at red yourself, but from a point east of C1 so that a miss will leave yellow joined with red.  If you hit red, your best line of play would be to roll red &  yellow towards C1 and lay a rush for your next turn.  A miss from red at yellow will of course leave black a shot through red and yellow from C2 to C1 but is likely to be a very long shot at a single ball target.  A miss from black on turn 5 here also gives you a good chance at establishing a break on turn 5.  




              If black has missed the standard tice, it leaves a good opportunity to join up with red on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C2 ball after EB opening
Having played red into C2 on turn 2, if black ignores red and simply joins with blue (which is likely), then against most players your best line of play would be to shoot at blue and black with red.  Whether you shoot from A baulk or B baulk depends on factors such as the distance between blue and black (whether it is easy to make a double target from B baulk or A baulk) and the flatness of the east boundary.  If the black ball missed blue badly on the left on turn 3, blue and black may well be 2+ yards apart on the east boundary, so there is a defensive option available to yellow as well - shoot from C3 through to C4, where a miss would not give blue & black any easy opening.
If you are the weaker player against a very strong opponent, then there is a case for shooting yellow at red - at 13 yards, it is significantly shorter than any other available shot and is therefore your best chance at winning the opening.  Red missing yellow gives blue a relatively easy start and a probable break, but against a very strong opponent it can still be worth the risk.  




              Fourth-turn responses for yellow when partner is in C2 and opponent balls are on the east boundary.  
            


Response to joined / missed C2 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, if black has for some reason shot at red in C2, then assuming a double target has been left, your best aggressive option is to shoot at this, preferably hitting the northern ball, from B baulk.  A hit or a miss here will give fairly good break prospects to whomever plays the next shot, given C2's proximity to H2 - a semi-good pioneer can usually be sent to H2 while obtaining a rush to H1.
If black has instead joined up a yard south of red on turn 2, you have no double target (except from C1, but let's not consider that).  Now you have fundamentally two options - either shoot yellow at red which will give a good break opportunity if hit (and concede a good break opportunity to black if missed), or take a more defensive line by shooting yellow at blue from C3 into C4.  If yellow misses this shot, it does give black a 1-yard roquet at red for the innings, however it not only gives no break prospects, but also requires black to play several good strokes in order to have a good leave.  Black's take off from C2 to blue on the east boundary is a difficult shot, and if black doesn't succeed in roqueting blue in its next shot (either taking off short and missing blue, or taking off too far and sending black out) then yellow will have a 9-10 yard shot at blue & black from near C4.




              If black has joined a yard south of red near C2, the yellow has aggressive and defensive options available
            


Response to missed EB ball after Supershot opening
The response here depends a lot on both the length of the supershot ball and what option black chose on turn 3.  Firstly let's assume the most common scenario, with blue halfway between H5 and peg, and 1-2 yards west of the centre line, and red approximately peg high on the EB, and black in or near C4.  In this situation the best option is normally to shoot at red from A baulk, with a miss joining up around 1 yard north of it.  This leaves blue a 15-yarder at red & yellow but difficult break prospects for both players, whomever plays the next shot. 




              The common response after a third-turn miss by black at red to C4, is for yellow to shoot at red, joining if missing.  An aggressive line is to shoot at black.  A third option is yellow at blue, which is shorter and will win you the innings, but only gives good break prospects if red and black are near to each other
            


As the weaker player against a stronger player, a very aggressive line of play would be to shoot yellow from A baulk at black in C4 - this is very black and white, as a hit will give you a good chance for a 4-ball break and a miss will give black the same chance.  As the weaker player, you can strongly consider this option.  
Consider for a moment that black's third-turn shot missed red from A baulk, or perhaps missed red from west of C3, finishing 5-10 yards south of red.  In this case, yellow for look for possible double targets available from B baulk.  Consider, too, the shortest shot available, which is yellow at blue from A baulk - this is likely a 11-13 yard shot which, if hit, gives good break prospects to yellow because red and black are close together.
Response to ignored duffer tice
The vast majority of the time the best response to black ignoring red's duffer tice, is for yellow to shoot hard at red from B baulk.  Usually a duffer tice is only 9-10 yards and so it will be, by far, the shortest shot for yellow.




              The majority of the time, the fourth turn response would be to shoot yellow at the duffer.  Against a very strong player, you might be tempted by yellow at black in C4 which, although 3 yards longer, gives an easy start to your break
            


An expection to this would be if blue & black are joined on the east boundary leaving a good double target from A baulk, and so you may want to consider shooting at that instead.  Another option to consider is if black shot and missed blue from C3 to C4.  If you are playing against a much stronger opponent you may consider shooting yellow at black from A baulk into C4.  This shot is 3 yards longer than yellow at red from B baulk, but hitting this shot gives you vastly stronger break prospects than if you hit red first.
Response to missed duffer tice
If black misses the duffer tice (red) gently, the logical response is to shoot hard at either red from B baulk or black from A baulk (whichever is closer).  If black misses the duffer tice from C3 across to the west boundary, you may consider shooting at black from C1 through to C2, particularly if black is south of peg-high.  




              If the duffer tice is still in its original position at the start of turn 4, the general response is for yellow to shoot at red given its proximity to B baulk.  If black missed red from C3 however, it can be tempting to shoot at black from C1 on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C4 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, red a few inches north of C4 and black 1 yard north of blue, yellow's default response should be to shoot at red from A baulk.  Hitting this shot gives a great break opportunity, as it is a very natural stroke to croquet red to H2 while approaching blue & black up the east boundary.  
Response to 3 balls on EB
In this instance, you simply need to hit one of the balls on the east boundary - from either A baulk or B baulk, depending on length and available targets.
Response to 3 balls in-court
A supershot opening with lags by red and black essentially forces yellow to shoot at the closest ball.  A very black and white opening, good break prospects for both players on turn 4 or 5, depending on whether yellow hits or misses.  Often times, black will have take a gentle lag while attempting a roquet at either blue or red on turn 3, so this may also give yellow some target to shoot at on turn 4.

Conclusion
If you have gotten to the bottom of this article, you have probably realised by now that the number of opening options are vast.  This article could not hope to cover every eventuality, and nor does it present any new or unseen openings; rather it serves to talk through the options and thought processes for choosing a particular option, and I hope it has been useful.

Openings

        The opening is the battle between the two sides to be the first to gain
        the upper hand. Generally when we talk about openings in croquet, we are
        referring to the first 4 turns. At the very top level it is where games
        are won and lost, but at all levels it provides a fascinating array of
        options for bluffing and double-bluffing your opponent.
      
Opening priorities
As the stronger player

        The stronger player who is playing a dangerous but less experienced /
        weaker player will generally approach the opening with the intent of not
        giving away an easy break, and hence a more defensive mindset. Openings
        where there is a lot of grey area, balls on boundaries and in corners
        are best for this. The stronger player will generally rely on their
        better all-round game in order to win, and is more comfortable with
        digging balls out slowly into a break.
      
As the weaker player

        The weaker player should approach a game against a much stronger
        opponent with an attacking mindset - they will not be afraid to take on
        relatively short shots that give laid breaks, even if it means conceding
        a laid break if they miss. The weaker player should favour openings that
        have balls in-lawn and should be looking to put pressure on the stronger
        player to have to hit in.
      
Evenly-matched players

        It is quite common to see very aggressive, black and white, openings
        when two very strong players play against each other. The same is true
        for openings between evenly-matched players at lower levels, but
        generally to a lesser extent. A lot of the opening strategy depends on
        the individual mindset of the player, with some players naturally
        playing a more attacking game than others.
      

        Below are articles on various well-known (and some not-so-well-known)
        openings, which discuss options for placement of balls, and responses to
        them. For the purposes of simplicity, in the examples below, the balls
        will always be played in the following order:
      


 Blue
        

 Red
        


          Black
        


          Yellow
        


Note: there is no ball order or sequence in which the balls need to
          be added to the game in croquet - the above order is simply to keep
          things consistent for the diagrams and explanations.


        As you can probably imagine, the options in the opening are endless.
        This article attempts to talk through some of the most common options,
        and some of the most common responses to them, with the idea of
        clarifying some of the thought processes behind them.
      

The Dream Leave

        Many of the openings below will reference something known as the Dream
        Leave - this is a scenario where the third turn ball (black) has hit and
        arranged the court as follows:
      




            Black hit on turn 3 and set a dream leave
          



        Black has retrieved red from wherever it was on the court and placed it
        slightly in-lawn from the west boundary, north of peg-high, and left
        blue a rush to it from the east boundary. This leave gives no short shot
        for yellow, and any miss by yellow will give blue a good break
        opportunity.

 First
        Ball Options
      

East Boundary

          The most common option selected by the first ball player. A ball to
          the east boundary, somewhere between level with H4 and H5, is chosen
          due to its relative distance from both baulk lines and from H1. It is
          a completely non-threatening ball and allows the second ball player to
          dictate the nature of the game, be it defensive or aggressive.
        
In-lawn East Boundary ball

          A variation on the standard east boundary ball, the in-lawn east
          boundary ball is struck out in the same area as the standard east
          boundary ball, but purposefully left about 1 yard in from the yardline
          area. The idea behind that is so that black can play its third turn
          shot out behind blue and leave itself a rush in-court. This play
          discourages responses like a west boundary tice from red.
        
Supershot

          A supershot ball is a first-turn ball placed near the middle of the
          court, normally between H5 and peg and a couple of yards west of the
          centre line. This is the most aggressive sensible option for the first
          ball, and signals your intent to your opponent that you want no grey
          area. Given its proximity to H1, a supershot ball generally gives a
          good chance for a break for either player, depending on whether the
          third-turn, fourth-turn or fifth-turn shots are hit.
        

          There are variations on the length of the supershot, with a supershot
          played to near the peg being a poorer pioneer for H1 but having the
          advantage of lengthening any fourth-turn shot by yellow at it.
        
Anti-duffer

          This opening is an attempt to try and pre-empt the second-turn
          response and discourage a "duffer tice" by red. To lay an anti-duffer,
          you hit blue to a spot somewhere between H6 and the peg, and 1-2 yards
          west of the east boundary. The idea of placing a ball here is that if
          the opponent were to lay a duffer tice with red,
          then it gives black a good chance to hit red and take off behind blue
          for a rush to H1 on turn 3. It is a leave that is generally only used
          by strong players who have a realistic chance of a third-turn break in
          the first place.
        




              Some common first-ball scenarios
            


Unusual first-turn options

          The croquet court is a big place and so there really are endless
          options for where to place balls in the opening. Often an unusual
          option first-turn will yield good results by confusing the opponent!
        
C4 first ball

          Not often seen these days due to a preference for an east boundary
          ball 10 yards further north. A weakness of this opening is that
          shooting at partner on turn 3 and missing is liable to leave a double
          target for yellow. It also generally encourages yellow to take an
          aggressive shot on turn 4; however on a difficult lawn this opening
          can have some advantages, with any hit by yellow on turn 4 at balls in
          C4 leaving little room to promote balls into the court due to the
          close proximity to the corner.
        
C2 first ball

          Playing blue into C2 first turn can often catch the opponent off
          guard. This opening attempts to flip the tables on red and yellow by
          trying to ensure a defensive opening for blue and black. This can be a
          good option where blue and black are the stronger players and want to
          prevent aggressive second-turn options by red and yellow. Of course,
          there are options available to red and yellow which negate blue and
          black's defensive preferences.
        
Micro tice

          As unusual options go, this is right up there. This option would not
          be recommended when playing a strong player, but nevertheless is very
          interesting. The micro tice is a ball played from the end of A baulk
          towards the east boundary, but only 2-3 yards towards it, leaving a
          2-3 yard roquet for the opponent on the second turn. This length of
          shot cannot really be refused, but leaving red a croquet stroke from
          south-west of hoop 4 on the second turn of the game gives no real
          break prospects. Often the second turn player will attempt an approach
          to H1 and fail it, leaving a 6-yard roquet with two balls near H1 for
          black. This opening relies more on a tactical mistake from red than
          anything else
        
C1 / C3 opening

          Occasionally seen. Not a good opening against any experienced
          opponent, but occasionally yields results. This first-turn option is
          not to be recommended. A first-turn ball in C1 followed by a
          second-turn response to C3 (or vice versa) is a killer blow to black's
          turn.
        
Back to top




 Second
        Ball Options
      


          This is where things start to get a little interesting. For the most
          part, the opening is dictated by the second ball response, and there
          are many more options available.
        
Response to East Boundary ball
Standard Tice

          The standard tice is one of the most popular responses to an east
          boundary ball at club-level croquet. Although in recent years it has
          fallen out of favour with top players (likely due to an increase in
          the standard of shooting), it is still a great opening that gives good
          chances to both sides.
        

          The standard tice is where red is played to the west boundary, and the
          distance it is placed north of C1 needs to be carefully considered by
          the striker or red. The name "tice" indicates that the distance should
          be enticing for the player of black to shoot at and so a distance of
          between about 8 and 13 yards is common. As a general rule, if possible
          the distance chosen should either be about 1 yard longer than the
          opponent's critical distance (the distance at which someone hits 50%
          of their shots) or 1 yard shorter (or equal to) your own critical
          distance. Obviously this cannot be achieved if your opponent has a
          longer critical distance than you do, so it is better to err slightly
          on the longer side.
        

          If blue is an in-lawn east boundary ball, laying a standard tice is
          risky, as black can quite easily lay a rush directly to it on the
          third turn.
        
C2 ball

          Probably the most common response to the east boundary ball today is
          the second-turn ball to 6" south of C2. The reason for playing just
          south of C2 is that if in the unlikely event of black shooting at red
          on turn 3, a miss will likely leave yellow a double target. The idea
          of red near C2 means that red is buried in a defensive position, and
          signals yellow's intent to shoot at blue and black on turn 4.
        

          If blue is slightly in-lawn, then C2 is the safest and most defensive
          response with red.
        
Duffer tice

          One of the more aggressive responses for red is the duffer tice. This
          is a ball that is placed usually about 2-feet north and a few inches
          east of penultimate. This is similarly enticing for the opponent to
          shoot (just as with a standard tice) but in this case a miss is
          usually more critical - any third turn shot at the duffer is in the
          direction of A baulk so black usually takes the shot gently - and by
          doing so is more likely to miss. Black missing leaves two balls in the
          centre of the court, giving yellow a great chance on turn 4. The
          duffer tice is a great option for weaker players playing against
          stronger players, and also for anyone confident in hitting 10 yarders.
        

          Between two very strong players a duffer tice is still a popular
          opening. There are variations on the placement of the ball near
          penult, based on the strength of the opponent. It is common to see a
          duffer tice placed level with, or south of, H6, particularly if the
          striker of red and yellow is a very good shot and is confident to hit
          an 11-yarder on turn 4. In a game between experts, the placement of
          red is sometimes moved to the west of H6 to discourage a third-turn
          break after a hit from black at blue.
        
C4 ball

          This option is very popular in New Zealand and although a mirror image
          of the C2 ball, is a lot more aggressive. Placing red 6" north of C4
          not only gives negligible break prospects to black on turn 3 but also
          signals your intent to hit fourth-turn with yellow and have a break. A
          miss at partner by black on turn 3 gives you a 13-yard shot for a
          4-ball break, and a miss by black at red on turn 3 usually gives a
          double target.
        
Shoot at first-turn ball

          A slightly counter-intuitive option but nonetheless an interesting
          one. Shooting red at blue on turn 2 and hitting gives no break
          prospects, but a miss also leaves very slim break prospects for black
          on turn 3 if it hits, unless black is a very strong player. With this
          opening it is quite common to see misses on both turns 2 and 3, and
          often a triple target for yellow at the other 3 balls on turn 4 from B
          baulk.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to east boundary opening
            


Response to Supershot ball

          The supershot ball is the most aggressive opening that the first-turn
          player can use. There are several responses to this which need to be
          considered, based on your assessment of your opponent's ability and
          whether the opponent has realistic prospects of a break to 4-back if
          they do manage to hit 3rd turn.
        
C2 response

          The C2 response is a ball played about 6" south of C2. This is a
          strong response to a supershot against almost all players. If the
          player of black wants to attempt a third-turn break, they will have to
          hit a 13-yarder and play a very difficult croquet stroke out of C2 to
          get a rush to H1, and this is by no means guaranteed. On the other
          hand, a miss by black at red on turn 3 will leave yellow a double
          target and a 4-ball break if hit.
        




              It is important to finish a few inches south of C2 with red as it
              will mean black missing on either side of it will leave a double
              target. Above is a comparison of yellow's target after a
              third-turn miss by black at red, firstly with red in C2 and
              secondly with red a few inches south of C2
            



          There are only a handful of players in the world where the C2 ball is
          not a great response - players who would expect to hit the 13 yarder
          most of the time and also be good enough at croquet strokes to expect
          to get a rush to H1 on the supershot ball. Against these players the
          strategy of lengthing the 3rd turn shot would be preferred.
        
C4 response

          Mirror image to the C2 response, this ball is played 6" north of C4.
          Consider this if blue (the supershot ball) is placed further north
          than normal (somewhere near peg-high), or is in a particular spot
          which may have H4 obscuring any croquet stroke from C4 towards it. It
          otherwise gives all the same advantages as the C2 response
        
Max Distance response

          As a counter to the very top players hitting the ball in C2 most of
          the time, the max distance response became popular - this is where red
          is played to the east boundary about level with the peg on the east
          boundary, leaving the longest shot possible for black. This response
          grants black a shot from C3 through red and into C4, reducing yellow's
          fourth-turn prospects - it relies more on black missing red than
          trying to make any break pick-up by black more difficult. Generally a
          good option against the very best players, but against most players is
          unnecessary.  
The reason why max distance on the east boundary is chosen instead of the equivalent max distance spot on the west boundary is that it is slightly further from the supershot ball (blue), which is slightly south-west of the peg.  Assuming that the shots on turns 3 and 4 are missed, blue's shot at red & yellow on the east boundary will be a couple of yards longer than the equivalent shot to the west boundary.  
Supershot lag

          The response for red to lag to a spot 3-4 yards east and 1-2 yards
          north of the supershot ball is a very strong and very under-used
          response to the supershot. This is a good tactic when playing someone
          who is a very good shot, and in particular if the supershot ball
          itself is quite deep (nearer the peg than H5). Placing red beside blue
          nullifies the strength of black's shooting by encouraging black to
          take its third turn shot gently (which is generally less accurate), or
          risk shooting hard and missing into B baulk, conceding a 4-ball break.
          In this case, black may choose not to shoot at all, and instead also
          lag to a position wide of the other two balls, meaning that red and
          yellow have successfully turned the tables of the supershot opening
          and enabled yellow to have the first attempted roquet.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to supershot opening
            


Roquet the Supershot ball

          The ultimate way to nullify the supershot ball - roquet it on the
          second turn. After roqueting blue with red, there are several options
          available. You can croquet blue towards C2 and then fire red off 6"
          north of C4. A more aggressive option would be to croquet blue
          north-west of H2 and fire red off the south boundary, south of H4 -
          this leaves black a choice of 7-8 yarders but minimal break prospects
          and difficult strokes with their third turn in order to distance the
          balls from baulk. A more novel option would be to crosswire blue and
          red at the peg, which leaves only a 17-yard shot for black with a
          baulk line in the background. An even more interesting option might be
          to roll blue close to the peg, either east or west, and then play red
          a yard or two away from it, wiring blue's backswing at red. This means
          that black probably has no lag option towards blue that doesn't leave
          a double-target for yellow.
        
Response to unusual first-turn options
Response to a first-turn C2 ball

          A first-turn C2 ball is an attempt by blue to make red conform to a
          defensive opening. Red could of course do this if it wants, by playing
          6" north of C4, or even by just having a "standard" east boundary
          ball; however a better option to negate blue's attempt at dictating
          the opening might be to set a duffer tice - this is the ultimate
          aggressive response to the C2 ball, and means that black is suddenly
          faced with having to hit a 10-13 yarder on turn 3 or risk leaving the
          same for yellow next turn, and a laid break.
        
Back to top



 Third
        Ball Options
      

        For the vast majority of players, if they manage to hit in on the third
        turn of the game, they will and should be looking to make a dream leave
        (see top of page) or similar, possibly with red near the peg and blue &
        black with a rush towards it. There are exceptions to this line of play,
        mainly with supershot openings, but unless otherwise stated, the
        standard play would be to try and set a dream leave.
      

Response to WB tice after EB opening

          Realistically, black will not be attempting to make any break on turn
          3 if it manages to hit in. The player of black has to make a judgement
          call on their likelihood of hitting the standard tice vs their
          opponent's likelihood of missing it.
        


            If the tice is long, the best response is probably to shoot black at
            blue from A baulk. Missing black at blue leaves the free shot at the
            tice for yellow of course, which does give yellow fairly good
            prospects if hit. If the tice is extremely long, say peg-high, then
            black could quite feasibly just lag at blue and attempt to leave a
            rush to red. Bear in mind that playing this lag so early in the game
            may be difficult as you may not have the pace of the court - and
            there is a risk that lagging at blue and falling short will leave
            yellow a double target on turn 4.
          

            Another option if black is uncertain, would be to shoot at blue from
            C3, and missing through to C4. This hedges black's bets somewhat, as
            it is still taking a shot at a ball and still somewhat joining with
            partner ball, but does not give good break prospects to the opponent
            if yellow hits, due to the proximity of blue and black to one
            another. Yellow is faced with a long takeoff from red towards blue
            and black and in all likelihood will not get a rush to H1 from this
            position.
          

            The third option is of course to shoot at the tice itself. Hitting
            red will give the opportunity to make a dream leave (as shown at the
            top of the page). Missing red will send black towards C2, which will
            give black a free shot back through red and yellow if yellow misses
            its fourth-turn shot at red.
          





              Some common third-ball responses to a standard tice
            


Response to C2 ball after EB opening

          There are two common options after a second-turn C2 ball - both
          consist of shooting at partner. If partner is hit, then usually the
          play will be to take off to the red in C2, roquet it and then croquet
          it either into the centre of the court, or along the west boundary,
          then lag back to partner and leave a rush in-court. However, consider
          a game where you are the stronger player playing a very capable weaker
          player, if you do hit partner third turn, you can elect to just set a
          rush to the C2 ball instead of trying to retrieve it from C2. As the
          stronger player you may prefer this line of play, instead of digging
          out the C2 ball only for your opponent to hit on turn 4 and have an
          easy break.
        

          Usually the third-turn shot at partner with black will be from A
          baulk, joining up on the east boundary if missed. This leaves a long
          double target for yellow from the end of B baulk. A more defensive
          play would be to shoot at partner from C3 into C4. Doing this leaves
          almost no break prospects fourth-turn for yellow but, depending on the
          distance between blue and black, may give them the opportunity to join
          up.
        

          Another option for black on turn 3 would be to shoot at red in C2 -
          however usually this is only a viable option if red is exactly in the
          corner, as it will mean that missing red on the right leaves no double
          target for yellow. Alternatively, another option would be for black to
          join up with red near C2, about 3-4 feet south of it. Doing so leaves
          no double target from B baulk and gives good break prospects to black
          if yellow misses the 13 yarder, although it must be remembered that
          yellow also has good prospects if it hits the 13 yarder. Black joining
          up with red also leaves a defensive shot for yellow at blue from C3 to
          C4 which, if missed, leaves black a very long and tricky takeoff from
          C2 to the east boundary.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a C2 ball
            


Response to C2 / C4 ball after Supershot opening

          The third-turn response to this option depends greatly on your ability
          and also the ability of your opponent. Before you lay the supershot,
          you need to ask yourself "am I realistically good enough to play a
          third-turn break to 4-back?". If the answer is no, then that does not
          mean that the supershot opening is a bad idea at all, but it just
          means that you may want to reassess your third-turn response.
          Additionally, if you are playing someone that you believe is much
          better than you are, then trying to give yourself a 4-ball break on
          turn 5 is exactly what you should be trying to achieve. Therefore,
          instead of trying to roquet the 13 yard shot of black at red just
          south of C2 (or just north of C4), you can instead look to join up
          with the ball 3-4 feet away, ensuring to leave no double target. This
          puts a great deal of pressure on your stronger opponent to then hit a
          13 yarder or else concede a 4-ball break to you.
        

          If you believe you are good enough to hit on turn 3 and play a break,
          then the answer is simple - hit red near C2 and go round.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / C2 ball
            


Response to EB ball after Supershot opening

          In most cases, the third-turn response to a max distance ball is to
          try and hit it from C3, missing into C4. Again, however, you should
          evaluate your own likelihood of playing a break to 4-back with only 3
          balls on the lawn if you hit, and so you may want to consider lagging
          to the ball, a couple of yards in-lawn from the east boundary.
        

          If the ball on the east boundary is south of the peg, it is tempting
          to simply shoot at it from A baulk. Missing will of course leave a
          double from B baulk, but the odds of yellow then hitting a double
          target from 20+ yards is no certainty. Alternatively, if the
          second-turn ball is around peg-high, then shooting at it from B baulk
          from a few yards west of C3 and missing often results in a fairly even
          spread of the balls, with your black ball being approximately 8 yards
          south of red and 8 yards north of C4. This again is technically a
          double target from somewhere on B Baulk, but given the distance
          between red and black, is easily missed and will leave your black ball
          a shot of only 8 yards.

              ball
            


Response to C4 ball after EB opening

          This opening creates one of the more interesting third-turn decisions.
          A second-turn ball 6" north of C4 is a very threatening position and
          therefore the options will as follows:
        


            Shoot at partner
            
Hit - set a dream leave

                Miss - leaves yellow a 13-yard shot at red in C4 for a 4-ball
                break
              



            Shoot at opponent near C4 from A baulk
            

                Hit - set a dream leave (you may want to have a go at gaining a
                rush to H1 on partner)
              

                Miss - leave a 13-yard double for yellow (but slightly tricky
                break pick-up)
              



            Join up with opponent near C4, leaving no double
            

                If red is 3-6" north of C4 - join a yard north of it from A
                baulk
                
No short double target is left for yellow

                    Yellow still only has a 13-yard shot for the innings (but a
                    slightly tricky break pick-up)
                  



                If red is ~12" north of C4 - shoot from C3 through to C4
                

                    Enables black to have a shot (albeit very long) to attempt
                    to hit and set a dream leave
                  




Black to C2


              By burying itself in C2, this enables black to kill off the
              aggression by red and yellow. Any miss by yellow will leave a 9
              yarder (at most) for blue
            






              Some common third-ball responses to a C4 ball
            



          A personal preference of mine is to shoot third-turn at the ball near
          C4 from A baulk, because hitting gives me control of the court, and I
          miss often enough by more than several inches so as not to leave a
          double.
        

          Be on the lookout for cannons around C4 as part of this opening -
          there is often a good opportunity to bombard a live ball across to H1
          while playing a croquet stroke towards blue on the east boundary. This
          can make picking up the first break a great deal easier.
        
Response to duffer tice after EB opening

          The duffer tice is one of my favourite openings. Because of the
          placement of red near H6, a miss by black from the end of B baulk will
          be headed towards A baulk and give an easy start for yellow. That is
          why we see the ~9 yard shot at red refused so often, even by very
          strong players!
        

          If black does decide to shoot at the duffer and hits, then not a great
          deal of options are available other than to take off to partner ball
          (usually nudging red towards the peg in the process), and leave a rush
          towards red, and then hope for a fourth-turn miss by yellow.
        

          Another option for shooting at the duffer is doing so from C3,
          shooting across the court and missing to around peg-high (or just
          south of peg-high) on the west boundary. This is the most defensive
          shot available in that a miss gives no break to yellow if yellow hits
          red, but it also does not put any pressure on yellow's shot at red.
          Often times, when black misses the shot from C3 at red, it will end up
          south of peg-high on the west boundary and be a tempting free shot for
          yellow from C1.
        

          Shooting at partner ball on turn 3 is the most aggressive line of play
          - taking the shot from A baulk and hitting gives the opportunity to
          play a big croquet stroke loading partner to H2 and attempting to get
          a rush to H1 on the duffer ball - it is a big shot and the break
          chances are normally only reasonable for very strong players. Missing
          partner from A baulk on the other hand gives yellow a ~9 yard shot and
          very strong break prospects. It is therefore more usual to see black
          shoot at blue from C3 which, although longer, doesn't make all the
          balls available to yellow if black misses blue and yellow hits red. It
          also means that blue and black maintain a wide join and have realistic
          prospects of hitting back in if yellow misses red.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a duffer tice
            


Response to 2 balls on EB

          If red has shot at blue on turn 2 and missed, leaving both balls on
          the east boundary, you should carefully evaluate your response based
          on the strength of your opponent. If you and your opponent are evenly
          matched but not world class players, or especially if your opponent is
          a much stronger player than you, then the best thing to do here may be
          to simply ignore the two balls on the east boundary and lag black into
          the middle of the court and wait for yellow to miss. This potentially
          presents you with an immediate break with a ball in the middle of the
          court.
        

          In a match between two very strong players it would be unusual to see
          no shot taken on turn 3, and if hit, some attempt at digging out a
          3-ball break.
        
Response to 2 balls in-court

          In a situation where you have laid a supershot with blue, and red has
          lagged a couple of yards north east of your supershot ball, if there
          is no double target to be had from anywhere on the baulk lines, you
          must again consider your expectations after hitting third turn vs your
          opponent's likelihood of hitting fourth turn. As with previous
          options, if you are playing an opponent who on paper is a much
          stronger player, the percentage play is usually to lag the black ball
          into the middle of the court beside the other two balls (being mindful
          not to leave a double target from anywhere), which will put pressure
          on your stronger opponent to hit in or else concede the first break
          opportunity to you.
        

          If you do want to shoot with black at one of the balls in the middle,
          then consider either shooting at the easterly ball from C1 (you may
          even be able to shoot hard at this without missing to B baulk), or
          alternatively shooting at a medium pace at either blue or red from the
          closest point on A baulk. If you do shoot from the closest point, be
          sure to hit at a pace to finish slightly south of H6, both so that
          black is not a short shot from B baulk, and so that any double target
          that you leave has plenty of space between the front and back ball.
        

          If you are facing a third turn shot with black after red has
          cross-wired blue and red at the peg, check first to see if there is a
          point which you can lag to where blue won't be wired from black, and
          which won't be giving a double target from either baulk line - if
          there is such a spot, then that is the best place to lag to.

Back to top



 Fourth Ball Options
      

The fourth-turn response is usually actually more simple than then third-turn response - although there are more possible scenarios, they almost always result in yellow trying to roquet something.  
      

Response to ignored WB tice
When black has ignored a standard west boundary tice and insetad shot at (and missed) partner on the east boundary, the obvious response is to then try and hit red yourself from C1.  If the placement of red is good, you should have ~50% chance of hitting in.  Your break prospects after hitting red are actually quite good, as you will play a take off from red to blue & black, which will automatically be sending red towards H2 as a pioneer.  On the other hand, a miss with yellow through red into C2 only gives fairly mediocre break prospects to blue & black in the next turn.
Response to missed WB tice
If black did indeed shoot at red (and miss) from C1 in the previous turn, then the obvious response is to shoot at red yourself, but from a point east of C1 so that a miss will leave yellow joined with red.  If you hit red, your best line of play would be to roll red &  yellow towards C1 and lay a rush for your next turn.  A miss from red at yellow will of course leave black a shot through red and yellow from C2 to C1 but is likely to be a very long shot at a single ball target.  A miss from black on turn 5 here also gives you a good chance at establishing a break on turn 5.  




              If black has missed the standard tice, it leaves a good opportunity to join up with red on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C2 ball after EB opening
Having played red into C2 on turn 2, if black ignores red and simply joins with blue (which is likely), then against most players your best line of play would be to shoot at blue and black with red.  Whether you shoot from A baulk or B baulk depends on factors such as the distance between blue and black (whether it is easy to make a double target from B baulk or A baulk) and the flatness of the east boundary.  If the black ball missed blue badly on the left on turn 3, blue and black may well be 2+ yards apart on the east boundary, so there is a defensive option available to yellow as well - shoot from C3 through to C4, where a miss would not give blue & black any easy opening.
If you are the weaker player against a very strong opponent, then there is a case for shooting yellow at red - at 13 yards, it is significantly shorter than any other available shot and is therefore your best chance at winning the opening.  Red missing yellow gives blue a relatively easy start and a probable break, but against a very strong opponent it can still be worth the risk.  




              Fourth-turn responses for yellow when partner is in C2 and opponent balls are on the east boundary.  
            


Response to joined / missed C2 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, if black has for some reason shot at red in C2, then assuming a double target has been left, your best aggressive option is to shoot at this, preferably hitting the northern ball, from B baulk.  A hit or a miss here will give fairly good break prospects to whomever plays the next shot, given C2's proximity to H2 - a semi-good pioneer can usually be sent to H2 while obtaining a rush to H1.
If black has instead joined up a yard south of red on turn 2, you have no double target (except from C1, but let's not consider that).  Now you have fundamentally two options - either shoot yellow at red which will give a good break opportunity if hit (and concede a good break opportunity to black if missed), or take a more defensive line by shooting yellow at blue from C3 into C4.  If yellow misses this shot, it does give black a 1-yard roquet at red for the innings, however it not only gives no break prospects, but also requires black to play several good strokes in order to have a good leave.  Black's take off from C2 to blue on the east boundary is a difficult shot, and if black doesn't succeed in roqueting blue in its next shot (either taking off short and missing blue, or taking off too far and sending black out) then yellow will have a 9-10 yard shot at blue & black from near C4.




              If black has joined a yard south of red near C2, the yellow has aggressive and defensive options available
            


Response to missed EB ball after Supershot opening
The response here depends a lot on both the length of the supershot ball and what option black chose on turn 3.  Firstly let's assume the most common scenario, with blue halfway between H5 and peg, and 1-2 yards west of the centre line, and red approximately peg high on the EB, and black in or near C4.  In this situation the best option is normally to shoot at red from A baulk, with a miss joining up around 1 yard north of it.  This leaves blue a 15-yarder at red & yellow but difficult break prospects for both players, whomever plays the next shot. 




              The common response after a third-turn miss by black at red to C4, is for yellow to shoot at red, joining if missing.  An aggressive line is to shoot at black.  A third option is yellow at blue, which is shorter and will win you the innings, but only gives good break prospects if red and black are near to each other
            


As the weaker player against a stronger player, a very aggressive line of play would be to shoot yellow from A baulk at black in C4 - this is very black and white, as a hit will give you a good chance for a 4-ball break and a miss will give black the same chance.  As the weaker player, you can strongly consider this option.  
Consider for a moment that black's third-turn shot missed red from A baulk, or perhaps missed red from west of C3, finishing 5-10 yards south of red.  In this case, yellow for look for possible double targets available from B baulk.  Consider, too, the shortest shot available, which is yellow at blue from A baulk - this is likely a 11-13 yard shot which, if hit, gives good break prospects to yellow because red and black are close together.
Response to ignored duffer tice
The vast majority of the time the best response to black ignoring red's duffer tice, is for yellow to shoot hard at red from B baulk.  Usually a duffer tice is only 9-10 yards and so it will be, by far, the shortest shot for yellow.




              The majority of the time, the fourth turn response would be to shoot yellow at the duffer.  Against a very strong player, you might be tempted by yellow at black in C4 which, although 3 yards longer, gives an easy start to your break
            


An expection to this would be if blue & black are joined on the east boundary leaving a good double target from A baulk, and so you may want to consider shooting at that instead.  Another option to consider is if black shot and missed blue from C3 to C4.  If you are playing against a much stronger opponent you may consider shooting yellow at black from A baulk into C4.  This shot is 3 yards longer than yellow at red from B baulk, but hitting this shot gives you vastly stronger break prospects than if you hit red first.
Response to missed duffer tice
If black misses the duffer tice (red) gently, the logical response is to shoot hard at either red from B baulk or black from A baulk (whichever is closer).  If black misses the duffer tice from C3 across to the west boundary, you may consider shooting at black from C1 through to C2, particularly if black is south of peg-high.  




              If the duffer tice is still in its original position at the start of turn 4, the general response is for yellow to shoot at red given its proximity to B baulk.  If black missed red from C3 however, it can be tempting to shoot at black from C1 on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C4 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, red a few inches north of C4 and black 1 yard north of blue, yellow's default response should be to shoot at red from A baulk.  Hitting this shot gives a great break opportunity, as it is a very natural stroke to croquet red to H2 while approaching blue & black up the east boundary.  
Response to 3 balls on EB
In this instance, you simply need to hit one of the balls on the east boundary - from either A baulk or B baulk, depending on length and available targets.
Response to 3 balls in-court
A supershot opening with lags by red and black essentially forces yellow to shoot at the closest ball.  A very black and white opening, good break prospects for both players on turn 4 or 5, depending on whether yellow hits or misses.  Often times, black will have take a gentle lag while attempting a roquet at either blue or red on turn 3, so this may also give yellow some target to shoot at on turn 4.

Conclusion
If you have gotten to the bottom of this article, you have probably realised by now that the number of opening options are vast.  This article could not hope to cover every eventuality, and nor does it present any new or unseen openings; rather it serves to talk through the options and thought processes for choosing a particular option, and I hope it has been useful.

Openings

        The opening is the battle between the two sides to be the first to gain
        the upper hand. Generally when we talk about openings in croquet, we are
        referring to the first 4 turns. At the very top level it is where games
        are won and lost, but at all levels it provides a fascinating array of
        options for bluffing and double-bluffing your opponent.
      
Opening priorities
As the stronger player

        The stronger player who is playing a dangerous but less experienced /
        weaker player will generally approach the opening with the intent of not
        giving away an easy break, and hence a more defensive mindset. Openings
        where there is a lot of grey area, balls on boundaries and in corners
        are best for this. The stronger player will generally rely on their
        better all-round game in order to win, and is more comfortable with
        digging balls out slowly into a break.
      
As the weaker player

        The weaker player should approach a game against a much stronger
        opponent with an attacking mindset - they will not be afraid to take on
        relatively short shots that give laid breaks, even if it means conceding
        a laid break if they miss. The weaker player should favour openings that
        have balls in-lawn and should be looking to put pressure on the stronger
        player to have to hit in.
      
Evenly-matched players

        It is quite common to see very aggressive, black and white, openings
        when two very strong players play against each other. The same is true
        for openings between evenly-matched players at lower levels, but
        generally to a lesser extent. A lot of the opening strategy depends on
        the individual mindset of the player, with some players naturally
        playing a more attacking game than others.
      

        Below are articles on various well-known (and some not-so-well-known)
        openings, which discuss options for placement of balls, and responses to
        them. For the purposes of simplicity, in the examples below, the balls
        will always be played in the following order:
      


 Blue
        

 Red
        


          Black
        


          Yellow
        


Note: there is no ball order or sequence in which the balls need to
          be added to the game in croquet - the above order is simply to keep
          things consistent for the diagrams and explanations.


        As you can probably imagine, the options in the opening are endless.
        This article attempts to talk through some of the most common options,
        and some of the most common responses to them, with the idea of
        clarifying some of the thought processes behind them.
      

The Dream Leave

        Many of the openings below will reference something known as the Dream
        Leave - this is a scenario where the third turn ball (black) has hit and
        arranged the court as follows:
      




            Black hit on turn 3 and set a dream leave
          



        Black has retrieved red from wherever it was on the court and placed it
        slightly in-lawn from the west boundary, north of peg-high, and left
        blue a rush to it from the east boundary. This leave gives no short shot
        for yellow, and any miss by yellow will give blue a good break
        opportunity.

 First
        Ball Options
      

East Boundary

          The most common option selected by the first ball player. A ball to
          the east boundary, somewhere between level with H4 and H5, is chosen
          due to its relative distance from both baulk lines and from H1. It is
          a completely non-threatening ball and allows the second ball player to
          dictate the nature of the game, be it defensive or aggressive.
        
In-lawn East Boundary ball

          A variation on the standard east boundary ball, the in-lawn east
          boundary ball is struck out in the same area as the standard east
          boundary ball, but purposefully left about 1 yard in from the yardline
          area. The idea behind that is so that black can play its third turn
          shot out behind blue and leave itself a rush in-court. This play
          discourages responses like a west boundary tice from red.
        
Supershot

          A supershot ball is a first-turn ball placed near the middle of the
          court, normally between H5 and peg and a couple of yards west of the
          centre line. This is the most aggressive sensible option for the first
          ball, and signals your intent to your opponent that you want no grey
          area. Given its proximity to H1, a supershot ball generally gives a
          good chance for a break for either player, depending on whether the
          third-turn, fourth-turn or fifth-turn shots are hit.
        

          There are variations on the length of the supershot, with a supershot
          played to near the peg being a poorer pioneer for H1 but having the
          advantage of lengthening any fourth-turn shot by yellow at it.
        
Anti-duffer

          This opening is an attempt to try and pre-empt the second-turn
          response and discourage a "duffer tice" by red. To lay an anti-duffer,
          you hit blue to a spot somewhere between H6 and the peg, and 1-2 yards
          west of the east boundary. The idea of placing a ball here is that if
          the opponent were to lay a duffer tice with red,
          then it gives black a good chance to hit red and take off behind blue
          for a rush to H1 on turn 3. It is a leave that is generally only used
          by strong players who have a realistic chance of a third-turn break in
          the first place.
        




              Some common first-ball scenarios
            


Unusual first-turn options

          The croquet court is a big place and so there really are endless
          options for where to place balls in the opening. Often an unusual
          option first-turn will yield good results by confusing the opponent!
        
C4 first ball

          Not often seen these days due to a preference for an east boundary
          ball 10 yards further north. A weakness of this opening is that
          shooting at partner on turn 3 and missing is liable to leave a double
          target for yellow. It also generally encourages yellow to take an
          aggressive shot on turn 4; however on a difficult lawn this opening
          can have some advantages, with any hit by yellow on turn 4 at balls in
          C4 leaving little room to promote balls into the court due to the
          close proximity to the corner.
        
C2 first ball

          Playing blue into C2 first turn can often catch the opponent off
          guard. This opening attempts to flip the tables on red and yellow by
          trying to ensure a defensive opening for blue and black. This can be a
          good option where blue and black are the stronger players and want to
          prevent aggressive second-turn options by red and yellow. Of course,
          there are options available to red and yellow which negate blue and
          black's defensive preferences.
        
Micro tice

          As unusual options go, this is right up there. This option would not
          be recommended when playing a strong player, but nevertheless is very
          interesting. The micro tice is a ball played from the end of A baulk
          towards the east boundary, but only 2-3 yards towards it, leaving a
          2-3 yard roquet for the opponent on the second turn. This length of
          shot cannot really be refused, but leaving red a croquet stroke from
          south-west of hoop 4 on the second turn of the game gives no real
          break prospects. Often the second turn player will attempt an approach
          to H1 and fail it, leaving a 6-yard roquet with two balls near H1 for
          black. This opening relies more on a tactical mistake from red than
          anything else
        
C1 / C3 opening

          Occasionally seen. Not a good opening against any experienced
          opponent, but occasionally yields results. This first-turn option is
          not to be recommended. A first-turn ball in C1 followed by a
          second-turn response to C3 (or vice versa) is a killer blow to black's
          turn.
        
Back to top




 Second
        Ball Options
      


          This is where things start to get a little interesting. For the most
          part, the opening is dictated by the second ball response, and there
          are many more options available.
        
Response to East Boundary ball
Standard Tice

          The standard tice is one of the most popular responses to an east
          boundary ball at club-level croquet. Although in recent years it has
          fallen out of favour with top players (likely due to an increase in
          the standard of shooting), it is still a great opening that gives good
          chances to both sides.
        

          The standard tice is where red is played to the west boundary, and the
          distance it is placed north of C1 needs to be carefully considered by
          the striker or red. The name "tice" indicates that the distance should
          be enticing for the player of black to shoot at and so a distance of
          between about 8 and 13 yards is common. As a general rule, if possible
          the distance chosen should either be about 1 yard longer than the
          opponent's critical distance (the distance at which someone hits 50%
          of their shots) or 1 yard shorter (or equal to) your own critical
          distance. Obviously this cannot be achieved if your opponent has a
          longer critical distance than you do, so it is better to err slightly
          on the longer side.
        

          If blue is an in-lawn east boundary ball, laying a standard tice is
          risky, as black can quite easily lay a rush directly to it on the
          third turn.
        
C2 ball

          Probably the most common response to the east boundary ball today is
          the second-turn ball to 6" south of C2. The reason for playing just
          south of C2 is that if in the unlikely event of black shooting at red
          on turn 3, a miss will likely leave yellow a double target. The idea
          of red near C2 means that red is buried in a defensive position, and
          signals yellow's intent to shoot at blue and black on turn 4.
        

          If blue is slightly in-lawn, then C2 is the safest and most defensive
          response with red.
        
Duffer tice

          One of the more aggressive responses for red is the duffer tice. This
          is a ball that is placed usually about 2-feet north and a few inches
          east of penultimate. This is similarly enticing for the opponent to
          shoot (just as with a standard tice) but in this case a miss is
          usually more critical - any third turn shot at the duffer is in the
          direction of A baulk so black usually takes the shot gently - and by
          doing so is more likely to miss. Black missing leaves two balls in the
          centre of the court, giving yellow a great chance on turn 4. The
          duffer tice is a great option for weaker players playing against
          stronger players, and also for anyone confident in hitting 10 yarders.
        

          Between two very strong players a duffer tice is still a popular
          opening. There are variations on the placement of the ball near
          penult, based on the strength of the opponent. It is common to see a
          duffer tice placed level with, or south of, H6, particularly if the
          striker of red and yellow is a very good shot and is confident to hit
          an 11-yarder on turn 4. In a game between experts, the placement of
          red is sometimes moved to the west of H6 to discourage a third-turn
          break after a hit from black at blue.
        
C4 ball

          This option is very popular in New Zealand and although a mirror image
          of the C2 ball, is a lot more aggressive. Placing red 6" north of C4
          not only gives negligible break prospects to black on turn 3 but also
          signals your intent to hit fourth-turn with yellow and have a break. A
          miss at partner by black on turn 3 gives you a 13-yard shot for a
          4-ball break, and a miss by black at red on turn 3 usually gives a
          double target.
        
Shoot at first-turn ball

          A slightly counter-intuitive option but nonetheless an interesting
          one. Shooting red at blue on turn 2 and hitting gives no break
          prospects, but a miss also leaves very slim break prospects for black
          on turn 3 if it hits, unless black is a very strong player. With this
          opening it is quite common to see misses on both turns 2 and 3, and
          often a triple target for yellow at the other 3 balls on turn 4 from B
          baulk.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to east boundary opening
            


Response to Supershot ball

          The supershot ball is the most aggressive opening that the first-turn
          player can use. There are several responses to this which need to be
          considered, based on your assessment of your opponent's ability and
          whether the opponent has realistic prospects of a break to 4-back if
          they do manage to hit 3rd turn.
        
C2 response

          The C2 response is a ball played about 6" south of C2. This is a
          strong response to a supershot against almost all players. If the
          player of black wants to attempt a third-turn break, they will have to
          hit a 13-yarder and play a very difficult croquet stroke out of C2 to
          get a rush to H1, and this is by no means guaranteed. On the other
          hand, a miss by black at red on turn 3 will leave yellow a double
          target and a 4-ball break if hit.
        




              It is important to finish a few inches south of C2 with red as it
              will mean black missing on either side of it will leave a double
              target. Above is a comparison of yellow's target after a
              third-turn miss by black at red, firstly with red in C2 and
              secondly with red a few inches south of C2
            



          There are only a handful of players in the world where the C2 ball is
          not a great response - players who would expect to hit the 13 yarder
          most of the time and also be good enough at croquet strokes to expect
          to get a rush to H1 on the supershot ball. Against these players the
          strategy of lengthing the 3rd turn shot would be preferred.
        
C4 response

          Mirror image to the C2 response, this ball is played 6" north of C4.
          Consider this if blue (the supershot ball) is placed further north
          than normal (somewhere near peg-high), or is in a particular spot
          which may have H4 obscuring any croquet stroke from C4 towards it. It
          otherwise gives all the same advantages as the C2 response
        
Max Distance response

          As a counter to the very top players hitting the ball in C2 most of
          the time, the max distance response became popular - this is where red
          is played to the east boundary about level with the peg on the east
          boundary, leaving the longest shot possible for black. This response
          grants black a shot from C3 through red and into C4, reducing yellow's
          fourth-turn prospects - it relies more on black missing red than
          trying to make any break pick-up by black more difficult. Generally a
          good option against the very best players, but against most players is
          unnecessary.  
The reason why max distance on the east boundary is chosen instead of the equivalent max distance spot on the west boundary is that it is slightly further from the supershot ball (blue), which is slightly south-west of the peg.  Assuming that the shots on turns 3 and 4 are missed, blue's shot at red & yellow on the east boundary will be a couple of yards longer than the equivalent shot to the west boundary.  
Supershot lag

          The response for red to lag to a spot 3-4 yards east and 1-2 yards
          north of the supershot ball is a very strong and very under-used
          response to the supershot. This is a good tactic when playing someone
          who is a very good shot, and in particular if the supershot ball
          itself is quite deep (nearer the peg than H5). Placing red beside blue
          nullifies the strength of black's shooting by encouraging black to
          take its third turn shot gently (which is generally less accurate), or
          risk shooting hard and missing into B baulk, conceding a 4-ball break.
          In this case, black may choose not to shoot at all, and instead also
          lag to a position wide of the other two balls, meaning that red and
          yellow have successfully turned the tables of the supershot opening
          and enabled yellow to have the first attempted roquet.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to supershot opening
            


Roquet the Supershot ball

          The ultimate way to nullify the supershot ball - roquet it on the
          second turn. After roqueting blue with red, there are several options
          available. You can croquet blue towards C2 and then fire red off 6"
          north of C4. A more aggressive option would be to croquet blue
          north-west of H2 and fire red off the south boundary, south of H4 -
          this leaves black a choice of 7-8 yarders but minimal break prospects
          and difficult strokes with their third turn in order to distance the
          balls from baulk. A more novel option would be to crosswire blue and
          red at the peg, which leaves only a 17-yard shot for black with a
          baulk line in the background. An even more interesting option might be
          to roll blue close to the peg, either east or west, and then play red
          a yard or two away from it, wiring blue's backswing at red. This means
          that black probably has no lag option towards blue that doesn't leave
          a double-target for yellow.
        
Response to unusual first-turn options
Response to a first-turn C2 ball

          A first-turn C2 ball is an attempt by blue to make red conform to a
          defensive opening. Red could of course do this if it wants, by playing
          6" north of C4, or even by just having a "standard" east boundary
          ball; however a better option to negate blue's attempt at dictating
          the opening might be to set a duffer tice - this is the ultimate
          aggressive response to the C2 ball, and means that black is suddenly
          faced with having to hit a 10-13 yarder on turn 3 or risk leaving the
          same for yellow next turn, and a laid break.

 Third
        Ball Options
      

        For the vast majority of players, if they manage to hit in on the third
        turn of the game, they will and should be looking to make a dream leave
        (see top of page) or similar, possibly with red near the peg and blue &
        black with a rush towards it. There are exceptions to this line of play,
        mainly with supershot openings, but unless otherwise stated, the
        standard play would be to try and set a dream leave.
      

Response to WB tice after EB opening

          Realistically, black will not be attempting to make any break on turn
          3 if it manages to hit in. The player of black has to make a judgement
          call on their likelihood of hitting the standard tice vs their
          opponent's likelihood of missing it.
        


            If the tice is long, the best response is probably to shoot black at
            blue from A baulk. Missing black at blue leaves the free shot at the
            tice for yellow of course, which does give yellow fairly good
            prospects if hit. If the tice is extremely long, say peg-high, then
            black could quite feasibly just lag at blue and attempt to leave a
            rush to red. Bear in mind that playing this lag so early in the game
            may be difficult as you may not have the pace of the court - and
            there is a risk that lagging at blue and falling short will leave
            yellow a double target on turn 4.
          

            Another option if black is uncertain, would be to shoot at blue from
            C3, and missing through to C4. This hedges black's bets somewhat, as
            it is still taking a shot at a ball and still somewhat joining with
            partner ball, but does not give good break prospects to the opponent
            if yellow hits, due to the proximity of blue and black to one
            another. Yellow is faced with a long takeoff from red towards blue
            and black and in all likelihood will not get a rush to H1 from this
            position.
          

            The third option is of course to shoot at the tice itself. Hitting
            red will give the opportunity to make a dream leave (as shown at the
            top of the page). Missing red will send black towards C2, which will
            give black a free shot back through red and yellow if yellow misses
            its fourth-turn shot at red.
          





              Some common third-ball responses to a standard tice
            


Response to C2 ball after EB opening

          There are two common options after a second-turn C2 ball - both
          consist of shooting at partner. If partner is hit, then usually the
          play will be to take off to the red in C2, roquet it and then croquet
          it either into the centre of the court, or along the west boundary,
          then lag back to partner and leave a rush in-court. However, consider
          a game where you are the stronger player playing a very capable weaker
          player, if you do hit partner third turn, you can elect to just set a
          rush to the C2 ball instead of trying to retrieve it from C2. As the
          stronger player you may prefer this line of play, instead of digging
          out the C2 ball only for your opponent to hit on turn 4 and have an
          easy break.
        

          Usually the third-turn shot at partner with black will be from A
          baulk, joining up on the east boundary if missed. This leaves a long
          double target for yellow from the end of B baulk. A more defensive
          play would be to shoot at partner from C3 into C4. Doing this leaves
          almost no break prospects fourth-turn for yellow but, depending on the
          distance between blue and black, may give them the opportunity to join
          up.
        

          Another option for black on turn 3 would be to shoot at red in C2 -
          however usually this is only a viable option if red is exactly in the
          corner, as it will mean that missing red on the right leaves no double
          target for yellow. Alternatively, another option would be for black to
          join up with red near C2, about 3-4 feet south of it. Doing so leaves
          no double target from B baulk and gives good break prospects to black
          if yellow misses the 13 yarder, although it must be remembered that
          yellow also has good prospects if it hits the 13 yarder. Black joining
          up with red also leaves a defensive shot for yellow at blue from C3 to
          C4 which, if missed, leaves black a very long and tricky takeoff from
          C2 to the east boundary.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a C2 ball
            


Response to C2 / C4 ball after Supershot opening

          The third-turn response to this option depends greatly on your ability
          and also the ability of your opponent. Before you lay the supershot,
          you need to ask yourself "am I realistically good enough to play a
          third-turn break to 4-back?". If the answer is no, then that does not
          mean that the supershot opening is a bad idea at all, but it just
          means that you may want to reassess your third-turn response.
          Additionally, if you are playing someone that you believe is much
          better than you are, then trying to give yourself a 4-ball break on
          turn 5 is exactly what you should be trying to achieve. Therefore,
          instead of trying to roquet the 13 yard shot of black at red just
          south of C2 (or just north of C4), you can instead look to join up
          with the ball 3-4 feet away, ensuring to leave no double target. This
          puts a great deal of pressure on your stronger opponent to then hit a
          13 yarder or else concede a 4-ball break to you.
        

          If you believe you are good enough to hit on turn 3 and play a break,
          then the answer is simple - hit red near C2 and go round.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / C2 ball
            


Response to EB ball after Supershot opening

          In most cases, the third-turn response to a max distance ball is to
          try and hit it from C3, missing into C4. Again, however, you should
          evaluate your own likelihood of playing a break to 4-back with only 3
          balls on the lawn if you hit, and so you may want to consider lagging
          to the ball, a couple of yards in-lawn from the east boundary.
        

          If the ball on the east boundary is south of the peg, it is tempting
          to simply shoot at it from A baulk. Missing will of course leave a
          double from B baulk, but the odds of yellow then hitting a double
          target from 20+ yards is no certainty. Alternatively, if the
          second-turn ball is around peg-high, then shooting at it from B baulk
          from a few yards west of C3 and missing often results in a fairly even
          spread of the balls, with your black ball being approximately 8 yards
          south of red and 8 yards north of C4. This again is technically a
          double target from somewhere on B Baulk, but given the distance
          between red and black, is easily missed and will leave your black ball
          a shot of only 8 yards.

              ball
            


Response to C4 ball after EB opening

          This opening creates one of the more interesting third-turn decisions.
          A second-turn ball 6" north of C4 is a very threatening position and
          therefore the options will as follows:
        


            Shoot at partner
            
Hit - set a dream leave

                Miss - leaves yellow a 13-yard shot at red in C4 for a 4-ball
                break
              



            Shoot at opponent near C4 from A baulk
            

                Hit - set a dream leave (you may want to have a go at gaining a
                rush to H1 on partner)
              

                Miss - leave a 13-yard double for yellow (but slightly tricky
                break pick-up)
              



            Join up with opponent near C4, leaving no double
            

                If red is 3-6" north of C4 - join a yard north of it from A
                baulk
                
No short double target is left for yellow

                    Yellow still only has a 13-yard shot for the innings (but a
                    slightly tricky break pick-up)
                  



                If red is ~12" north of C4 - shoot from C3 through to C4
                

                    Enables black to have a shot (albeit very long) to attempt
                    to hit and set a dream leave
                  




Black to C2


              By burying itself in C2, this enables black to kill off the
              aggression by red and yellow. Any miss by yellow will leave a 9
              yarder (at most) for blue
            






              Some common third-ball responses to a C4 ball
            



          A personal preference of mine is to shoot third-turn at the ball near
          C4 from A baulk, because hitting gives me control of the court, and I
          miss often enough by more than several inches so as not to leave a
          double.
        

          Be on the lookout for cannons around C4 as part of this opening -
          there is often a good opportunity to bombard a live ball across to H1
          while playing a croquet stroke towards blue on the east boundary. This
          can make picking up the first break a great deal easier.
        
Response to duffer tice after EB opening

          The duffer tice is one of my favourite openings. Because of the
          placement of red near H6, a miss by black from the end of B baulk will
          be headed towards A baulk and give an easy start for yellow. That is
          why we see the ~9 yard shot at red refused so often, even by very
          strong players!
        

          If black does decide to shoot at the duffer and hits, then not a great
          deal of options are available other than to take off to partner ball
          (usually nudging red towards the peg in the process), and leave a rush
          towards red, and then hope for a fourth-turn miss by yellow.
        

          Another option for shooting at the duffer is doing so from C3,
          shooting across the court and missing to around peg-high (or just
          south of peg-high) on the west boundary. This is the most defensive
          shot available in that a miss gives no break to yellow if yellow hits
          red, but it also does not put any pressure on yellow's shot at red.
          Often times, when black misses the shot from C3 at red, it will end up
          south of peg-high on the west boundary and be a tempting free shot for
          yellow from C1.
        

          Shooting at partner ball on turn 3 is the most aggressive line of play
          - taking the shot from A baulk and hitting gives the opportunity to
          play a big croquet stroke loading partner to H2 and attempting to get
          a rush to H1 on the duffer ball - it is a big shot and the break
          chances are normally only reasonable for very strong players. Missing
          partner from A baulk on the other hand gives yellow a ~9 yard shot and
          very strong break prospects. It is therefore more usual to see black
          shoot at blue from C3 which, although longer, doesn't make all the
          balls available to yellow if black misses blue and yellow hits red. It
          also means that blue and black maintain a wide join and have realistic
          prospects of hitting back in if yellow misses red.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a duffer tice
            


Response to 2 balls on EB

          If red has shot at blue on turn 2 and missed, leaving both balls on
          the east boundary, you should carefully evaluate your response based
          on the strength of your opponent. If you and your opponent are evenly
          matched but not world class players, or especially if your opponent is
          a much stronger player than you, then the best thing to do here may be
          to simply ignore the two balls on the east boundary and lag black into
          the middle of the court and wait for yellow to miss. This potentially
          presents you with an immediate break with a ball in the middle of the
          court.
        

          In a match between two very strong players it would be unusual to see
          no shot taken on turn 3, and if hit, some attempt at digging out a
          3-ball break.
        
Response to 2 balls in-court

          In a situation where you have laid a supershot with blue, and red has
          lagged a couple of yards north east of your supershot ball, if there
          is no double target to be had from anywhere on the baulk lines, you
          must again consider your expectations after hitting third turn vs your
          opponent's likelihood of hitting fourth turn. As with previous
          options, if you are playing an opponent who on paper is a much
          stronger player, the percentage play is usually to lag the black ball
          into the middle of the court beside the other two balls (being mindful
          not to leave a double target from anywhere), which will put pressure
          on your stronger opponent to hit in or else concede the first break
          opportunity to you.
        

          If you do want to shoot with black at one of the balls in the middle,
          then consider either shooting at the easterly ball from C1 (you may
          even be able to shoot hard at this without missing to B baulk), or
          alternatively shooting at a medium pace at either blue or red from the
          closest point on A baulk. If you do shoot from the closest point, be
          sure to hit at a pace to finish slightly south of H6, both so that
          black is not a short shot from B baulk, and so that any double target
          that you leave has plenty of space between the front and back ball.
        

          If you are facing a third turn shot with black after red has
          cross-wired blue and red at the peg, check first to see if there is a
          point which you can lag to where blue won't be wired from black, and
          which won't be giving a double target from either baulk line - if
          there is such a spot, then that is the best place to lag to.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to supershot lag
            


Back to top



 Fourth Ball Options
      

The fourth-turn response is usually actually more simple than then third-turn response - although there are more possible scenarios, they almost always result in yellow trying to roquet something.  
      

Response to ignored WB tice
When black has ignored a standard west boundary tice and insetad shot at (and missed) partner on the east boundary, the obvious response is to then try and hit red yourself from C1.  If the placement of red is good, you should have ~50% chance of hitting in.  Your break prospects after hitting red are actually quite good, as you will play a take off from red to blue & black, which will automatically be sending red towards H2 as a pioneer.  On the other hand, a miss with yellow through red into C2 only gives fairly mediocre break prospects to blue & black in the next turn.
Response to missed WB tice
If black did indeed shoot at red (and miss) from C1 in the previous turn, then the obvious response is to shoot at red yourself, but from a point east of C1 so that a miss will leave yellow joined with red.  If you hit red, your best line of play would be to roll red &  yellow towards C1 and lay a rush for your next turn.  A miss from red at yellow will of course leave black a shot through red and yellow from C2 to C1 but is likely to be a very long shot at a single ball target.  A miss from black on turn 5 here also gives you a good chance at establishing a break on turn 5.  




              If black has missed the standard tice, it leaves a good opportunity to join up with red on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C2 ball after EB opening
Having played red into C2 on turn 2, if black ignores red and simply joins with blue (which is likely), then against most players your best line of play would be to shoot at blue and black with red.  Whether you shoot from A baulk or B baulk depends on factors such as the distance between blue and black (whether it is easy to make a double target from B baulk or A baulk) and the flatness of the east boundary.  If the black ball missed blue badly on the left on turn 3, blue and black may well be 2+ yards apart on the east boundary, so there is a defensive option available to yellow as well - shoot from C3 through to C4, where a miss would not give blue & black any easy opening.
If you are the weaker player against a very strong opponent, then there is a case for shooting yellow at red - at 13 yards, it is significantly shorter than any other available shot and is therefore your best chance at winning the opening.  Red missing yellow gives blue a relatively easy start and a probable break, but against a very strong opponent it can still be worth the risk.  




              Fourth-turn responses for yellow when partner is in C2 and opponent balls are on the east boundary.  
            


Response to joined / missed C2 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, if black has for some reason shot at red in C2, then assuming a double target has been left, your best aggressive option is to shoot at this, preferably hitting the northern ball, from B baulk.  A hit or a miss here will give fairly good break prospects to whomever plays the next shot, given C2's proximity to H2 - a semi-good pioneer can usually be sent to H2 while obtaining a rush to H1.
If black has instead joined up a yard south of red on turn 2, you have no double target (except from C1, but let's not consider that).  Now you have fundamentally two options - either shoot yellow at red which will give a good break opportunity if hit (and concede a good break opportunity to black if missed), or take a more defensive line by shooting yellow at blue from C3 into C4.  If yellow misses this shot, it does give black a 1-yard roquet at red for the innings, however it not only gives no break prospects, but also requires black to play several good strokes in order to have a good leave.  Black's take off from C2 to blue on the east boundary is a difficult shot, and if black doesn't succeed in roqueting blue in its next shot (either taking off short and missing blue, or taking off too far and sending black out) then yellow will have a 9-10 yard shot at blue & black from near C4.




              If black has joined a yard south of red near C2, the yellow has aggressive and defensive options available
            


Response to missed EB ball after Supershot opening
The response here depends a lot on both the length of the supershot ball and what option black chose on turn 3.  Firstly let's assume the most common scenario, with blue halfway between H5 and peg, and 1-2 yards west of the centre line, and red approximately peg high on the EB, and black in or near C4.  In this situation the best option is normally to shoot at red from A baulk, with a miss joining up around 1 yard north of it.  This leaves blue a 15-yarder at red & yellow but difficult break prospects for both players, whomever plays the next shot. 




              The common response after a third-turn miss by black at red to C4, is for yellow to shoot at red, joining if missing.  An aggressive line is to shoot at black.  A third option is yellow at blue, which is shorter and will win you the innings, but only gives good break prospects if red and black are near to each other
            


As the weaker player against a stronger player, a very aggressive line of play would be to shoot yellow from A baulk at black in C4 - this is very black and white, as a hit will give you a good chance for a 4-ball break and a miss will give black the same chance.  As the weaker player, you can strongly consider this option.  
Consider for a moment that black's third-turn shot missed red from A baulk, or perhaps missed red from west of C3, finishing 5-10 yards south of red.  In this case, yellow for look for possible double targets available from B baulk.  Consider, too, the shortest shot available, which is yellow at blue from A baulk - this is likely a 11-13 yard shot which, if hit, gives good break prospects to yellow because red and black are close together.
Response to ignored duffer tice
The vast majority of the time the best response to black ignoring red's duffer tice, is for yellow to shoot hard at red from B baulk.  Usually a duffer tice is only 9-10 yards and so it will be, by far, the shortest shot for yellow.




              The majority of the time, the fourth turn response would be to shoot yellow at the duffer.  Against a very strong player, you might be tempted by yellow at black in C4 which, although 3 yards longer, gives an easy start to your break
            


An expection to this would be if blue & black are joined on the east boundary leaving a good double target from A baulk, and so you may want to consider shooting at that instead.  Another option to consider is if black shot and missed blue from C3 to C4.  If you are playing against a much stronger opponent you may consider shooting yellow at black from A baulk into C4.  This shot is 3 yards longer than yellow at red from B baulk, but hitting this shot gives you vastly stronger break prospects than if you hit red first.
Response to missed duffer tice
If black misses the duffer tice (red) gently, the logical response is to shoot hard at either red from B baulk or black from A baulk (whichever is closer).  If black misses the duffer tice from C3 across to the west boundary, you may consider shooting at black from C1 through to C2, particularly if black is south of peg-high.  




              If the duffer tice is still in its original position at the start of turn 4, the general response is for yellow to shoot at red given its proximity to B baulk.  If black missed red from C3 however, it can be tempting to shoot at black from C1 on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C4 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, red a few inches north of C4 and black 1 yard north of blue, yellow's default response should be to shoot at red from A baulk.  Hitting this shot gives a great break opportunity, as it is a very natural stroke to croquet red to H2 while approaching blue & black up the east boundary.  
Response to 3 balls on EB
In this instance, you simply need to hit one of the balls on the east boundary - from either A baulk or B baulk, depending on length and available targets.
Response to 3 balls in-court
A supershot opening with lags by red and black essentially forces yellow to shoot at the closest ball.  A very black and white opening, good break prospects for both players on turn 4 or 5, depending on whether yellow hits or misses.  Often times, black will have take a gentle lag while attempting a roquet at either blue or red on turn 3, so this may also give yellow some target to shoot at on turn 4.

Conclusion
If you have gotten to the bottom of this article, you have probably realised by now that the number of opening options are vast.  This article could not hope to cover every eventuality, and nor does it present any new or unseen openings; rather it serves to talk through the options and thought processes for choosing a particular option, and I hope it has been useful.

Openings

        The opening is the battle between the two sides to be the first to gain
        the upper hand. Generally when we talk about openings in croquet, we are
        referring to the first 4 turns. At the very top level it is where games
        are won and lost, but at all levels it provides a fascinating array of
        options for bluffing and double-bluffing your opponent.
      
Opening priorities
As the stronger player

        The stronger player who is playing a dangerous but less experienced /
        weaker player will generally approach the opening with the intent of not
        giving away an easy break, and hence a more defensive mindset. Openings
        where there is a lot of grey area, balls on boundaries and in corners
        are best for this. The stronger player will generally rely on their
        better all-round game in order to win, and is more comfortable with
        digging balls out slowly into a break.
      
As the weaker player

        The weaker player should approach a game against a much stronger
        opponent with an attacking mindset - they will not be afraid to take on
        relatively short shots that give laid breaks, even if it means conceding
        a laid break if they miss. The weaker player should favour openings that
        have balls in-lawn and should be looking to put pressure on the stronger
        player to have to hit in.
      
Evenly-matched players

        It is quite common to see very aggressive, black and white, openings
        when two very strong players play against each other. The same is true
        for openings between evenly-matched players at lower levels, but
        generally to a lesser extent. A lot of the opening strategy depends on
        the individual mindset of the player, with some players naturally
        playing a more attacking game than others.
      

        Below are articles on various well-known (and some not-so-well-known)
        openings, which discuss options for placement of balls, and responses to
        them. For the purposes of simplicity, in the examples below, the balls
        will always be played in the following order:
      


 Blue
        

 Red
        


          Black
        


          Yellow
        


Note: there is no ball order or sequence in which the balls need to
          be added to the game in croquet - the above order is simply to keep
          things consistent for the diagrams and explanations.


        As you can probably imagine, the options in the opening are endless.
        This article attempts to talk through some of the most common options,
        and some of the most common responses to them, with the idea of
        clarifying some of the thought processes behind them.
      

The Dream Leave

        Many of the openings below will reference something known as the Dream
        Leave - this is a scenario where the third turn ball (black) has hit and
        arranged the court as follows:
      




            Black hit on turn 3 and set a dream leave
          



        Black has retrieved red from wherever it was on the court and placed it
        slightly in-lawn from the west boundary, north of peg-high, and left
        blue a rush to it from the east boundary. This leave gives no short shot
        for yellow, and any miss by yellow will give blue a good break
        opportunity.

 First
        Ball Options
      

East Boundary

          The most common option selected by the first ball player. A ball to
          the east boundary, somewhere between level with H4 and H5, is chosen
          due to its relative distance from both baulk lines and from H1. It is
          a completely non-threatening ball and allows the second ball player to
          dictate the nature of the game, be it defensive or aggressive.
        
In-lawn East Boundary ball

          A variation on the standard east boundary ball, the in-lawn east
          boundary ball is struck out in the same area as the standard east
          boundary ball, but purposefully left about 1 yard in from the yardline
          area. The idea behind that is so that black can play its third turn
          shot out behind blue and leave itself a rush in-court. This play
          discourages responses like a west boundary tice from red.
        
Supershot

          A supershot ball is a first-turn ball placed near the middle of the
          court, normally between H5 and peg and a couple of yards west of the
          centre line. This is the most aggressive sensible option for the first
          ball, and signals your intent to your opponent that you want no grey
          area. Given its proximity to H1, a supershot ball generally gives a
          good chance for a break for either player, depending on whether the
          third-turn, fourth-turn or fifth-turn shots are hit.
        

          There are variations on the length of the supershot, with a supershot
          played to near the peg being a poorer pioneer for H1 but having the
          advantage of lengthening any fourth-turn shot by yellow at it.
        
Anti-duffer

          This opening is an attempt to try and pre-empt the second-turn
          response and discourage a "duffer tice" by red. To lay an anti-duffer,
          you hit blue to a spot somewhere between H6 and the peg, and 1-2 yards
          west of the east boundary. The idea of placing a ball here is that if
          the opponent were to lay a duffer tice with red,
          then it gives black a good chance to hit red and take off behind blue
          for a rush to H1 on turn 3. It is a leave that is generally only used
          by strong players who have a realistic chance of a third-turn break in
          the first place.
        




              Some common first-ball scenarios
            


Unusual first-turn options

          The croquet court is a big place and so there really are endless
          options for where to place balls in the opening. Often an unusual
          option first-turn will yield good results by confusing the opponent!
        
C4 first ball

          Not often seen these days due to a preference for an east boundary
          ball 10 yards further north. A weakness of this opening is that
          shooting at partner on turn 3 and missing is liable to leave a double
          target for yellow. It also generally encourages yellow to take an
          aggressive shot on turn 4; however on a difficult lawn this opening
          can have some advantages, with any hit by yellow on turn 4 at balls in
          C4 leaving little room to promote balls into the court due to the
          close proximity to the corner.
        
C2 first ball

          Playing blue into C2 first turn can often catch the opponent off
          guard. This opening attempts to flip the tables on red and yellow by
          trying to ensure a defensive opening for blue and black. This can be a
          good option where blue and black are the stronger players and want to
          prevent aggressive second-turn options by red and yellow. Of course,
          there are options available to red and yellow which negate blue and
          black's defensive preferences.
        
Micro tice

          As unusual options go, this is right up there. This option would not
          be recommended when playing a strong player, but nevertheless is very
          interesting. The micro tice is a ball played from the end of A baulk
          towards the east boundary, but only 2-3 yards towards it, leaving a
          2-3 yard roquet for the opponent on the second turn. This length of
          shot cannot really be refused, but leaving red a croquet stroke from
          south-west of hoop 4 on the second turn of the game gives no real
          break prospects. Often the second turn player will attempt an approach
          to H1 and fail it, leaving a 6-yard roquet with two balls near H1 for
          black. This opening relies more on a tactical mistake from red than
          anything else
        
C1 / C3 opening

          Occasionally seen. Not a good opening against any experienced
          opponent, but occasionally yields results. This first-turn option is
          not to be recommended. A first-turn ball in C1 followed by a
          second-turn response to C3 (or vice versa) is a killer blow to black's
          turn.

 Second
        Ball Options
      


          This is where things start to get a little interesting. For the most
          part, the opening is dictated by the second ball response, and there
          are many more options available.
        
Response to East Boundary ball
Standard Tice

          The standard tice is one of the most popular responses to an east
          boundary ball at club-level croquet. Although in recent years it has
          fallen out of favour with top players (likely due to an increase in
          the standard of shooting), it is still a great opening that gives good
          chances to both sides.
        

          The standard tice is where red is played to the west boundary, and the
          distance it is placed north of C1 needs to be carefully considered by
          the striker or red. The name "tice" indicates that the distance should
          be enticing for the player of black to shoot at and so a distance of
          between about 8 and 13 yards is common. As a general rule, if possible
          the distance chosen should either be about 1 yard longer than the
          opponent's critical distance (the distance at which someone hits 50%
          of their shots) or 1 yard shorter (or equal to) your own critical
          distance. Obviously this cannot be achieved if your opponent has a
          longer critical distance than you do, so it is better to err slightly
          on the longer side.
        

          If blue is an in-lawn east boundary ball, laying a standard tice is
          risky, as black can quite easily lay a rush directly to it on the
          third turn.
        
C2 ball

          Probably the most common response to the east boundary ball today is
          the second-turn ball to 6" south of C2. The reason for playing just
          south of C2 is that if in the unlikely event of black shooting at red
          on turn 3, a miss will likely leave yellow a double target. The idea
          of red near C2 means that red is buried in a defensive position, and
          signals yellow's intent to shoot at blue and black on turn 4.
        

          If blue is slightly in-lawn, then C2 is the safest and most defensive
          response with red.
        
Duffer tice

          One of the more aggressive responses for red is the duffer tice. This
          is a ball that is placed usually about 2-feet north and a few inches
          east of penultimate. This is similarly enticing for the opponent to
          shoot (just as with a standard tice) but in this case a miss is
          usually more critical - any third turn shot at the duffer is in the
          direction of A baulk so black usually takes the shot gently - and by
          doing so is more likely to miss. Black missing leaves two balls in the
          centre of the court, giving yellow a great chance on turn 4. The
          duffer tice is a great option for weaker players playing against
          stronger players, and also for anyone confident in hitting 10 yarders.
        

          Between two very strong players a duffer tice is still a popular
          opening. There are variations on the placement of the ball near
          penult, based on the strength of the opponent. It is common to see a
          duffer tice placed level with, or south of, H6, particularly if the
          striker of red and yellow is a very good shot and is confident to hit
          an 11-yarder on turn 4. In a game between experts, the placement of
          red is sometimes moved to the west of H6 to discourage a third-turn
          break after a hit from black at blue.
        
C4 ball

          This option is very popular in New Zealand and although a mirror image
          of the C2 ball, is a lot more aggressive. Placing red 6" north of C4
          not only gives negligible break prospects to black on turn 3 but also
          signals your intent to hit fourth-turn with yellow and have a break. A
          miss at partner by black on turn 3 gives you a 13-yard shot for a
          4-ball break, and a miss by black at red on turn 3 usually gives a
          double target.
        
Shoot at first-turn ball

          A slightly counter-intuitive option but nonetheless an interesting
          one. Shooting red at blue on turn 2 and hitting gives no break
          prospects, but a miss also leaves very slim break prospects for black
          on turn 3 if it hits, unless black is a very strong player. With this
          opening it is quite common to see misses on both turns 2 and 3, and
          often a triple target for yellow at the other 3 balls on turn 4 from B
          baulk.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to east boundary opening
            


Response to Supershot ball

          The supershot ball is the most aggressive opening that the first-turn
          player can use. There are several responses to this which need to be
          considered, based on your assessment of your opponent's ability and
          whether the opponent has realistic prospects of a break to 4-back if
          they do manage to hit 3rd turn.
        
C2 response

          The C2 response is a ball played about 6" south of C2. This is a
          strong response to a supershot against almost all players. If the
          player of black wants to attempt a third-turn break, they will have to
          hit a 13-yarder and play a very difficult croquet stroke out of C2 to
          get a rush to H1, and this is by no means guaranteed. On the other
          hand, a miss by black at red on turn 3 will leave yellow a double
          target and a 4-ball break if hit.
        




              It is important to finish a few inches south of C2 with red as it
              will mean black missing on either side of it will leave a double
              target. Above is a comparison of yellow's target after a
              third-turn miss by black at red, firstly with red in C2 and
              secondly with red a few inches south of C2
            



          There are only a handful of players in the world where the C2 ball is
          not a great response - players who would expect to hit the 13 yarder
          most of the time and also be good enough at croquet strokes to expect
          to get a rush to H1 on the supershot ball. Against these players the
          strategy of lengthing the 3rd turn shot would be preferred.
        
C4 response

          Mirror image to the C2 response, this ball is played 6" north of C4.
          Consider this if blue (the supershot ball) is placed further north
          than normal (somewhere near peg-high), or is in a particular spot
          which may have H4 obscuring any croquet stroke from C4 towards it. It
          otherwise gives all the same advantages as the C2 response
        
Max Distance response

          As a counter to the very top players hitting the ball in C2 most of
          the time, the max distance response became popular - this is where red
          is played to the east boundary about level with the peg on the east
          boundary, leaving the longest shot possible for black. This response
          grants black a shot from C3 through red and into C4, reducing yellow's
          fourth-turn prospects - it relies more on black missing red than
          trying to make any break pick-up by black more difficult. Generally a
          good option against the very best players, but against most players is
          unnecessary.  
The reason why max distance on the east boundary is chosen instead of the equivalent max distance spot on the west boundary is that it is slightly further from the supershot ball (blue), which is slightly south-west of the peg.  Assuming that the shots on turns 3 and 4 are missed, blue's shot at red & yellow on the east boundary will be a couple of yards longer than the equivalent shot to the west boundary.  
Supershot lag

          The response for red to lag to a spot 3-4 yards east and 1-2 yards
          north of the supershot ball is a very strong and very under-used
          response to the supershot. This is a good tactic when playing someone
          who is a very good shot, and in particular if the supershot ball
          itself is quite deep (nearer the peg than H5). Placing red beside blue
          nullifies the strength of black's shooting by encouraging black to
          take its third turn shot gently (which is generally less accurate), or
          risk shooting hard and missing into B baulk, conceding a 4-ball break.
          In this case, black may choose not to shoot at all, and instead also
          lag to a position wide of the other two balls, meaning that red and
          yellow have successfully turned the tables of the supershot opening
          and enabled yellow to have the first attempted roquet.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to supershot opening
            


Roquet the Supershot ball

          The ultimate way to nullify the supershot ball - roquet it on the
          second turn. After roqueting blue with red, there are several options
          available. You can croquet blue towards C2 and then fire red off 6"
          north of C4. A more aggressive option would be to croquet blue
          north-west of H2 and fire red off the south boundary, south of H4 -
          this leaves black a choice of 7-8 yarders but minimal break prospects
          and difficult strokes with their third turn in order to distance the
          balls from baulk. A more novel option would be to crosswire blue and
          red at the peg, which leaves only a 17-yard shot for black with a
          baulk line in the background. An even more interesting option might be
          to roll blue close to the peg, either east or west, and then play red
          a yard or two away from it, wiring blue's backswing at red. This means
          that black probably has no lag option towards blue that doesn't leave
          a double-target for yellow.
        
Response to unusual first-turn options
Response to a first-turn C2 ball

          A first-turn C2 ball is an attempt by blue to make red conform to a
          defensive opening. Red could of course do this if it wants, by playing
          6" north of C4, or even by just having a "standard" east boundary
          ball; however a better option to negate blue's attempt at dictating
          the opening might be to set a duffer tice - this is the ultimate
          aggressive response to the C2 ball, and means that black is suddenly
          faced with having to hit a 10-13 yarder on turn 3 or risk leaving the
          same for yellow next turn, and a laid break.
        
Back to top



 Third
        Ball Options
      

        For the vast majority of players, if they manage to hit in on the third
        turn of the game, they will and should be looking to make a dream leave
        (see top of page) or similar, possibly with red near the peg and blue &
        black with a rush towards it. There are exceptions to this line of play,
        mainly with supershot openings, but unless otherwise stated, the
        standard play would be to try and set a dream leave.
      

Response to WB tice after EB opening

          Realistically, black will not be attempting to make any break on turn
          3 if it manages to hit in. The player of black has to make a judgement
          call on their likelihood of hitting the standard tice vs their
          opponent's likelihood of missing it.
        


            If the tice is long, the best response is probably to shoot black at
            blue from A baulk. Missing black at blue leaves the free shot at the
            tice for yellow of course, which does give yellow fairly good
            prospects if hit. If the tice is extremely long, say peg-high, then
            black could quite feasibly just lag at blue and attempt to leave a
            rush to red. Bear in mind that playing this lag so early in the game
            may be difficult as you may not have the pace of the court - and
            there is a risk that lagging at blue and falling short will leave
            yellow a double target on turn 4.
          

            Another option if black is uncertain, would be to shoot at blue from
            C3, and missing through to C4. This hedges black's bets somewhat, as
            it is still taking a shot at a ball and still somewhat joining with
            partner ball, but does not give good break prospects to the opponent
            if yellow hits, due to the proximity of blue and black to one
            another. Yellow is faced with a long takeoff from red towards blue
            and black and in all likelihood will not get a rush to H1 from this
            position.
          

            The third option is of course to shoot at the tice itself. Hitting
            red will give the opportunity to make a dream leave (as shown at the
            top of the page). Missing red will send black towards C2, which will
            give black a free shot back through red and yellow if yellow misses
            its fourth-turn shot at red.
          





              Some common third-ball responses to a standard tice
            


Response to C2 ball after EB opening

          There are two common options after a second-turn C2 ball - both
          consist of shooting at partner. If partner is hit, then usually the
          play will be to take off to the red in C2, roquet it and then croquet
          it either into the centre of the court, or along the west boundary,
          then lag back to partner and leave a rush in-court. However, consider
          a game where you are the stronger player playing a very capable weaker
          player, if you do hit partner third turn, you can elect to just set a
          rush to the C2 ball instead of trying to retrieve it from C2. As the
          stronger player you may prefer this line of play, instead of digging
          out the C2 ball only for your opponent to hit on turn 4 and have an
          easy break.
        

          Usually the third-turn shot at partner with black will be from A
          baulk, joining up on the east boundary if missed. This leaves a long
          double target for yellow from the end of B baulk. A more defensive
          play would be to shoot at partner from C3 into C4. Doing this leaves
          almost no break prospects fourth-turn for yellow but, depending on the
          distance between blue and black, may give them the opportunity to join
          up.
        

          Another option for black on turn 3 would be to shoot at red in C2 -
          however usually this is only a viable option if red is exactly in the
          corner, as it will mean that missing red on the right leaves no double
          target for yellow. Alternatively, another option would be for black to
          join up with red near C2, about 3-4 feet south of it. Doing so leaves
          no double target from B baulk and gives good break prospects to black
          if yellow misses the 13 yarder, although it must be remembered that
          yellow also has good prospects if it hits the 13 yarder. Black joining
          up with red also leaves a defensive shot for yellow at blue from C3 to
          C4 which, if missed, leaves black a very long and tricky takeoff from
          C2 to the east boundary.

Response to C2 / C4 ball after Supershot opening

          The third-turn response to this option depends greatly on your ability
          and also the ability of your opponent. Before you lay the supershot,
          you need to ask yourself "am I realistically good enough to play a
          third-turn break to 4-back?". If the answer is no, then that does not
          mean that the supershot opening is a bad idea at all, but it just
          means that you may want to reassess your third-turn response.
          Additionally, if you are playing someone that you believe is much
          better than you are, then trying to give yourself a 4-ball break on
          turn 5 is exactly what you should be trying to achieve. Therefore,
          instead of trying to roquet the 13 yard shot of black at red just
          south of C2 (or just north of C4), you can instead look to join up
          with the ball 3-4 feet away, ensuring to leave no double target. This
          puts a great deal of pressure on your stronger opponent to then hit a
          13 yarder or else concede a 4-ball break to you.
        

          If you believe you are good enough to hit on turn 3 and play a break,
          then the answer is simple - hit red near C2 and go round.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / C2 ball
            


Response to EB ball after Supershot opening

          In most cases, the third-turn response to a max distance ball is to
          try and hit it from C3, missing into C4. Again, however, you should
          evaluate your own likelihood of playing a break to 4-back with only 3
          balls on the lawn if you hit, and so you may want to consider lagging
          to the ball, a couple of yards in-lawn from the east boundary.
        

          If the ball on the east boundary is south of the peg, it is tempting
          to simply shoot at it from A baulk. Missing will of course leave a
          double from B baulk, but the odds of yellow then hitting a double
          target from 20+ yards is no certainty. Alternatively, if the
          second-turn ball is around peg-high, then shooting at it from B baulk
          from a few yards west of C3 and missing often results in a fairly even
          spread of the balls, with your black ball being approximately 8 yards
          south of red and 8 yards north of C4. This again is technically a
          double target from somewhere on B Baulk, but given the distance
          between red and black, is easily missed and will leave your black ball
          a shot of only 8 yards.

              ball
            


Response to C4 ball after EB opening

          This opening creates one of the more interesting third-turn decisions.
          A second-turn ball 6" north of C4 is a very threatening position and
          therefore the options will as follows:
        


            Shoot at partner
            
Hit - set a dream leave

                Miss - leaves yellow a 13-yard shot at red in C4 for a 4-ball
                break
              



            Shoot at opponent near C4 from A baulk
            

                Hit - set a dream leave (you may want to have a go at gaining a
                rush to H1 on partner)
              

                Miss - leave a 13-yard double for yellow (but slightly tricky
                break pick-up)
              



            Join up with opponent near C4, leaving no double
            

                If red is 3-6" north of C4 - join a yard north of it from A
                baulk
                
No short double target is left for yellow

                    Yellow still only has a 13-yard shot for the innings (but a
                    slightly tricky break pick-up)
                  



                If red is ~12" north of C4 - shoot from C3 through to C4
                

                    Enables black to have a shot (albeit very long) to attempt
                    to hit and set a dream leave
                  




Black to C2


              By burying itself in C2, this enables black to kill off the
              aggression by red and yellow. Any miss by yellow will leave a 9
              yarder (at most) for blue
            






              Some common third-ball responses to a C4 ball
            



          A personal preference of mine is to shoot third-turn at the ball near
          C4 from A baulk, because hitting gives me control of the court, and I
          miss often enough by more than several inches so as not to leave a
          double.
        

          Be on the lookout for cannons around C4 as part of this opening -
          there is often a good opportunity to bombard a live ball across to H1
          while playing a croquet stroke towards blue on the east boundary. This
          can make picking up the first break a great deal easier.
        
Response to duffer tice after EB opening

          The duffer tice is one of my favourite openings. Because of the
          placement of red near H6, a miss by black from the end of B baulk will
          be headed towards A baulk and give an easy start for yellow. That is
          why we see the ~9 yard shot at red refused so often, even by very
          strong players!
        

          If black does decide to shoot at the duffer and hits, then not a great
          deal of options are available other than to take off to partner ball
          (usually nudging red towards the peg in the process), and leave a rush
          towards red, and then hope for a fourth-turn miss by yellow.
        

          Another option for shooting at the duffer is doing so from C3,
          shooting across the court and missing to around peg-high (or just
          south of peg-high) on the west boundary. This is the most defensive
          shot available in that a miss gives no break to yellow if yellow hits
          red, but it also does not put any pressure on yellow's shot at red.
          Often times, when black misses the shot from C3 at red, it will end up
          south of peg-high on the west boundary and be a tempting free shot for
          yellow from C1.
        

          Shooting at partner ball on turn 3 is the most aggressive line of play
          - taking the shot from A baulk and hitting gives the opportunity to
          play a big croquet stroke loading partner to H2 and attempting to get
          a rush to H1 on the duffer ball - it is a big shot and the break
          chances are normally only reasonable for very strong players. Missing
          partner from A baulk on the other hand gives yellow a ~9 yard shot and
          very strong break prospects. It is therefore more usual to see black
          shoot at blue from C3 which, although longer, doesn't make all the
          balls available to yellow if black misses blue and yellow hits red. It
          also means that blue and black maintain a wide join and have realistic
          prospects of hitting back in if yellow misses red.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a duffer tice
            


Response to 2 balls on EB

          If red has shot at blue on turn 2 and missed, leaving both balls on
          the east boundary, you should carefully evaluate your response based
          on the strength of your opponent. If you and your opponent are evenly
          matched but not world class players, or especially if your opponent is
          a much stronger player than you, then the best thing to do here may be
          to simply ignore the two balls on the east boundary and lag black into
          the middle of the court and wait for yellow to miss. This potentially
          presents you with an immediate break with a ball in the middle of the
          court.
        

          In a match between two very strong players it would be unusual to see
          no shot taken on turn 3, and if hit, some attempt at digging out a
          3-ball break.
        
Response to 2 balls in-court

          In a situation where you have laid a supershot with blue, and red has
          lagged a couple of yards north east of your supershot ball, if there
          is no double target to be had from anywhere on the baulk lines, you
          must again consider your expectations after hitting third turn vs your
          opponent's likelihood of hitting fourth turn. As with previous
          options, if you are playing an opponent who on paper is a much
          stronger player, the percentage play is usually to lag the black ball
          into the middle of the court beside the other two balls (being mindful
          not to leave a double target from anywhere), which will put pressure
          on your stronger opponent to hit in or else concede the first break
          opportunity to you.
        

          If you do want to shoot with black at one of the balls in the middle,
          then consider either shooting at the easterly ball from C1 (you may
          even be able to shoot hard at this without missing to B baulk), or
          alternatively shooting at a medium pace at either blue or red from the
          closest point on A baulk. If you do shoot from the closest point, be
          sure to hit at a pace to finish slightly south of H6, both so that
          black is not a short shot from B baulk, and so that any double target
          that you leave has plenty of space between the front and back ball.
        

          If you are facing a third turn shot with black after red has
          cross-wired blue and red at the peg, check first to see if there is a
          point which you can lag to where blue won't be wired from black, and
          which won't be giving a double target from either baulk line - if
          there is such a spot, then that is the best place to lag to.

 Fourth Ball Options
      

The fourth-turn response is usually actually more simple than then third-turn response - although there are more possible scenarios, they almost always result in yellow trying to roquet something.  
      

Response to ignored WB tice
When black has ignored a standard west boundary tice and insetad shot at (and missed) partner on the east boundary, the obvious response is to then try and hit red yourself from C1.  If the placement of red is good, you should have ~50% chance of hitting in.  Your break prospects after hitting red are actually quite good, as you will play a take off from red to blue & black, which will automatically be sending red towards H2 as a pioneer.  On the other hand, a miss with yellow through red into C2 only gives fairly mediocre break prospects to blue & black in the next turn.
Response to missed WB tice
If black did indeed shoot at red (and miss) from C1 in the previous turn, then the obvious response is to shoot at red yourself, but from a point east of C1 so that a miss will leave yellow joined with red.  If you hit red, your best line of play would be to roll red &  yellow towards C1 and lay a rush for your next turn.  A miss from red at yellow will of course leave black a shot through red and yellow from C2 to C1 but is likely to be a very long shot at a single ball target.  A miss from black on turn 5 here also gives you a good chance at establishing a break on turn 5.  




              If black has missed the standard tice, it leaves a good opportunity to join up with red on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C2 ball after EB opening
Having played red into C2 on turn 2, if black ignores red and simply joins with blue (which is likely), then against most players your best line of play would be to shoot at blue and black with red.  Whether you shoot from A baulk or B baulk depends on factors such as the distance between blue and black (whether it is easy to make a double target from B baulk or A baulk) and the flatness of the east boundary.  If the black ball missed blue badly on the left on turn 3, blue and black may well be 2+ yards apart on the east boundary, so there is a defensive option available to yellow as well - shoot from C3 through to C4, where a miss would not give blue & black any easy opening.
If you are the weaker player against a very strong opponent, then there is a case for shooting yellow at red - at 13 yards, it is significantly shorter than any other available shot and is therefore your best chance at winning the opening.  Red missing yellow gives blue a relatively easy start and a probable break, but against a very strong opponent it can still be worth the risk.  




              Fourth-turn responses for yellow when partner is in C2 and opponent balls are on the east boundary.  
            


Response to joined / missed C2 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, if black has for some reason shot at red in C2, then assuming a double target has been left, your best aggressive option is to shoot at this, preferably hitting the northern ball, from B baulk.  A hit or a miss here will give fairly good break prospects to whomever plays the next shot, given C2's proximity to H2 - a semi-good pioneer can usually be sent to H2 while obtaining a rush to H1.
If black has instead joined up a yard south of red on turn 2, you have no double target (except from C1, but let's not consider that).  Now you have fundamentally two options - either shoot yellow at red which will give a good break opportunity if hit (and concede a good break opportunity to black if missed), or take a more defensive line by shooting yellow at blue from C3 into C4.  If yellow misses this shot, it does give black a 1-yard roquet at red for the innings, however it not only gives no break prospects, but also requires black to play several good strokes in order to have a good leave.  Black's take off from C2 to blue on the east boundary is a difficult shot, and if black doesn't succeed in roqueting blue in its next shot (either taking off short and missing blue, or taking off too far and sending black out) then yellow will have a 9-10 yard shot at blue & black from near C4.




              If black has joined a yard south of red near C2, the yellow has aggressive and defensive options available
            


Response to missed EB ball after Supershot opening
The response here depends a lot on both the length of the supershot ball and what option black chose on turn 3.  Firstly let's assume the most common scenario, with blue halfway between H5 and peg, and 1-2 yards west of the centre line, and red approximately peg high on the EB, and black in or near C4.  In this situation the best option is normally to shoot at red from A baulk, with a miss joining up around 1 yard north of it.  This leaves blue a 15-yarder at red & yellow but difficult break prospects for both players, whomever plays the next shot. 




              The common response after a third-turn miss by black at red to C4, is for yellow to shoot at red, joining if missing.  An aggressive line is to shoot at black.  A third option is yellow at blue, which is shorter and will win you the innings, but only gives good break prospects if red and black are near to each other
            


As the weaker player against a stronger player, a very aggressive line of play would be to shoot yellow from A baulk at black in C4 - this is very black and white, as a hit will give you a good chance for a 4-ball break and a miss will give black the same chance.  As the weaker player, you can strongly consider this option.  
Consider for a moment that black's third-turn shot missed red from A baulk, or perhaps missed red from west of C3, finishing 5-10 yards south of red.  In this case, yellow for look for possible double targets available from B baulk.  Consider, too, the shortest shot available, which is yellow at blue from A baulk - this is likely a 11-13 yard shot which, if hit, gives good break prospects to yellow because red and black are close together.
Response to ignored duffer tice
The vast majority of the time the best response to black ignoring red's duffer tice, is for yellow to shoot hard at red from B baulk.  Usually a duffer tice is only 9-10 yards and so it will be, by far, the shortest shot for yellow.




              The majority of the time, the fourth turn response would be to shoot yellow at the duffer.  Against a very strong player, you might be tempted by yellow at black in C4 which, although 3 yards longer, gives an easy start to your break
            


An expection to this would be if blue & black are joined on the east boundary leaving a good double target from A baulk, and so you may want to consider shooting at that instead.  Another option to consider is if black shot and missed blue from C3 to C4.  If you are playing against a much stronger opponent you may consider shooting yellow at black from A baulk into C4.  This shot is 3 yards longer than yellow at red from B baulk, but hitting this shot gives you vastly stronger break prospects than if you hit red first.
Response to missed duffer tice
If black misses the duffer tice (red) gently, the logical response is to shoot hard at either red from B baulk or black from A baulk (whichever is closer).  If black misses the duffer tice from C3 across to the west boundary, you may consider shooting at black from C1 through to C2, particularly if black is south of peg-high.  




              If the duffer tice is still in its original position at the start of turn 4, the general response is for yellow to shoot at red given its proximity to B baulk.  If black missed red from C3 however, it can be tempting to shoot at black from C1 on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C4 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, red a few inches north of C4 and black 1 yard north of blue, yellow's default response should be to shoot at red from A baulk.  Hitting this shot gives a great break opportunity, as it is a very natural stroke to croquet red to H2 while approaching blue & black up the east boundary.  
Response to 3 balls on EB
In this instance, you simply need to hit one of the balls on the east boundary - from either A baulk or B baulk, depending on length and available targets.
Response to 3 balls in-court
A supershot opening with lags by red and black essentially forces yellow to shoot at the closest ball.  A very black and white opening, good break prospects for both players on turn 4 or 5, depending on whether yellow hits or misses.  Often times, black will have take a gentle lag while attempting a roquet at either blue or red on turn 3, so this may also give yellow some target to shoot at on turn 4.

Conclusion
If you have gotten to the bottom of this article, you have probably realised by now that the number of opening options are vast.  This article could not hope to cover every eventuality, and nor does it present any new or unseen openings; rather it serves to talk through the options and thought processes for choosing a particular option, and I hope it has been useful.

Openings

        The opening is the battle between the two sides to be the first to gain
        the upper hand. Generally when we talk about openings in croquet, we are
        referring to the first 4 turns. At the very top level it is where games
        are won and lost, but at all levels it provides a fascinating array of
        options for bluffing and double-bluffing your opponent.
      
Opening priorities
As the stronger player

        The stronger player who is playing a dangerous but less experienced /
        weaker player will generally approach the opening with the intent of not
        giving away an easy break, and hence a more defensive mindset. Openings
        where there is a lot of grey area, balls on boundaries and in corners
        are best for this. The stronger player will generally rely on their
        better all-round game in order to win, and is more comfortable with
        digging balls out slowly into a break.
      
As the weaker player

        The weaker player should approach a game against a much stronger
        opponent with an attacking mindset - they will not be afraid to take on
        relatively short shots that give laid breaks, even if it means conceding
        a laid break if they miss. The weaker player should favour openings that
        have balls in-lawn and should be looking to put pressure on the stronger
        player to have to hit in.
      
Evenly-matched players

        It is quite common to see very aggressive, black and white, openings
        when two very strong players play against each other. The same is true
        for openings between evenly-matched players at lower levels, but
        generally to a lesser extent. A lot of the opening strategy depends on
        the individual mindset of the player, with some players naturally
        playing a more attacking game than others.
      

        Below are articles on various well-known (and some not-so-well-known)
        openings, which discuss options for placement of balls, and responses to
        them. For the purposes of simplicity, in the examples below, the balls
        will always be played in the following order:
      


 Blue
        

 Red
        


          Black
        


          Yellow
        


Note: there is no ball order or sequence in which the balls need to
          be added to the game in croquet - the above order is simply to keep
          things consistent for the diagrams and explanations.


        As you can probably imagine, the options in the opening are endless.
        This article attempts to talk through some of the most common options,
        and some of the most common responses to them, with the idea of
        clarifying some of the thought processes behind them.
      

The Dream Leave

        Many of the openings below will reference something known as the Dream
        Leave - this is a scenario where the third turn ball (black) has hit and
        arranged the court as follows:
      




            Black hit on turn 3 and set a dream leave
          



        Black has retrieved red from wherever it was on the court and placed it
        slightly in-lawn from the west boundary, north of peg-high, and left
        blue a rush to it from the east boundary. This leave gives no short shot
        for yellow, and any miss by yellow will give blue a good break
        opportunity.

 First
        Ball Options
      

East Boundary

          The most common option selected by the first ball player. A ball to
          the east boundary, somewhere between level with H4 and H5, is chosen
          due to its relative distance from both baulk lines and from H1. It is
          a completely non-threatening ball and allows the second ball player to
          dictate the nature of the game, be it defensive or aggressive.
        
In-lawn East Boundary ball

          A variation on the standard east boundary ball, the in-lawn east
          boundary ball is struck out in the same area as the standard east
          boundary ball, but purposefully left about 1 yard in from the yardline
          area. The idea behind that is so that black can play its third turn
          shot out behind blue and leave itself a rush in-court. This play
          discourages responses like a west boundary tice from red.
        
Supershot

          A supershot ball is a first-turn ball placed near the middle of the
          court, normally between H5 and peg and a couple of yards west of the
          centre line. This is the most aggressive sensible option for the first
          ball, and signals your intent to your opponent that you want no grey
          area. Given its proximity to H1, a supershot ball generally gives a
          good chance for a break for either player, depending on whether the
          third-turn, fourth-turn or fifth-turn shots are hit.
        

          There are variations on the length of the supershot, with a supershot
          played to near the peg being a poorer pioneer for H1 but having the
          advantage of lengthening any fourth-turn shot by yellow at it.
        
Anti-duffer

          This opening is an attempt to try and pre-empt the second-turn
          response and discourage a "duffer tice" by red. To lay an anti-duffer,
          you hit blue to a spot somewhere between H6 and the peg, and 1-2 yards
          west of the east boundary. The idea of placing a ball here is that if
          the opponent were to lay a duffer tice with red,
          then it gives black a good chance to hit red and take off behind blue
          for a rush to H1 on turn 3. It is a leave that is generally only used
          by strong players who have a realistic chance of a third-turn break in
          the first place.
        




              Some common first-ball scenarios
            


Unusual first-turn options

          The croquet court is a big place and so there really are endless
          options for where to place balls in the opening. Often an unusual
          option first-turn will yield good results by confusing the opponent!
        
C4 first ball

          Not often seen these days due to a preference for an east boundary
          ball 10 yards further north. A weakness of this opening is that
          shooting at partner on turn 3 and missing is liable to leave a double
          target for yellow. It also generally encourages yellow to take an
          aggressive shot on turn 4; however on a difficult lawn this opening
          can have some advantages, with any hit by yellow on turn 4 at balls in
          C4 leaving little room to promote balls into the court due to the
          close proximity to the corner.
        
C2 first ball

          Playing blue into C2 first turn can often catch the opponent off
          guard. This opening attempts to flip the tables on red and yellow by
          trying to ensure a defensive opening for blue and black. This can be a
          good option where blue and black are the stronger players and want to
          prevent aggressive second-turn options by red and yellow. Of course,
          there are options available to red and yellow which negate blue and
          black's defensive preferences.
        
Micro tice

          As unusual options go, this is right up there. This option would not
          be recommended when playing a strong player, but nevertheless is very
          interesting. The micro tice is a ball played from the end of A baulk
          towards the east boundary, but only 2-3 yards towards it, leaving a
          2-3 yard roquet for the opponent on the second turn. This length of
          shot cannot really be refused, but leaving red a croquet stroke from
          south-west of hoop 4 on the second turn of the game gives no real
          break prospects. Often the second turn player will attempt an approach
          to H1 and fail it, leaving a 6-yard roquet with two balls near H1 for
          black. This opening relies more on a tactical mistake from red than
          anything else
        
C1 / C3 opening

          Occasionally seen. Not a good opening against any experienced
          opponent, but occasionally yields results. This first-turn option is
          not to be recommended. A first-turn ball in C1 followed by a
          second-turn response to C3 (or vice versa) is a killer blow to black's
          turn.

 Second
        Ball Options
      


          This is where things start to get a little interesting. For the most
          part, the opening is dictated by the second ball response, and there
          are many more options available.
        
Response to East Boundary ball
Standard Tice

          The standard tice is one of the most popular responses to an east
          boundary ball at club-level croquet. Although in recent years it has
          fallen out of favour with top players (likely due to an increase in
          the standard of shooting), it is still a great opening that gives good
          chances to both sides.
        

          The standard tice is where red is played to the west boundary, and the
          distance it is placed north of C1 needs to be carefully considered by
          the striker or red. The name "tice" indicates that the distance should
          be enticing for the player of black to shoot at and so a distance of
          between about 8 and 13 yards is common. As a general rule, if possible
          the distance chosen should either be about 1 yard longer than the
          opponent's critical distance (the distance at which someone hits 50%
          of their shots) or 1 yard shorter (or equal to) your own critical
          distance. Obviously this cannot be achieved if your opponent has a
          longer critical distance than you do, so it is better to err slightly
          on the longer side.
        

          If blue is an in-lawn east boundary ball, laying a standard tice is
          risky, as black can quite easily lay a rush directly to it on the
          third turn.
        
C2 ball

          Probably the most common response to the east boundary ball today is
          the second-turn ball to 6" south of C2. The reason for playing just
          south of C2 is that if in the unlikely event of black shooting at red
          on turn 3, a miss will likely leave yellow a double target. The idea
          of red near C2 means that red is buried in a defensive position, and
          signals yellow's intent to shoot at blue and black on turn 4.
        

          If blue is slightly in-lawn, then C2 is the safest and most defensive
          response with red.
        
Duffer tice

          One of the more aggressive responses for red is the duffer tice. This
          is a ball that is placed usually about 2-feet north and a few inches
          east of penultimate. This is similarly enticing for the opponent to
          shoot (just as with a standard tice) but in this case a miss is
          usually more critical - any third turn shot at the duffer is in the
          direction of A baulk so black usually takes the shot gently - and by
          doing so is more likely to miss. Black missing leaves two balls in the
          centre of the court, giving yellow a great chance on turn 4. The
          duffer tice is a great option for weaker players playing against
          stronger players, and also for anyone confident in hitting 10 yarders.
        

          Between two very strong players a duffer tice is still a popular
          opening. There are variations on the placement of the ball near
          penult, based on the strength of the opponent. It is common to see a
          duffer tice placed level with, or south of, H6, particularly if the
          striker of red and yellow is a very good shot and is confident to hit
          an 11-yarder on turn 4. In a game between experts, the placement of
          red is sometimes moved to the west of H6 to discourage a third-turn
          break after a hit from black at blue.
        
C4 ball

          This option is very popular in New Zealand and although a mirror image
          of the C2 ball, is a lot more aggressive. Placing red 6" north of C4
          not only gives negligible break prospects to black on turn 3 but also
          signals your intent to hit fourth-turn with yellow and have a break. A
          miss at partner by black on turn 3 gives you a 13-yard shot for a
          4-ball break, and a miss by black at red on turn 3 usually gives a
          double target.
        
Shoot at first-turn ball

          A slightly counter-intuitive option but nonetheless an interesting
          one. Shooting red at blue on turn 2 and hitting gives no break
          prospects, but a miss also leaves very slim break prospects for black
          on turn 3 if it hits, unless black is a very strong player. With this
          opening it is quite common to see misses on both turns 2 and 3, and
          often a triple target for yellow at the other 3 balls on turn 4 from B
          baulk.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to east boundary opening
            


Response to Supershot ball

          The supershot ball is the most aggressive opening that the first-turn
          player can use. There are several responses to this which need to be
          considered, based on your assessment of your opponent's ability and
          whether the opponent has realistic prospects of a break to 4-back if
          they do manage to hit 3rd turn.
        
C2 response

          The C2 response is a ball played about 6" south of C2. This is a
          strong response to a supershot against almost all players. If the
          player of black wants to attempt a third-turn break, they will have to
          hit a 13-yarder and play a very difficult croquet stroke out of C2 to
          get a rush to H1, and this is by no means guaranteed. On the other
          hand, a miss by black at red on turn 3 will leave yellow a double
          target and a 4-ball break if hit.
        




              It is important to finish a few inches south of C2 with red as it
              will mean black missing on either side of it will leave a double
              target. Above is a comparison of yellow's target after a
              third-turn miss by black at red, firstly with red in C2 and
              secondly with red a few inches south of C2
            



          There are only a handful of players in the world where the C2 ball is
          not a great response - players who would expect to hit the 13 yarder
          most of the time and also be good enough at croquet strokes to expect
          to get a rush to H1 on the supershot ball. Against these players the
          strategy of lengthing the 3rd turn shot would be preferred.
        
C4 response

          Mirror image to the C2 response, this ball is played 6" north of C4.
          Consider this if blue (the supershot ball) is placed further north
          than normal (somewhere near peg-high), or is in a particular spot
          which may have H4 obscuring any croquet stroke from C4 towards it. It
          otherwise gives all the same advantages as the C2 response
        
Max Distance response

          As a counter to the very top players hitting the ball in C2 most of
          the time, the max distance response became popular - this is where red
          is played to the east boundary about level with the peg on the east
          boundary, leaving the longest shot possible for black. This response
          grants black a shot from C3 through red and into C4, reducing yellow's
          fourth-turn prospects - it relies more on black missing red than
          trying to make any break pick-up by black more difficult. Generally a
          good option against the very best players, but against most players is
          unnecessary.  
The reason why max distance on the east boundary is chosen instead of the equivalent max distance spot on the west boundary is that it is slightly further from the supershot ball (blue), which is slightly south-west of the peg.  Assuming that the shots on turns 3 and 4 are missed, blue's shot at red & yellow on the east boundary will be a couple of yards longer than the equivalent shot to the west boundary.  
Supershot lag

          The response for red to lag to a spot 3-4 yards east and 1-2 yards
          north of the supershot ball is a very strong and very under-used
          response to the supershot. This is a good tactic when playing someone
          who is a very good shot, and in particular if the supershot ball
          itself is quite deep (nearer the peg than H5). Placing red beside blue
          nullifies the strength of black's shooting by encouraging black to
          take its third turn shot gently (which is generally less accurate), or
          risk shooting hard and missing into B baulk, conceding a 4-ball break.
          In this case, black may choose not to shoot at all, and instead also
          lag to a position wide of the other two balls, meaning that red and
          yellow have successfully turned the tables of the supershot opening
          and enabled yellow to have the first attempted roquet.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to supershot opening
            


Roquet the Supershot ball

          The ultimate way to nullify the supershot ball - roquet it on the
          second turn. After roqueting blue with red, there are several options
          available. You can croquet blue towards C2 and then fire red off 6"
          north of C4. A more aggressive option would be to croquet blue
          north-west of H2 and fire red off the south boundary, south of H4 -
          this leaves black a choice of 7-8 yarders but minimal break prospects
          and difficult strokes with their third turn in order to distance the
          balls from baulk. A more novel option would be to crosswire blue and
          red at the peg, which leaves only a 17-yard shot for black with a
          baulk line in the background. An even more interesting option might be
          to roll blue close to the peg, either east or west, and then play red
          a yard or two away from it, wiring blue's backswing at red. This means
          that black probably has no lag option towards blue that doesn't leave
          a double-target for yellow.
        
Response to unusual first-turn options
Response to a first-turn C2 ball

          A first-turn C2 ball is an attempt by blue to make red conform to a
          defensive opening. Red could of course do this if it wants, by playing
          6" north of C4, or even by just having a "standard" east boundary
          ball; however a better option to negate blue's attempt at dictating
          the opening might be to set a duffer tice - this is the ultimate
          aggressive response to the C2 ball, and means that black is suddenly
          faced with having to hit a 10-13 yarder on turn 3 or risk leaving the
          same for yellow next turn, and a laid break.
        
Back to top



 Third
        Ball Options
      

        For the vast majority of players, if they manage to hit in on the third
        turn of the game, they will and should be looking to make a dream leave
        (see top of page) or similar, possibly with red near the peg and blue &
        black with a rush towards it. There are exceptions to this line of play,
        mainly with supershot openings, but unless otherwise stated, the
        standard play would be to try and set a dream leave.
      

Response to WB tice after EB opening

          Realistically, black will not be attempting to make any break on turn
          3 if it manages to hit in. The player of black has to make a judgement
          call on their likelihood of hitting the standard tice vs their
          opponent's likelihood of missing it.
        


            If the tice is long, the best response is probably to shoot black at
            blue from A baulk. Missing black at blue leaves the free shot at the
            tice for yellow of course, which does give yellow fairly good
            prospects if hit. If the tice is extremely long, say peg-high, then
            black could quite feasibly just lag at blue and attempt to leave a
            rush to red. Bear in mind that playing this lag so early in the game
            may be difficult as you may not have the pace of the court - and
            there is a risk that lagging at blue and falling short will leave
            yellow a double target on turn 4.
          

            Another option if black is uncertain, would be to shoot at blue from
            C3, and missing through to C4. This hedges black's bets somewhat, as
            it is still taking a shot at a ball and still somewhat joining with
            partner ball, but does not give good break prospects to the opponent
            if yellow hits, due to the proximity of blue and black to one
            another. Yellow is faced with a long takeoff from red towards blue
            and black and in all likelihood will not get a rush to H1 from this
            position.
          

            The third option is of course to shoot at the tice itself. Hitting
            red will give the opportunity to make a dream leave (as shown at the
            top of the page). Missing red will send black towards C2, which will
            give black a free shot back through red and yellow if yellow misses
            its fourth-turn shot at red.
          





              Some common third-ball responses to a standard tice
            


Response to C2 ball after EB opening

          There are two common options after a second-turn C2 ball - both
          consist of shooting at partner. If partner is hit, then usually the
          play will be to take off to the red in C2, roquet it and then croquet
          it either into the centre of the court, or along the west boundary,
          then lag back to partner and leave a rush in-court. However, consider
          a game where you are the stronger player playing a very capable weaker
          player, if you do hit partner third turn, you can elect to just set a
          rush to the C2 ball instead of trying to retrieve it from C2. As the
          stronger player you may prefer this line of play, instead of digging
          out the C2 ball only for your opponent to hit on turn 4 and have an
          easy break.
        

          Usually the third-turn shot at partner with black will be from A
          baulk, joining up on the east boundary if missed. This leaves a long
          double target for yellow from the end of B baulk. A more defensive
          play would be to shoot at partner from C3 into C4. Doing this leaves
          almost no break prospects fourth-turn for yellow but, depending on the
          distance between blue and black, may give them the opportunity to join
          up.
        

          Another option for black on turn 3 would be to shoot at red in C2 -
          however usually this is only a viable option if red is exactly in the
          corner, as it will mean that missing red on the right leaves no double
          target for yellow. Alternatively, another option would be for black to
          join up with red near C2, about 3-4 feet south of it. Doing so leaves
          no double target from B baulk and gives good break prospects to black
          if yellow misses the 13 yarder, although it must be remembered that
          yellow also has good prospects if it hits the 13 yarder. Black joining
          up with red also leaves a defensive shot for yellow at blue from C3 to
          C4 which, if missed, leaves black a very long and tricky takeoff from
          C2 to the east boundary.

Response to C2 / C4 ball after Supershot opening

          The third-turn response to this option depends greatly on your ability
          and also the ability of your opponent. Before you lay the supershot,
          you need to ask yourself "am I realistically good enough to play a
          third-turn break to 4-back?". If the answer is no, then that does not
          mean that the supershot opening is a bad idea at all, but it just
          means that you may want to reassess your third-turn response.
          Additionally, if you are playing someone that you believe is much
          better than you are, then trying to give yourself a 4-ball break on
          turn 5 is exactly what you should be trying to achieve. Therefore,
          instead of trying to roquet the 13 yard shot of black at red just
          south of C2 (or just north of C4), you can instead look to join up
          with the ball 3-4 feet away, ensuring to leave no double target. This
          puts a great deal of pressure on your stronger opponent to then hit a
          13 yarder or else concede a 4-ball break to you.
        

          If you believe you are good enough to hit on turn 3 and play a break,
          then the answer is simple - hit red near C2 and go round.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / C2 ball
            


Response to EB ball after Supershot opening

          In most cases, the third-turn response to a max distance ball is to
          try and hit it from C3, missing into C4. Again, however, you should
          evaluate your own likelihood of playing a break to 4-back with only 3
          balls on the lawn if you hit, and so you may want to consider lagging
          to the ball, a couple of yards in-lawn from the east boundary.
        

          If the ball on the east boundary is south of the peg, it is tempting
          to simply shoot at it from A baulk. Missing will of course leave a
          double from B baulk, but the odds of yellow then hitting a double
          target from 20+ yards is no certainty. Alternatively, if the
          second-turn ball is around peg-high, then shooting at it from B baulk
          from a few yards west of C3 and missing often results in a fairly even
          spread of the balls, with your black ball being approximately 8 yards
          south of red and 8 yards north of C4. This again is technically a
          double target from somewhere on B Baulk, but given the distance
          between red and black, is easily missed and will leave your black ball
          a shot of only 8 yards.

Response to C4 ball after EB opening

          This opening creates one of the more interesting third-turn decisions.
          A second-turn ball 6" north of C4 is a very threatening position and
          therefore the options will as follows:
        


            Shoot at partner
            
Hit - set a dream leave

                Miss - leaves yellow a 13-yard shot at red in C4 for a 4-ball
                break
              



            Shoot at opponent near C4 from A baulk
            

                Hit - set a dream leave (you may want to have a go at gaining a
                rush to H1 on partner)
              

                Miss - leave a 13-yard double for yellow (but slightly tricky
                break pick-up)
              



            Join up with opponent near C4, leaving no double
            

                If red is 3-6" north of C4 - join a yard north of it from A
                baulk
                
No short double target is left for yellow

                    Yellow still only has a 13-yard shot for the innings (but a
                    slightly tricky break pick-up)
                  



                If red is ~12" north of C4 - shoot from C3 through to C4
                

                    Enables black to have a shot (albeit very long) to attempt
                    to hit and set a dream leave
                  




Black to C2


              By burying itself in C2, this enables black to kill off the
              aggression by red and yellow. Any miss by yellow will leave a 9
              yarder (at most) for blue
            






              Some common third-ball responses to a C4 ball
            



          A personal preference of mine is to shoot third-turn at the ball near
          C4 from A baulk, because hitting gives me control of the court, and I
          miss often enough by more than several inches so as not to leave a
          double.
        

          Be on the lookout for cannons around C4 as part of this opening -
          there is often a good opportunity to bombard a live ball across to H1
          while playing a croquet stroke towards blue on the east boundary. This
          can make picking up the first break a great deal easier.
        
Response to duffer tice after EB opening

          The duffer tice is one of my favourite openings. Because of the
          placement of red near H6, a miss by black from the end of B baulk will
          be headed towards A baulk and give an easy start for yellow. That is
          why we see the ~9 yard shot at red refused so often, even by very
          strong players!
        

          If black does decide to shoot at the duffer and hits, then not a great
          deal of options are available other than to take off to partner ball
          (usually nudging red towards the peg in the process), and leave a rush
          towards red, and then hope for a fourth-turn miss by yellow.
        

          Another option for shooting at the duffer is doing so from C3,
          shooting across the court and missing to around peg-high (or just
          south of peg-high) on the west boundary. This is the most defensive
          shot available in that a miss gives no break to yellow if yellow hits
          red, but it also does not put any pressure on yellow's shot at red.
          Often times, when black misses the shot from C3 at red, it will end up
          south of peg-high on the west boundary and be a tempting free shot for
          yellow from C1.
        

          Shooting at partner ball on turn 3 is the most aggressive line of play
          - taking the shot from A baulk and hitting gives the opportunity to
          play a big croquet stroke loading partner to H2 and attempting to get
          a rush to H1 on the duffer ball - it is a big shot and the break
          chances are normally only reasonable for very strong players. Missing
          partner from A baulk on the other hand gives yellow a ~9 yard shot and
          very strong break prospects. It is therefore more usual to see black
          shoot at blue from C3 which, although longer, doesn't make all the
          balls available to yellow if black misses blue and yellow hits red. It
          also means that blue and black maintain a wide join and have realistic
          prospects of hitting back in if yellow misses red.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a duffer tice
            


Response to 2 balls on EB

          If red has shot at blue on turn 2 and missed, leaving both balls on
          the east boundary, you should carefully evaluate your response based
          on the strength of your opponent. If you and your opponent are evenly
          matched but not world class players, or especially if your opponent is
          a much stronger player than you, then the best thing to do here may be
          to simply ignore the two balls on the east boundary and lag black into
          the middle of the court and wait for yellow to miss. This potentially
          presents you with an immediate break with a ball in the middle of the
          court.
        

          In a match between two very strong players it would be unusual to see
          no shot taken on turn 3, and if hit, some attempt at digging out a
          3-ball break.
        
Response to 2 balls in-court

          In a situation where you have laid a supershot with blue, and red has
          lagged a couple of yards north east of your supershot ball, if there
          is no double target to be had from anywhere on the baulk lines, you
          must again consider your expectations after hitting third turn vs your
          opponent's likelihood of hitting fourth turn. As with previous
          options, if you are playing an opponent who on paper is a much
          stronger player, the percentage play is usually to lag the black ball
          into the middle of the court beside the other two balls (being mindful
          not to leave a double target from anywhere), which will put pressure
          on your stronger opponent to hit in or else concede the first break
          opportunity to you.
        

          If you do want to shoot with black at one of the balls in the middle,
          then consider either shooting at the easterly ball from C1 (you may
          even be able to shoot hard at this without missing to B baulk), or
          alternatively shooting at a medium pace at either blue or red from the
          closest point on A baulk. If you do shoot from the closest point, be
          sure to hit at a pace to finish slightly south of H6, both so that
          black is not a short shot from B baulk, and so that any double target
          that you leave has plenty of space between the front and back ball.
        

          If you are facing a third turn shot with black after red has
          cross-wired blue and red at the peg, check first to see if there is a
          point which you can lag to where blue won't be wired from black, and
          which won't be giving a double target from either baulk line - if
          there is such a spot, then that is the best place to lag to.

 Fourth Ball Options
      

The fourth-turn response is usually actually more simple than then third-turn response - although there are more possible scenarios, they almost always result in yellow trying to roquet something.  
      

Response to ignored WB tice
When black has ignored a standard west boundary tice and insetad shot at (and missed) partner on the east boundary, the obvious response is to then try and hit red yourself from C1.  If the placement of red is good, you should have ~50% chance of hitting in.  Your break prospects after hitting red are actually quite good, as you will play a take off from red to blue & black, which will automatically be sending red towards H2 as a pioneer.  On the other hand, a miss with yellow through red into C2 only gives fairly mediocre break prospects to blue & black in the next turn.
Response to missed WB tice
If black did indeed shoot at red (and miss) from C1 in the previous turn, then the obvious response is to shoot at red yourself, but from a point east of C1 so that a miss will leave yellow joined with red.  If you hit red, your best line of play would be to roll red &  yellow towards C1 and lay a rush for your next turn.  A miss from red at yellow will of course leave black a shot through red and yellow from C2 to C1 but is likely to be a very long shot at a single ball target.  A miss from black on turn 5 here also gives you a good chance at establishing a break on turn 5.  




              If black has missed the standard tice, it leaves a good opportunity to join up with red on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C2 ball after EB opening
Having played red into C2 on turn 2, if black ignores red and simply joins with blue (which is likely), then against most players your best line of play would be to shoot at blue and black with red.  Whether you shoot from A baulk or B baulk depends on factors such as the distance between blue and black (whether it is easy to make a double target from B baulk or A baulk) and the flatness of the east boundary.  If the black ball missed blue badly on the left on turn 3, blue and black may well be 2+ yards apart on the east boundary, so there is a defensive option available to yellow as well - shoot from C3 through to C4, where a miss would not give blue & black any easy opening.
If you are the weaker player against a very strong opponent, then there is a case for shooting yellow at red - at 13 yards, it is significantly shorter than any other available shot and is therefore your best chance at winning the opening.  Red missing yellow gives blue a relatively easy start and a probable break, but against a very strong opponent it can still be worth the risk.  




              Fourth-turn responses for yellow when partner is in C2 and opponent balls are on the east boundary.  
            


Response to joined / missed C2 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, if black has for some reason shot at red in C2, then assuming a double target has been left, your best aggressive option is to shoot at this, preferably hitting the northern ball, from B baulk.  A hit or a miss here will give fairly good break prospects to whomever plays the next shot, given C2's proximity to H2 - a semi-good pioneer can usually be sent to H2 while obtaining a rush to H1.
If black has instead joined up a yard south of red on turn 2, you have no double target (except from C1, but let's not consider that).  Now you have fundamentally two options - either shoot yellow at red which will give a good break opportunity if hit (and concede a good break opportunity to black if missed), or take a more defensive line by shooting yellow at blue from C3 into C4.  If yellow misses this shot, it does give black a 1-yard roquet at red for the innings, however it not only gives no break prospects, but also requires black to play several good strokes in order to have a good leave.  Black's take off from C2 to blue on the east boundary is a difficult shot, and if black doesn't succeed in roqueting blue in its next shot (either taking off short and missing blue, or taking off too far and sending black out) then yellow will have a 9-10 yard shot at blue & black from near C4.




              If black has joined a yard south of red near C2, the yellow has aggressive and defensive options available
            


Response to missed EB ball after Supershot opening
The response here depends a lot on both the length of the supershot ball and what option black chose on turn 3.  Firstly let's assume the most common scenario, with blue halfway between H5 and peg, and 1-2 yards west of the centre line, and red approximately peg high on the EB, and black in or near C4.  In this situation the best option is normally to shoot at red from A baulk, with a miss joining up around 1 yard north of it.  This leaves blue a 15-yarder at red & yellow but difficult break prospects for both players, whomever plays the next shot. 




              The common response after a third-turn miss by black at red to C4, is for yellow to shoot at red, joining if missing.  An aggressive line is to shoot at black.  A third option is yellow at blue, which is shorter and will win you the innings, but only gives good break prospects if red and black are near to each other
            


As the weaker player against a stronger player, a very aggressive line of play would be to shoot yellow from A baulk at black in C4 - this is very black and white, as a hit will give you a good chance for a 4-ball break and a miss will give black the same chance.  As the weaker player, you can strongly consider this option.  
Consider for a moment that black's third-turn shot missed red from A baulk, or perhaps missed red from west of C3, finishing 5-10 yards south of red.  In this case, yellow for look for possible double targets available from B baulk.  Consider, too, the shortest shot available, which is yellow at blue from A baulk - this is likely a 11-13 yard shot which, if hit, gives good break prospects to yellow because red and black are close together.
Response to ignored duffer tice
The vast majority of the time the best response to black ignoring red's duffer tice, is for yellow to shoot hard at red from B baulk.  Usually a duffer tice is only 9-10 yards and so it will be, by far, the shortest shot for yellow.




              The majority of the time, the fourth turn response would be to shoot yellow at the duffer.  Against a very strong player, you might be tempted by yellow at black in C4 which, although 3 yards longer, gives an easy start to your break
            


An expection to this would be if blue & black are joined on the east boundary leaving a good double target from A baulk, and so you may want to consider shooting at that instead.  Another option to consider is if black shot and missed blue from C3 to C4.  If you are playing against a much stronger opponent you may consider shooting yellow at black from A baulk into C4.  This shot is 3 yards longer than yellow at red from B baulk, but hitting this shot gives you vastly stronger break prospects than if you hit red first.
Response to missed duffer tice
If black misses the duffer tice (red) gently, the logical response is to shoot hard at either red from B baulk or black from A baulk (whichever is closer).  If black misses the duffer tice from C3 across to the west boundary, you may consider shooting at black from C1 through to C2, particularly if black is south of peg-high.  




              If the duffer tice is still in its original position at the start of turn 4, the general response is for yellow to shoot at red given its proximity to B baulk.  If black missed red from C3 however, it can be tempting to shoot at black from C1 on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C4 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, red a few inches north of C4 and black 1 yard north of blue, yellow's default response should be to shoot at red from A baulk.  Hitting this shot gives a great break opportunity, as it is a very natural stroke to croquet red to H2 while approaching blue & black up the east boundary.  
Response to 3 balls on EB
In this instance, you simply need to hit one of the balls on the east boundary - from either A baulk or B baulk, depending on length and available targets.
Response to 3 balls in-court
A supershot opening with lags by red and black essentially forces yellow to shoot at the closest ball.  A very black and white opening, good break prospects for both players on turn 4 or 5, depending on whether yellow hits or misses.  Often times, black will have take a gentle lag while attempting a roquet at either blue or red on turn 3, so this may also give yellow some target to shoot at on turn 4.

Conclusion
If you have gotten to the bottom of this article, you have probably realised by now that the number of opening options are vast.  This article could not hope to cover every eventuality, and nor does it present any new or unseen openings; rather it serves to talk through the options and thought processes for choosing a particular option, and I hope it has been useful.

Openings

        The opening is the battle between the two sides to be the first to gain
        the upper hand. Generally when we talk about openings in croquet, we are
        referring to the first 4 turns. At the very top level it is where games
        are won and lost, but at all levels it provides a fascinating array of
        options for bluffing and double-bluffing your opponent.
      
Opening priorities
As the stronger player

        The stronger player who is playing a dangerous but less experienced /
        weaker player will generally approach the opening with the intent of not
        giving away an easy break, and hence a more defensive mindset. Openings
        where there is a lot of grey area, balls on boundaries and in corners
        are best for this. The stronger player will generally rely on their
        better all-round game in order to win, and is more comfortable with
        digging balls out slowly into a break.
      
As the weaker player

        The weaker player should approach a game against a much stronger
        opponent with an attacking mindset - they will not be afraid to take on
        relatively short shots that give laid breaks, even if it means conceding
        a laid break if they miss. The weaker player should favour openings that
        have balls in-lawn and should be looking to put pressure on the stronger
        player to have to hit in.
      
Evenly-matched players

        It is quite common to see very aggressive, black and white, openings
        when two very strong players play against each other. The same is true
        for openings between evenly-matched players at lower levels, but
        generally to a lesser extent. A lot of the opening strategy depends on
        the individual mindset of the player, with some players naturally
        playing a more attacking game than others.
      

        Below are articles on various well-known (and some not-so-well-known)
        openings, which discuss options for placement of balls, and responses to
        them. For the purposes of simplicity, in the examples below, the balls
        will always be played in the following order:
      


 Blue
        

 Red
        


          Black
        


          Yellow
        


Note: there is no ball order or sequence in which the balls need to
          be added to the game in croquet - the above order is simply to keep
          things consistent for the diagrams and explanations.


        As you can probably imagine, the options in the opening are endless.
        This article attempts to talk through some of the most common options,
        and some of the most common responses to them, with the idea of
        clarifying some of the thought processes behind them.
      

The Dream Leave

        Many of the openings below will reference something known as the Dream
        Leave - this is a scenario where the third turn ball (black) has hit and
        arranged the court as follows:
      




            Black hit on turn 3 and set a dream leave
          



        Black has retrieved red from wherever it was on the court and placed it
        slightly in-lawn from the west boundary, north of peg-high, and left
        blue a rush to it from the east boundary. This leave gives no short shot
        for yellow, and any miss by yellow will give blue a good break
        opportunity.

 First
        Ball Options
      

East Boundary

          The most common option selected by the first ball player. A ball to
          the east boundary, somewhere between level with H4 and H5, is chosen
          due to its relative distance from both baulk lines and from H1. It is
          a completely non-threatening ball and allows the second ball player to
          dictate the nature of the game, be it defensive or aggressive.
        
In-lawn East Boundary ball

          A variation on the standard east boundary ball, the in-lawn east
          boundary ball is struck out in the same area as the standard east
          boundary ball, but purposefully left about 1 yard in from the yardline
          area. The idea behind that is so that black can play its third turn
          shot out behind blue and leave itself a rush in-court. This play
          discourages responses like a west boundary tice from red.
        
Supershot

          A supershot ball is a first-turn ball placed near the middle of the
          court, normally between H5 and peg and a couple of yards west of the
          centre line. This is the most aggressive sensible option for the first
          ball, and signals your intent to your opponent that you want no grey
          area. Given its proximity to H1, a supershot ball generally gives a
          good chance for a break for either player, depending on whether the
          third-turn, fourth-turn or fifth-turn shots are hit.
        

          There are variations on the length of the supershot, with a supershot
          played to near the peg being a poorer pioneer for H1 but having the
          advantage of lengthening any fourth-turn shot by yellow at it.
        
Anti-duffer

          This opening is an attempt to try and pre-empt the second-turn
          response and discourage a "duffer tice" by red. To lay an anti-duffer,
          you hit blue to a spot somewhere between H6 and the peg, and 1-2 yards
          west of the east boundary. The idea of placing a ball here is that if
          the opponent were to lay a duffer tice with red,
          then it gives black a good chance to hit red and take off behind blue
          for a rush to H1 on turn 3. It is a leave that is generally only used
          by strong players who have a realistic chance of a third-turn break in
          the first place.
        




              Some common first-ball scenarios
            


Unusual first-turn options

          The croquet court is a big place and so there really are endless
          options for where to place balls in the opening. Often an unusual
          option first-turn will yield good results by confusing the opponent!
        
C4 first ball

          Not often seen these days due to a preference for an east boundary
          ball 10 yards further north. A weakness of this opening is that
          shooting at partner on turn 3 and missing is liable to leave a double
          target for yellow. It also generally encourages yellow to take an
          aggressive shot on turn 4; however on a difficult lawn this opening
          can have some advantages, with any hit by yellow on turn 4 at balls in
          C4 leaving little room to promote balls into the court due to the
          close proximity to the corner.
        
C2 first ball

          Playing blue into C2 first turn can often catch the opponent off
          guard. This opening attempts to flip the tables on red and yellow by
          trying to ensure a defensive opening for blue and black. This can be a
          good option where blue and black are the stronger players and want to
          prevent aggressive second-turn options by red and yellow. Of course,
          there are options available to red and yellow which negate blue and
          black's defensive preferences.
        
Micro tice

          As unusual options go, this is right up there. This option would not
          be recommended when playing a strong player, but nevertheless is very
          interesting. The micro tice is a ball played from the end of A baulk
          towards the east boundary, but only 2-3 yards towards it, leaving a
          2-3 yard roquet for the opponent on the second turn. This length of
          shot cannot really be refused, but leaving red a croquet stroke from
          south-west of hoop 4 on the second turn of the game gives no real
          break prospects. Often the second turn player will attempt an approach
          to H1 and fail it, leaving a 6-yard roquet with two balls near H1 for
          black. This opening relies more on a tactical mistake from red than
          anything else
        
C1 / C3 opening

          Occasionally seen. Not a good opening against any experienced
          opponent, but occasionally yields results. This first-turn option is
          not to be recommended. A first-turn ball in C1 followed by a
          second-turn response to C3 (or vice versa) is a killer blow to black's
          turn.

 Second
        Ball Options
      


          This is where things start to get a little interesting. For the most
          part, the opening is dictated by the second ball response, and there
          are many more options available.
        
Response to East Boundary ball
Standard Tice

          The standard tice is one of the most popular responses to an east
          boundary ball at club-level croquet. Although in recent years it has
          fallen out of favour with top players (likely due to an increase in
          the standard of shooting), it is still a great opening that gives good
          chances to both sides.
        

          The standard tice is where red is played to the west boundary, and the
          distance it is placed north of C1 needs to be carefully considered by
          the striker or red. The name "tice" indicates that the distance should
          be enticing for the player of black to shoot at and so a distance of
          between about 8 and 13 yards is common. As a general rule, if possible
          the distance chosen should either be about 1 yard longer than the
          opponent's critical distance (the distance at which someone hits 50%
          of their shots) or 1 yard shorter (or equal to) your own critical
          distance. Obviously this cannot be achieved if your opponent has a
          longer critical distance than you do, so it is better to err slightly
          on the longer side.
        

          If blue is an in-lawn east boundary ball, laying a standard tice is
          risky, as black can quite easily lay a rush directly to it on the
          third turn.
        
C2 ball

          Probably the most common response to the east boundary ball today is
          the second-turn ball to 6" south of C2. The reason for playing just
          south of C2 is that if in the unlikely event of black shooting at red
          on turn 3, a miss will likely leave yellow a double target. The idea
          of red near C2 means that red is buried in a defensive position, and
          signals yellow's intent to shoot at blue and black on turn 4.
        

          If blue is slightly in-lawn, then C2 is the safest and most defensive
          response with red.
        
Duffer tice

          One of the more aggressive responses for red is the duffer tice. This
          is a ball that is placed usually about 2-feet north and a few inches
          east of penultimate. This is similarly enticing for the opponent to
          shoot (just as with a standard tice) but in this case a miss is
          usually more critical - any third turn shot at the duffer is in the
          direction of A baulk so black usually takes the shot gently - and by
          doing so is more likely to miss. Black missing leaves two balls in the
          centre of the court, giving yellow a great chance on turn 4. The
          duffer tice is a great option for weaker players playing against
          stronger players, and also for anyone confident in hitting 10 yarders.
        

          Between two very strong players a duffer tice is still a popular
          opening. There are variations on the placement of the ball near
          penult, based on the strength of the opponent. It is common to see a
          duffer tice placed level with, or south of, H6, particularly if the
          striker of red and yellow is a very good shot and is confident to hit
          an 11-yarder on turn 4. In a game between experts, the placement of
          red is sometimes moved to the west of H6 to discourage a third-turn
          break after a hit from black at blue.
        
C4 ball

          This option is very popular in New Zealand and although a mirror image
          of the C2 ball, is a lot more aggressive. Placing red 6" north of C4
          not only gives negligible break prospects to black on turn 3 but also
          signals your intent to hit fourth-turn with yellow and have a break. A
          miss at partner by black on turn 3 gives you a 13-yard shot for a
          4-ball break, and a miss by black at red on turn 3 usually gives a
          double target.
        
Shoot at first-turn ball

          A slightly counter-intuitive option but nonetheless an interesting
          one. Shooting red at blue on turn 2 and hitting gives no break
          prospects, but a miss also leaves very slim break prospects for black
          on turn 3 if it hits, unless black is a very strong player. With this
          opening it is quite common to see misses on both turns 2 and 3, and
          often a triple target for yellow at the other 3 balls on turn 4 from B
          baulk.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to east boundary opening
            


Response to Supershot ball

          The supershot ball is the most aggressive opening that the first-turn
          player can use. There are several responses to this which need to be
          considered, based on your assessment of your opponent's ability and
          whether the opponent has realistic prospects of a break to 4-back if
          they do manage to hit 3rd turn.
        
C2 response

          The C2 response is a ball played about 6" south of C2. This is a
          strong response to a supershot against almost all players. If the
          player of black wants to attempt a third-turn break, they will have to
          hit a 13-yarder and play a very difficult croquet stroke out of C2 to
          get a rush to H1, and this is by no means guaranteed. On the other
          hand, a miss by black at red on turn 3 will leave yellow a double
          target and a 4-ball break if hit.
        




              It is important to finish a few inches south of C2 with red as it
              will mean black missing on either side of it will leave a double
              target. Above is a comparison of yellow's target after a
              third-turn miss by black at red, firstly with red in C2 and
              secondly with red a few inches south of C2
            



          There are only a handful of players in the world where the C2 ball is
          not a great response - players who would expect to hit the 13 yarder
          most of the time and also be good enough at croquet strokes to expect
          to get a rush to H1 on the supershot ball. Against these players the
          strategy of lengthing the 3rd turn shot would be preferred.
        
C4 response

          Mirror image to the C2 response, this ball is played 6" north of C4.
          Consider this if blue (the supershot ball) is placed further north
          than normal (somewhere near peg-high), or is in a particular spot
          which may have H4 obscuring any croquet stroke from C4 towards it. It
          otherwise gives all the same advantages as the C2 response
        
Max Distance response

          As a counter to the very top players hitting the ball in C2 most of
          the time, the max distance response became popular - this is where red
          is played to the east boundary about level with the peg on the east
          boundary, leaving the longest shot possible for black. This response
          grants black a shot from C3 through red and into C4, reducing yellow's
          fourth-turn prospects - it relies more on black missing red than
          trying to make any break pick-up by black more difficult. Generally a
          good option against the very best players, but against most players is
          unnecessary.  
The reason why max distance on the east boundary is chosen instead of the equivalent max distance spot on the west boundary is that it is slightly further from the supershot ball (blue), which is slightly south-west of the peg.  Assuming that the shots on turns 3 and 4 are missed, blue's shot at red & yellow on the east boundary will be a couple of yards longer than the equivalent shot to the west boundary.  
Supershot lag

          The response for red to lag to a spot 3-4 yards east and 1-2 yards
          north of the supershot ball is a very strong and very under-used
          response to the supershot. This is a good tactic when playing someone
          who is a very good shot, and in particular if the supershot ball
          itself is quite deep (nearer the peg than H5). Placing red beside blue
          nullifies the strength of black's shooting by encouraging black to
          take its third turn shot gently (which is generally less accurate), or
          risk shooting hard and missing into B baulk, conceding a 4-ball break.
          In this case, black may choose not to shoot at all, and instead also
          lag to a position wide of the other two balls, meaning that red and
          yellow have successfully turned the tables of the supershot opening
          and enabled yellow to have the first attempted roquet.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to supershot opening
            


Roquet the Supershot ball

          The ultimate way to nullify the supershot ball - roquet it on the
          second turn. After roqueting blue with red, there are several options
          available. You can croquet blue towards C2 and then fire red off 6"
          north of C4. A more aggressive option would be to croquet blue
          north-west of H2 and fire red off the south boundary, south of H4 -
          this leaves black a choice of 7-8 yarders but minimal break prospects
          and difficult strokes with their third turn in order to distance the
          balls from baulk. A more novel option would be to crosswire blue and
          red at the peg, which leaves only a 17-yard shot for black with a
          baulk line in the background. An even more interesting option might be
          to roll blue close to the peg, either east or west, and then play red
          a yard or two away from it, wiring blue's backswing at red. This means
          that black probably has no lag option towards blue that doesn't leave
          a double-target for yellow.
        
Response to unusual first-turn options
Response to a first-turn C2 ball

          A first-turn C2 ball is an attempt by blue to make red conform to a
          defensive opening. Red could of course do this if it wants, by playing
          6" north of C4, or even by just having a "standard" east boundary
          ball; however a better option to negate blue's attempt at dictating
          the opening might be to set a duffer tice - this is the ultimate
          aggressive response to the C2 ball, and means that black is suddenly
          faced with having to hit a 10-13 yarder on turn 3 or risk leaving the
          same for yellow next turn, and a laid break.
        
Back to top



 Third
        Ball Options
      

        For the vast majority of players, if they manage to hit in on the third
        turn of the game, they will and should be looking to make a dream leave
        (see top of page) or similar, possibly with red near the peg and blue &
        black with a rush towards it. There are exceptions to this line of play,
        mainly with supershot openings, but unless otherwise stated, the
        standard play would be to try and set a dream leave.
      

Response to WB tice after EB opening

          Realistically, black will not be attempting to make any break on turn
          3 if it manages to hit in. The player of black has to make a judgement
          call on their likelihood of hitting the standard tice vs their
          opponent's likelihood of missing it.
        


            If the tice is long, the best response is probably to shoot black at
            blue from A baulk. Missing black at blue leaves the free shot at the
            tice for yellow of course, which does give yellow fairly good
            prospects if hit. If the tice is extremely long, say peg-high, then
            black could quite feasibly just lag at blue and attempt to leave a
            rush to red. Bear in mind that playing this lag so early in the game
            may be difficult as you may not have the pace of the court - and
            there is a risk that lagging at blue and falling short will leave
            yellow a double target on turn 4.
          

            Another option if black is uncertain, would be to shoot at blue from
            C3, and missing through to C4. This hedges black's bets somewhat, as
            it is still taking a shot at a ball and still somewhat joining with
            partner ball, but does not give good break prospects to the opponent
            if yellow hits, due to the proximity of blue and black to one
            another. Yellow is faced with a long takeoff from red towards blue
            and black and in all likelihood will not get a rush to H1 from this
            position.
          

            The third option is of course to shoot at the tice itself. Hitting
            red will give the opportunity to make a dream leave (as shown at the
            top of the page). Missing red will send black towards C2, which will
            give black a free shot back through red and yellow if yellow misses
            its fourth-turn shot at red.
          





              Some common third-ball responses to a standard tice
            


Response to C2 ball after EB opening

          There are two common options after a second-turn C2 ball - both
          consist of shooting at partner. If partner is hit, then usually the
          play will be to take off to the red in C2, roquet it and then croquet
          it either into the centre of the court, or along the west boundary,
          then lag back to partner and leave a rush in-court. However, consider
          a game where you are the stronger player playing a very capable weaker
          player, if you do hit partner third turn, you can elect to just set a
          rush to the C2 ball instead of trying to retrieve it from C2. As the
          stronger player you may prefer this line of play, instead of digging
          out the C2 ball only for your opponent to hit on turn 4 and have an
          easy break.
        

          Usually the third-turn shot at partner with black will be from A
          baulk, joining up on the east boundary if missed. This leaves a long
          double target for yellow from the end of B baulk. A more defensive
          play would be to shoot at partner from C3 into C4. Doing this leaves
          almost no break prospects fourth-turn for yellow but, depending on the
          distance between blue and black, may give them the opportunity to join
          up.
        

          Another option for black on turn 3 would be to shoot at red in C2 -
          however usually this is only a viable option if red is exactly in the
          corner, as it will mean that missing red on the right leaves no double
          target for yellow. Alternatively, another option would be for black to
          join up with red near C2, about 3-4 feet south of it. Doing so leaves
          no double target from B baulk and gives good break prospects to black
          if yellow misses the 13 yarder, although it must be remembered that
          yellow also has good prospects if it hits the 13 yarder. Black joining
          up with red also leaves a defensive shot for yellow at blue from C3 to
          C4 which, if missed, leaves black a very long and tricky takeoff from
          C2 to the east boundary.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a C2 ball
            


Response to C2 / C4 ball after Supershot opening

          The third-turn response to this option depends greatly on your ability
          and also the ability of your opponent. Before you lay the supershot,
          you need to ask yourself "am I realistically good enough to play a
          third-turn break to 4-back?". If the answer is no, then that does not
          mean that the supershot opening is a bad idea at all, but it just
          means that you may want to reassess your third-turn response.
          Additionally, if you are playing someone that you believe is much
          better than you are, then trying to give yourself a 4-ball break on
          turn 5 is exactly what you should be trying to achieve. Therefore,
          instead of trying to roquet the 13 yard shot of black at red just
          south of C2 (or just north of C4), you can instead look to join up
          with the ball 3-4 feet away, ensuring to leave no double target. This
          puts a great deal of pressure on your stronger opponent to then hit a
          13 yarder or else concede a 4-ball break to you.
        

          If you believe you are good enough to hit on turn 3 and play a break,
          then the answer is simple - hit red near C2 and go round.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / C2 ball
            


Response to EB ball after Supershot opening

          In most cases, the third-turn response to a max distance ball is to
          try and hit it from C3, missing into C4. Again, however, you should
          evaluate your own likelihood of playing a break to 4-back with only 3
          balls on the lawn if you hit, and so you may want to consider lagging
          to the ball, a couple of yards in-lawn from the east boundary.
        

          If the ball on the east boundary is south of the peg, it is tempting
          to simply shoot at it from A baulk. Missing will of course leave a
          double from B baulk, but the odds of yellow then hitting a double
          target from 20+ yards is no certainty. Alternatively, if the
          second-turn ball is around peg-high, then shooting at it from B baulk
          from a few yards west of C3 and missing often results in a fairly even
          spread of the balls, with your black ball being approximately 8 yards
          south of red and 8 yards north of C4. This again is technically a
          double target from somewhere on B Baulk, but given the distance
          between red and black, is easily missed and will leave your black ball
          a shot of only 8 yards.

Response to C4 ball after EB opening

          This opening creates one of the more interesting third-turn decisions.
          A second-turn ball 6" north of C4 is a very threatening position and
          therefore the options will as follows:
        


            Shoot at partner
            
Hit - set a dream leave

                Miss - leaves yellow a 13-yard shot at red in C4 for a 4-ball
                break
              



            Shoot at opponent near C4 from A baulk
            

                Hit - set a dream leave (you may want to have a go at gaining a
                rush to H1 on partner)
              

                Miss - leave a 13-yard double for yellow (but slightly tricky
                break pick-up)
              



            Join up with opponent near C4, leaving no double
            

                If red is 3-6" north of C4 - join a yard north of it from A
                baulk
                
No short double target is left for yellow

                    Yellow still only has a 13-yard shot for the innings (but a
                    slightly tricky break pick-up)
                  



                If red is ~12" north of C4 - shoot from C3 through to C4
                

                    Enables black to have a shot (albeit very long) to attempt
                    to hit and set a dream leave
                  




Black to C2


              By burying itself in C2, this enables black to kill off the
              aggression by red and yellow. Any miss by yellow will leave a 9
              yarder (at most) for blue
            






              Some common third-ball responses to a C4 ball
            



          A personal preference of mine is to shoot third-turn at the ball near
          C4 from A baulk, because hitting gives me control of the court, and I
          miss often enough by more than several inches so as not to leave a
          double.
        

          Be on the lookout for cannons around C4 as part of this opening -
          there is often a good opportunity to bombard a live ball across to H1
          while playing a croquet stroke towards blue on the east boundary. This
          can make picking up the first break a great deal easier.
        
Response to duffer tice after EB opening

          The duffer tice is one of my favourite openings. Because of the
          placement of red near H6, a miss by black from the end of B baulk will
          be headed towards A baulk and give an easy start for yellow. That is
          why we see the ~9 yard shot at red refused so often, even by very
          strong players!
        

          If black does decide to shoot at the duffer and hits, then not a great
          deal of options are available other than to take off to partner ball
          (usually nudging red towards the peg in the process), and leave a rush
          towards red, and then hope for a fourth-turn miss by yellow.
        

          Another option for shooting at the duffer is doing so from C3,
          shooting across the court and missing to around peg-high (or just
          south of peg-high) on the west boundary. This is the most defensive
          shot available in that a miss gives no break to yellow if yellow hits
          red, but it also does not put any pressure on yellow's shot at red.
          Often times, when black misses the shot from C3 at red, it will end up
          south of peg-high on the west boundary and be a tempting free shot for
          yellow from C1.
        

          Shooting at partner ball on turn 3 is the most aggressive line of play
          - taking the shot from A baulk and hitting gives the opportunity to
          play a big croquet stroke loading partner to H2 and attempting to get
          a rush to H1 on the duffer ball - it is a big shot and the break
          chances are normally only reasonable for very strong players. Missing
          partner from A baulk on the other hand gives yellow a ~9 yard shot and
          very strong break prospects. It is therefore more usual to see black
          shoot at blue from C3 which, although longer, doesn't make all the
          balls available to yellow if black misses blue and yellow hits red. It
          also means that blue and black maintain a wide join and have realistic
          prospects of hitting back in if yellow misses red.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a duffer tice
            


Response to 2 balls on EB

          If red has shot at blue on turn 2 and missed, leaving both balls on
          the east boundary, you should carefully evaluate your response based
          on the strength of your opponent. If you and your opponent are evenly
          matched but not world class players, or especially if your opponent is
          a much stronger player than you, then the best thing to do here may be
          to simply ignore the two balls on the east boundary and lag black into
          the middle of the court and wait for yellow to miss. This potentially
          presents you with an immediate break with a ball in the middle of the
          court.
        

          In a match between two very strong players it would be unusual to see
          no shot taken on turn 3, and if hit, some attempt at digging out a
          3-ball break.
        
Response to 2 balls in-court

          In a situation where you have laid a supershot with blue, and red has
          lagged a couple of yards north east of your supershot ball, if there
          is no double target to be had from anywhere on the baulk lines, you
          must again consider your expectations after hitting third turn vs your
          opponent's likelihood of hitting fourth turn. As with previous
          options, if you are playing an opponent who on paper is a much
          stronger player, the percentage play is usually to lag the black ball
          into the middle of the court beside the other two balls (being mindful
          not to leave a double target from anywhere), which will put pressure
          on your stronger opponent to hit in or else concede the first break
          opportunity to you.
        

          If you do want to shoot with black at one of the balls in the middle,
          then consider either shooting at the easterly ball from C1 (you may
          even be able to shoot hard at this without missing to B baulk), or
          alternatively shooting at a medium pace at either blue or red from the
          closest point on A baulk. If you do shoot from the closest point, be
          sure to hit at a pace to finish slightly south of H6, both so that
          black is not a short shot from B baulk, and so that any double target
          that you leave has plenty of space between the front and back ball.
        

          If you are facing a third turn shot with black after red has
          cross-wired blue and red at the peg, check first to see if there is a
          point which you can lag to where blue won't be wired from black, and
          which won't be giving a double target from either baulk line - if
          there is such a spot, then that is the best place to lag to.

 Fourth Ball Options
      

The fourth-turn response is usually actually more simple than then third-turn response - although there are more possible scenarios, they almost always result in yellow trying to roquet something.  
      

Response to ignored WB tice
When black has ignored a standard west boundary tice and insetad shot at (and missed) partner on the east boundary, the obvious response is to then try and hit red yourself from C1.  If the placement of red is good, you should have ~50% chance of hitting in.  Your break prospects after hitting red are actually quite good, as you will play a take off from red to blue & black, which will automatically be sending red towards H2 as a pioneer.  On the other hand, a miss with yellow through red into C2 only gives fairly mediocre break prospects to blue & black in the next turn.
Response to missed WB tice
If black did indeed shoot at red (and miss) from C1 in the previous turn, then the obvious response is to shoot at red yourself, but from a point east of C1 so that a miss will leave yellow joined with red.  If you hit red, your best line of play would be to roll red &  yellow towards C1 and lay a rush for your next turn.  A miss from red at yellow will of course leave black a shot through red and yellow from C2 to C1 but is likely to be a very long shot at a single ball target.  A miss from black on turn 5 here also gives you a good chance at establishing a break on turn 5.  




              If black has missed the standard tice, it leaves a good opportunity to join up with red on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C2 ball after EB opening
Having played red into C2 on turn 2, if black ignores red and simply joins with blue (which is likely), then against most players your best line of play would be to shoot at blue and black with red.  Whether you shoot from A baulk or B baulk depends on factors such as the distance between blue and black (whether it is easy to make a double target from B baulk or A baulk) and the flatness of the east boundary.  If the black ball missed blue badly on the left on turn 3, blue and black may well be 2+ yards apart on the east boundary, so there is a defensive option available to yellow as well - shoot from C3 through to C4, where a miss would not give blue & black any easy opening.
If you are the weaker player against a very strong opponent, then there is a case for shooting yellow at red - at 13 yards, it is significantly shorter than any other available shot and is therefore your best chance at winning the opening.  Red missing yellow gives blue a relatively easy start and a probable break, but against a very strong opponent it can still be worth the risk.  




              Fourth-turn responses for yellow when partner is in C2 and opponent balls are on the east boundary.  
            


Response to joined / missed C2 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, if black has for some reason shot at red in C2, then assuming a double target has been left, your best aggressive option is to shoot at this, preferably hitting the northern ball, from B baulk.  A hit or a miss here will give fairly good break prospects to whomever plays the next shot, given C2's proximity to H2 - a semi-good pioneer can usually be sent to H2 while obtaining a rush to H1.
If black has instead joined up a yard south of red on turn 2, you have no double target (except from C1, but let's not consider that).  Now you have fundamentally two options - either shoot yellow at red which will give a good break opportunity if hit (and concede a good break opportunity to black if missed), or take a more defensive line by shooting yellow at blue from C3 into C4.  If yellow misses this shot, it does give black a 1-yard roquet at red for the innings, however it not only gives no break prospects, but also requires black to play several good strokes in order to have a good leave.  Black's take off from C2 to blue on the east boundary is a difficult shot, and if black doesn't succeed in roqueting blue in its next shot (either taking off short and missing blue, or taking off too far and sending black out) then yellow will have a 9-10 yard shot at blue & black from near C4.




              If black has joined a yard south of red near C2, the yellow has aggressive and defensive options available
            


Response to missed EB ball after Supershot opening
The response here depends a lot on both the length of the supershot ball and what option black chose on turn 3.  Firstly let's assume the most common scenario, with blue halfway between H5 and peg, and 1-2 yards west of the centre line, and red approximately peg high on the EB, and black in or near C4.  In this situation the best option is normally to shoot at red from A baulk, with a miss joining up around 1 yard north of it.  This leaves blue a 15-yarder at red & yellow but difficult break prospects for both players, whomever plays the next shot. 




              The common response after a third-turn miss by black at red to C4, is for yellow to shoot at red, joining if missing.  An aggressive line is to shoot at black.  A third option is yellow at blue, which is shorter and will win you the innings, but only gives good break prospects if red and black are near to each other
            


As the weaker player against a stronger player, a very aggressive line of play would be to shoot yellow from A baulk at black in C4 - this is very black and white, as a hit will give you a good chance for a 4-ball break and a miss will give black the same chance.  As the weaker player, you can strongly consider this option.  
Consider for a moment that black's third-turn shot missed red from A baulk, or perhaps missed red from west of C3, finishing 5-10 yards south of red.  In this case, yellow for look for possible double targets available from B baulk.  Consider, too, the shortest shot available, which is yellow at blue from A baulk - this is likely a 11-13 yard shot which, if hit, gives good break prospects to yellow because red and black are close together.
Response to ignored duffer tice
The vast majority of the time the best response to black ignoring red's duffer tice, is for yellow to shoot hard at red from B baulk.  Usually a duffer tice is only 9-10 yards and so it will be, by far, the shortest shot for yellow.




              The majority of the time, the fourth turn response would be to shoot yellow at the duffer.  Against a very strong player, you might be tempted by yellow at black in C4 which, although 3 yards longer, gives an easy start to your break
            


An expection to this would be if blue & black are joined on the east boundary leaving a good double target from A baulk, and so you may want to consider shooting at that instead.  Another option to consider is if black shot and missed blue from C3 to C4.  If you are playing against a much stronger opponent you may consider shooting yellow at black from A baulk into C4.  This shot is 3 yards longer than yellow at red from B baulk, but hitting this shot gives you vastly stronger break prospects than if you hit red first.
Response to missed duffer tice
If black misses the duffer tice (red) gently, the logical response is to shoot hard at either red from B baulk or black from A baulk (whichever is closer).  If black misses the duffer tice from C3 across to the west boundary, you may consider shooting at black from C1 through to C2, particularly if black is south of peg-high.  




              If the duffer tice is still in its original position at the start of turn 4, the general response is for yellow to shoot at red given its proximity to B baulk.  If black missed red from C3 however, it can be tempting to shoot at black from C1 on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C4 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, red a few inches north of C4 and black 1 yard north of blue, yellow's default response should be to shoot at red from A baulk.  Hitting this shot gives a great break opportunity, as it is a very natural stroke to croquet red to H2 while approaching blue & black up the east boundary.  
Response to 3 balls on EB
In this instance, you simply need to hit one of the balls on the east boundary - from either A baulk or B baulk, depending on length and available targets.
Response to 3 balls in-court
A supershot opening with lags by red and black essentially forces yellow to shoot at the closest ball.  A very black and white opening, good break prospects for both players on turn 4 or 5, depending on whether yellow hits or misses.  Often times, black will have take a gentle lag while attempting a roquet at either blue or red on turn 3, so this may also give yellow some target to shoot at on turn 4.

Conclusion
If you have gotten to the bottom of this article, you have probably realised by now that the number of opening options are vast.  This article could not hope to cover every eventuality, and nor does it present any new or unseen openings; rather it serves to talk through the options and thought processes for choosing a particular option, and I hope it has been useful.

Openings

        The opening is the battle between the two sides to be the first to gain
        the upper hand. Generally when we talk about openings in croquet, we are
        referring to the first 4 turns. At the very top level it is where games
        are won and lost, but at all levels it provides a fascinating array of
        options for bluffing and double-bluffing your opponent.
      
Opening priorities
As the stronger player

        The stronger player who is playing a dangerous but less experienced /
        weaker player will generally approach the opening with the intent of not
        giving away an easy break, and hence a more defensive mindset. Openings
        where there is a lot of grey area, balls on boundaries and in corners
        are best for this. The stronger player will generally rely on their
        better all-round game in order to win, and is more comfortable with
        digging balls out slowly into a break.
      
As the weaker player

        The weaker player should approach a game against a much stronger
        opponent with an attacking mindset - they will not be afraid to take on
        relatively short shots that give laid breaks, even if it means conceding
        a laid break if they miss. The weaker player should favour openings that
        have balls in-lawn and should be looking to put pressure on the stronger
        player to have to hit in.
      
Evenly-matched players

        It is quite common to see very aggressive, black and white, openings
        when two very strong players play against each other. The same is true
        for openings between evenly-matched players at lower levels, but
        generally to a lesser extent. A lot of the opening strategy depends on
        the individual mindset of the player, with some players naturally
        playing a more attacking game than others.
      

        Below are articles on various well-known (and some not-so-well-known)
        openings, which discuss options for placement of balls, and responses to
        them. For the purposes of simplicity, in the examples below, the balls
        will always be played in the following order:
      


 Blue
        

 Red
        


          Black
        


          Yellow
        


Note: there is no ball order or sequence in which the balls need to
          be added to the game in croquet - the above order is simply to keep
          things consistent for the diagrams and explanations.


        As you can probably imagine, the options in the opening are endless.
        This article attempts to talk through some of the most common options,
        and some of the most common responses to them, with the idea of
        clarifying some of the thought processes behind them.
      

The Dream Leave

        Many of the openings below will reference something known as the Dream
        Leave - this is a scenario where the third turn ball (black) has hit and
        arranged the court as follows:
      




            Black hit on turn 3 and set a dream leave
          



        Black has retrieved red from wherever it was on the court and placed it
        slightly in-lawn from the west boundary, north of peg-high, and left
        blue a rush to it from the east boundary. This leave gives no short shot
        for yellow, and any miss by yellow will give blue a good break
        opportunity.

 First
        Ball Options
      

East Boundary

          The most common option selected by the first ball player. A ball to
          the east boundary, somewhere between level with H4 and H5, is chosen
          due to its relative distance from both baulk lines and from H1. It is
          a completely non-threatening ball and allows the second ball player to
          dictate the nature of the game, be it defensive or aggressive.
        
In-lawn East Boundary ball

          A variation on the standard east boundary ball, the in-lawn east
          boundary ball is struck out in the same area as the standard east
          boundary ball, but purposefully left about 1 yard in from the yardline
          area. The idea behind that is so that black can play its third turn
          shot out behind blue and leave itself a rush in-court. This play
          discourages responses like a west boundary tice from red.
        
Supershot

          A supershot ball is a first-turn ball placed near the middle of the
          court, normally between H5 and peg and a couple of yards west of the
          centre line. This is the most aggressive sensible option for the first
          ball, and signals your intent to your opponent that you want no grey
          area. Given its proximity to H1, a supershot ball generally gives a
          good chance for a break for either player, depending on whether the
          third-turn, fourth-turn or fifth-turn shots are hit.
        

          There are variations on the length of the supershot, with a supershot
          played to near the peg being a poorer pioneer for H1 but having the
          advantage of lengthening any fourth-turn shot by yellow at it.
        
Anti-duffer

          This opening is an attempt to try and pre-empt the second-turn
          response and discourage a "duffer tice" by red. To lay an anti-duffer,
          you hit blue to a spot somewhere between H6 and the peg, and 1-2 yards
          west of the east boundary. The idea of placing a ball here is that if
          the opponent were to lay a duffer tice with red,
          then it gives black a good chance to hit red and take off behind blue
          for a rush to H1 on turn 3. It is a leave that is generally only used
          by strong players who have a realistic chance of a third-turn break in
          the first place.
        




              Some common first-ball scenarios
            


Unusual first-turn options

          The croquet court is a big place and so there really are endless
          options for where to place balls in the opening. Often an unusual
          option first-turn will yield good results by confusing the opponent!
        
C4 first ball

          Not often seen these days due to a preference for an east boundary
          ball 10 yards further north. A weakness of this opening is that
          shooting at partner on turn 3 and missing is liable to leave a double
          target for yellow. It also generally encourages yellow to take an
          aggressive shot on turn 4; however on a difficult lawn this opening
          can have some advantages, with any hit by yellow on turn 4 at balls in
          C4 leaving little room to promote balls into the court due to the
          close proximity to the corner.
        
C2 first ball

          Playing blue into C2 first turn can often catch the opponent off
          guard. This opening attempts to flip the tables on red and yellow by
          trying to ensure a defensive opening for blue and black. This can be a
          good option where blue and black are the stronger players and want to
          prevent aggressive second-turn options by red and yellow. Of course,
          there are options available to red and yellow which negate blue and
          black's defensive preferences.
        
Micro tice

          As unusual options go, this is right up there. This option would not
          be recommended when playing a strong player, but nevertheless is very
          interesting. The micro tice is a ball played from the end of A baulk
          towards the east boundary, but only 2-3 yards towards it, leaving a
          2-3 yard roquet for the opponent on the second turn. This length of
          shot cannot really be refused, but leaving red a croquet stroke from
          south-west of hoop 4 on the second turn of the game gives no real
          break prospects. Often the second turn player will attempt an approach
          to H1 and fail it, leaving a 6-yard roquet with two balls near H1 for
          black. This opening relies more on a tactical mistake from red than
          anything else
        
C1 / C3 opening

          Occasionally seen. Not a good opening against any experienced
          opponent, but occasionally yields results. This first-turn option is
          not to be recommended. A first-turn ball in C1 followed by a
          second-turn response to C3 (or vice versa) is a killer blow to black's
          turn.

 Second
        Ball Options
      


          This is where things start to get a little interesting. For the most
          part, the opening is dictated by the second ball response, and there
          are many more options available.
        
Response to East Boundary ball
Standard Tice

          The standard tice is one of the most popular responses to an east
          boundary ball at club-level croquet. Although in recent years it has
          fallen out of favour with top players (likely due to an increase in
          the standard of shooting), it is still a great opening that gives good
          chances to both sides.
        

          The standard tice is where red is played to the west boundary, and the
          distance it is placed north of C1 needs to be carefully considered by
          the striker or red. The name "tice" indicates that the distance should
          be enticing for the player of black to shoot at and so a distance of
          between about 8 and 13 yards is common. As a general rule, if possible
          the distance chosen should either be about 1 yard longer than the
          opponent's critical distance (the distance at which someone hits 50%
          of their shots) or 1 yard shorter (or equal to) your own critical
          distance. Obviously this cannot be achieved if your opponent has a
          longer critical distance than you do, so it is better to err slightly
          on the longer side.
        

          If blue is an in-lawn east boundary ball, laying a standard tice is
          risky, as black can quite easily lay a rush directly to it on the
          third turn.
        
C2 ball

          Probably the most common response to the east boundary ball today is
          the second-turn ball to 6" south of C2. The reason for playing just
          south of C2 is that if in the unlikely event of black shooting at red
          on turn 3, a miss will likely leave yellow a double target. The idea
          of red near C2 means that red is buried in a defensive position, and
          signals yellow's intent to shoot at blue and black on turn 4.
        

          If blue is slightly in-lawn, then C2 is the safest and most defensive
          response with red.
        
Duffer tice

          One of the more aggressive responses for red is the duffer tice. This
          is a ball that is placed usually about 2-feet north and a few inches
          east of penultimate. This is similarly enticing for the opponent to
          shoot (just as with a standard tice) but in this case a miss is
          usually more critical - any third turn shot at the duffer is in the
          direction of A baulk so black usually takes the shot gently - and by
          doing so is more likely to miss. Black missing leaves two balls in the
          centre of the court, giving yellow a great chance on turn 4. The
          duffer tice is a great option for weaker players playing against
          stronger players, and also for anyone confident in hitting 10 yarders.
        

          Between two very strong players a duffer tice is still a popular
          opening. There are variations on the placement of the ball near
          penult, based on the strength of the opponent. It is common to see a
          duffer tice placed level with, or south of, H6, particularly if the
          striker of red and yellow is a very good shot and is confident to hit
          an 11-yarder on turn 4. In a game between experts, the placement of
          red is sometimes moved to the west of H6 to discourage a third-turn
          break after a hit from black at blue.
        
C4 ball

          This option is very popular in New Zealand and although a mirror image
          of the C2 ball, is a lot more aggressive. Placing red 6" north of C4
          not only gives negligible break prospects to black on turn 3 but also
          signals your intent to hit fourth-turn with yellow and have a break. A
          miss at partner by black on turn 3 gives you a 13-yard shot for a
          4-ball break, and a miss by black at red on turn 3 usually gives a
          double target.
        
Shoot at first-turn ball

          A slightly counter-intuitive option but nonetheless an interesting
          one. Shooting red at blue on turn 2 and hitting gives no break
          prospects, but a miss also leaves very slim break prospects for black
          on turn 3 if it hits, unless black is a very strong player. With this
          opening it is quite common to see misses on both turns 2 and 3, and
          often a triple target for yellow at the other 3 balls on turn 4 from B
          baulk.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to east boundary opening
            


Response to Supershot ball

          The supershot ball is the most aggressive opening that the first-turn
          player can use. There are several responses to this which need to be
          considered, based on your assessment of your opponent's ability and
          whether the opponent has realistic prospects of a break to 4-back if
          they do manage to hit 3rd turn.
        
C2 response

          The C2 response is a ball played about 6" south of C2. This is a
          strong response to a supershot against almost all players. If the
          player of black wants to attempt a third-turn break, they will have to
          hit a 13-yarder and play a very difficult croquet stroke out of C2 to
          get a rush to H1, and this is by no means guaranteed. On the other
          hand, a miss by black at red on turn 3 will leave yellow a double
          target and a 4-ball break if hit.
        




              It is important to finish a few inches south of C2 with red as it
              will mean black missing on either side of it will leave a double
              target. Above is a comparison of yellow's target after a
              third-turn miss by black at red, firstly with red in C2 and
              secondly with red a few inches south of C2
            



          There are only a handful of players in the world where the C2 ball is
          not a great response - players who would expect to hit the 13 yarder
          most of the time and also be good enough at croquet strokes to expect
          to get a rush to H1 on the supershot ball. Against these players the
          strategy of lengthing the 3rd turn shot would be preferred.
        
C4 response

          Mirror image to the C2 response, this ball is played 6" north of C4.
          Consider this if blue (the supershot ball) is placed further north
          than normal (somewhere near peg-high), or is in a particular spot
          which may have H4 obscuring any croquet stroke from C4 towards it. It
          otherwise gives all the same advantages as the C2 response
        
Max Distance response

          As a counter to the very top players hitting the ball in C2 most of
          the time, the max distance response became popular - this is where red
          is played to the east boundary about level with the peg on the east
          boundary, leaving the longest shot possible for black. This response
          grants black a shot from C3 through red and into C4, reducing yellow's
          fourth-turn prospects - it relies more on black missing red than
          trying to make any break pick-up by black more difficult. Generally a
          good option against the very best players, but against most players is
          unnecessary.  
The reason why max distance on the east boundary is chosen instead of the equivalent max distance spot on the west boundary is that it is slightly further from the supershot ball (blue), which is slightly south-west of the peg.  Assuming that the shots on turns 3 and 4 are missed, blue's shot at red & yellow on the east boundary will be a couple of yards longer than the equivalent shot to the west boundary.  
Supershot lag

          The response for red to lag to a spot 3-4 yards east and 1-2 yards
          north of the supershot ball is a very strong and very under-used
          response to the supershot. This is a good tactic when playing someone
          who is a very good shot, and in particular if the supershot ball
          itself is quite deep (nearer the peg than H5). Placing red beside blue
          nullifies the strength of black's shooting by encouraging black to
          take its third turn shot gently (which is generally less accurate), or
          risk shooting hard and missing into B baulk, conceding a 4-ball break.
          In this case, black may choose not to shoot at all, and instead also
          lag to a position wide of the other two balls, meaning that red and
          yellow have successfully turned the tables of the supershot opening
          and enabled yellow to have the first attempted roquet.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to supershot opening
            


Roquet the Supershot ball

          The ultimate way to nullify the supershot ball - roquet it on the
          second turn. After roqueting blue with red, there are several options
          available. You can croquet blue towards C2 and then fire red off 6"
          north of C4. A more aggressive option would be to croquet blue
          north-west of H2 and fire red off the south boundary, south of H4 -
          this leaves black a choice of 7-8 yarders but minimal break prospects
          and difficult strokes with their third turn in order to distance the
          balls from baulk. A more novel option would be to crosswire blue and
          red at the peg, which leaves only a 17-yard shot for black with a
          baulk line in the background. An even more interesting option might be
          to roll blue close to the peg, either east or west, and then play red
          a yard or two away from it, wiring blue's backswing at red. This means
          that black probably has no lag option towards blue that doesn't leave
          a double-target for yellow.
        
Response to unusual first-turn options
Response to a first-turn C2 ball

          A first-turn C2 ball is an attempt by blue to make red conform to a
          defensive opening. Red could of course do this if it wants, by playing
          6" north of C4, or even by just having a "standard" east boundary
          ball; however a better option to negate blue's attempt at dictating
          the opening might be to set a duffer tice - this is the ultimate
          aggressive response to the C2 ball, and means that black is suddenly
          faced with having to hit a 10-13 yarder on turn 3 or risk leaving the
          same for yellow next turn, and a laid break.
        
Back to top



 Third
        Ball Options
      

        For the vast majority of players, if they manage to hit in on the third
        turn of the game, they will and should be looking to make a dream leave
        (see top of page) or similar, possibly with red near the peg and blue &
        black with a rush towards it. There are exceptions to this line of play,
        mainly with supershot openings, but unless otherwise stated, the
        standard play would be to try and set a dream leave.
      

Response to WB tice after EB opening

          Realistically, black will not be attempting to make any break on turn
          3 if it manages to hit in. The player of black has to make a judgement
          call on their likelihood of hitting the standard tice vs their
          opponent's likelihood of missing it.
        


            If the tice is long, the best response is probably to shoot black at
            blue from A baulk. Missing black at blue leaves the free shot at the
            tice for yellow of course, which does give yellow fairly good
            prospects if hit. If the tice is extremely long, say peg-high, then
            black could quite feasibly just lag at blue and attempt to leave a
            rush to red. Bear in mind that playing this lag so early in the game
            may be difficult as you may not have the pace of the court - and
            there is a risk that lagging at blue and falling short will leave
            yellow a double target on turn 4.
          

            Another option if black is uncertain, would be to shoot at blue from
            C3, and missing through to C4. This hedges black's bets somewhat, as
            it is still taking a shot at a ball and still somewhat joining with
            partner ball, but does not give good break prospects to the opponent
            if yellow hits, due to the proximity of blue and black to one
            another. Yellow is faced with a long takeoff from red towards blue
            and black and in all likelihood will not get a rush to H1 from this
            position.
          

            The third option is of course to shoot at the tice itself. Hitting
            red will give the opportunity to make a dream leave (as shown at the
            top of the page). Missing red will send black towards C2, which will
            give black a free shot back through red and yellow if yellow misses
            its fourth-turn shot at red.
          





              Some common third-ball responses to a standard tice
            


Response to C2 ball after EB opening

          There are two common options after a second-turn C2 ball - both
          consist of shooting at partner. If partner is hit, then usually the
          play will be to take off to the red in C2, roquet it and then croquet
          it either into the centre of the court, or along the west boundary,
          then lag back to partner and leave a rush in-court. However, consider
          a game where you are the stronger player playing a very capable weaker
          player, if you do hit partner third turn, you can elect to just set a
          rush to the C2 ball instead of trying to retrieve it from C2. As the
          stronger player you may prefer this line of play, instead of digging
          out the C2 ball only for your opponent to hit on turn 4 and have an
          easy break.
        

          Usually the third-turn shot at partner with black will be from A
          baulk, joining up on the east boundary if missed. This leaves a long
          double target for yellow from the end of B baulk. A more defensive
          play would be to shoot at partner from C3 into C4. Doing this leaves
          almost no break prospects fourth-turn for yellow but, depending on the
          distance between blue and black, may give them the opportunity to join
          up.
        

          Another option for black on turn 3 would be to shoot at red in C2 -
          however usually this is only a viable option if red is exactly in the
          corner, as it will mean that missing red on the right leaves no double
          target for yellow. Alternatively, another option would be for black to
          join up with red near C2, about 3-4 feet south of it. Doing so leaves
          no double target from B baulk and gives good break prospects to black
          if yellow misses the 13 yarder, although it must be remembered that
          yellow also has good prospects if it hits the 13 yarder. Black joining
          up with red also leaves a defensive shot for yellow at blue from C3 to
          C4 which, if missed, leaves black a very long and tricky takeoff from
          C2 to the east boundary.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a C2 ball
            


Response to C2 / C4 ball after Supershot opening

          The third-turn response to this option depends greatly on your ability
          and also the ability of your opponent. Before you lay the supershot,
          you need to ask yourself "am I realistically good enough to play a
          third-turn break to 4-back?". If the answer is no, then that does not
          mean that the supershot opening is a bad idea at all, but it just
          means that you may want to reassess your third-turn response.
          Additionally, if you are playing someone that you believe is much
          better than you are, then trying to give yourself a 4-ball break on
          turn 5 is exactly what you should be trying to achieve. Therefore,
          instead of trying to roquet the 13 yard shot of black at red just
          south of C2 (or just north of C4), you can instead look to join up
          with the ball 3-4 feet away, ensuring to leave no double target. This
          puts a great deal of pressure on your stronger opponent to then hit a
          13 yarder or else concede a 4-ball break to you.
        

          If you believe you are good enough to hit on turn 3 and play a break,
          then the answer is simple - hit red near C2 and go round.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / C2 ball
            


Response to EB ball after Supershot opening

          In most cases, the third-turn response to a max distance ball is to
          try and hit it from C3, missing into C4. Again, however, you should
          evaluate your own likelihood of playing a break to 4-back with only 3
          balls on the lawn if you hit, and so you may want to consider lagging
          to the ball, a couple of yards in-lawn from the east boundary.
        

          If the ball on the east boundary is south of the peg, it is tempting
          to simply shoot at it from A baulk. Missing will of course leave a
          double from B baulk, but the odds of yellow then hitting a double
          target from 20+ yards is no certainty. Alternatively, if the
          second-turn ball is around peg-high, then shooting at it from B baulk
          from a few yards west of C3 and missing often results in a fairly even
          spread of the balls, with your black ball being approximately 8 yards
          south of red and 8 yards north of C4. This again is technically a
          double target from somewhere on B Baulk, but given the distance
          between red and black, is easily missed and will leave your black ball
          a shot of only 8 yards.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / max distance
              ball
            


Response to C4 ball after EB opening

          This opening creates one of the more interesting third-turn decisions.
          A second-turn ball 6" north of C4 is a very threatening position and
          therefore the options will as follows:
        


            Shoot at partner
            
Hit - set a dream leave

                Miss - leaves yellow a 13-yard shot at red in C4 for a 4-ball
                break
              



            Shoot at opponent near C4 from A baulk
            

                Hit - set a dream leave (you may want to have a go at gaining a
                rush to H1 on partner)
              

                Miss - leave a 13-yard double for yellow (but slightly tricky
                break pick-up)
              



            Join up with opponent near C4, leaving no double
            

                If red is 3-6" north of C4 - join a yard north of it from A
                baulk
                
No short double target is left for yellow

                    Yellow still only has a 13-yard shot for the innings (but a
                    slightly tricky break pick-up)
                  



                If red is ~12" north of C4 - shoot from C3 through to C4
                

                    Enables black to have a shot (albeit very long) to attempt
                    to hit and set a dream leave
                  




Black to C2


              By burying itself in C2, this enables black to kill off the
              aggression by red and yellow. Any miss by yellow will leave a 9
              yarder (at most) for blue
            






              Some common third-ball responses to a C4 ball
            



          A personal preference of mine is to shoot third-turn at the ball near
          C4 from A baulk, because hitting gives me control of the court, and I
          miss often enough by more than several inches so as not to leave a
          double.
        

          Be on the lookout for cannons around C4 as part of this opening -
          there is often a good opportunity to bombard a live ball across to H1
          while playing a croquet stroke towards blue on the east boundary. This
          can make picking up the first break a great deal easier.
        
Response to duffer tice after EB opening

          The duffer tice is one of my favourite openings. Because of the
          placement of red near H6, a miss by black from the end of B baulk will
          be headed towards A baulk and give an easy start for yellow. That is
          why we see the ~9 yard shot at red refused so often, even by very
          strong players!
        

          If black does decide to shoot at the duffer and hits, then not a great
          deal of options are available other than to take off to partner ball
          (usually nudging red towards the peg in the process), and leave a rush
          towards red, and then hope for a fourth-turn miss by yellow.
        

          Another option for shooting at the duffer is doing so from C3,
          shooting across the court and missing to around peg-high (or just
          south of peg-high) on the west boundary. This is the most defensive
          shot available in that a miss gives no break to yellow if yellow hits
          red, but it also does not put any pressure on yellow's shot at red.
          Often times, when black misses the shot from C3 at red, it will end up
          south of peg-high on the west boundary and be a tempting free shot for
          yellow from C1.
        

          Shooting at partner ball on turn 3 is the most aggressive line of play
          - taking the shot from A baulk and hitting gives the opportunity to
          play a big croquet stroke loading partner to H2 and attempting to get
          a rush to H1 on the duffer ball - it is a big shot and the break
          chances are normally only reasonable for very strong players. Missing
          partner from A baulk on the other hand gives yellow a ~9 yard shot and
          very strong break prospects. It is therefore more usual to see black
          shoot at blue from C3 which, although longer, doesn't make all the
          balls available to yellow if black misses blue and yellow hits red. It
          also means that blue and black maintain a wide join and have realistic
          prospects of hitting back in if yellow misses red.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a duffer tice
            


Response to 2 balls on EB

          If red has shot at blue on turn 2 and missed, leaving both balls on
          the east boundary, you should carefully evaluate your response based
          on the strength of your opponent. If you and your opponent are evenly
          matched but not world class players, or especially if your opponent is
          a much stronger player than you, then the best thing to do here may be
          to simply ignore the two balls on the east boundary and lag black into
          the middle of the court and wait for yellow to miss. This potentially
          presents you with an immediate break with a ball in the middle of the
          court.
        

          In a match between two very strong players it would be unusual to see
          no shot taken on turn 3, and if hit, some attempt at digging out a
          3-ball break.
        
Response to 2 balls in-court

          In a situation where you have laid a supershot with blue, and red has
          lagged a couple of yards north east of your supershot ball, if there
          is no double target to be had from anywhere on the baulk lines, you
          must again consider your expectations after hitting third turn vs your
          opponent's likelihood of hitting fourth turn. As with previous
          options, if you are playing an opponent who on paper is a much
          stronger player, the percentage play is usually to lag the black ball
          into the middle of the court beside the other two balls (being mindful
          not to leave a double target from anywhere), which will put pressure
          on your stronger opponent to hit in or else concede the first break
          opportunity to you.
        

          If you do want to shoot with black at one of the balls in the middle,
          then consider either shooting at the easterly ball from C1 (you may
          even be able to shoot hard at this without missing to B baulk), or
          alternatively shooting at a medium pace at either blue or red from the
          closest point on A baulk. If you do shoot from the closest point, be
          sure to hit at a pace to finish slightly south of H6, both so that
          black is not a short shot from B baulk, and so that any double target
          that you leave has plenty of space between the front and back ball.
        

          If you are facing a third turn shot with black after red has
          cross-wired blue and red at the peg, check first to see if there is a
          point which you can lag to where blue won't be wired from black, and
          which won't be giving a double target from either baulk line - if
          there is such a spot, then that is the best place to lag to.

 Fourth Ball Options
      

The fourth-turn response is usually actually more simple than then third-turn response - although there are more possible scenarios, they almost always result in yellow trying to roquet something.  
      

Response to ignored WB tice
When black has ignored a standard west boundary tice and insetad shot at (and missed) partner on the east boundary, the obvious response is to then try and hit red yourself from C1.  If the placement of red is good, you should have ~50% chance of hitting in.  Your break prospects after hitting red are actually quite good, as you will play a take off from red to blue & black, which will automatically be sending red towards H2 as a pioneer.  On the other hand, a miss with yellow through red into C2 only gives fairly mediocre break prospects to blue & black in the next turn.
Response to missed WB tice
If black did indeed shoot at red (and miss) from C1 in the previous turn, then the obvious response is to shoot at red yourself, but from a point east of C1 so that a miss will leave yellow joined with red.  If you hit red, your best line of play would be to roll red &  yellow towards C1 and lay a rush for your next turn.  A miss from red at yellow will of course leave black a shot through red and yellow from C2 to C1 but is likely to be a very long shot at a single ball target.  A miss from black on turn 5 here also gives you a good chance at establishing a break on turn 5.  




              If black has missed the standard tice, it leaves a good opportunity to join up with red on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C2 ball after EB opening
Having played red into C2 on turn 2, if black ignores red and simply joins with blue (which is likely), then against most players your best line of play would be to shoot at blue and black with red.  Whether you shoot from A baulk or B baulk depends on factors such as the distance between blue and black (whether it is easy to make a double target from B baulk or A baulk) and the flatness of the east boundary.  If the black ball missed blue badly on the left on turn 3, blue and black may well be 2+ yards apart on the east boundary, so there is a defensive option available to yellow as well - shoot from C3 through to C4, where a miss would not give blue & black any easy opening.
If you are the weaker player against a very strong opponent, then there is a case for shooting yellow at red - at 13 yards, it is significantly shorter than any other available shot and is therefore your best chance at winning the opening.  Red missing yellow gives blue a relatively easy start and a probable break, but against a very strong opponent it can still be worth the risk.  




              Fourth-turn responses for yellow when partner is in C2 and opponent balls are on the east boundary.  
            


Response to joined / missed C2 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, if black has for some reason shot at red in C2, then assuming a double target has been left, your best aggressive option is to shoot at this, preferably hitting the northern ball, from B baulk.  A hit or a miss here will give fairly good break prospects to whomever plays the next shot, given C2's proximity to H2 - a semi-good pioneer can usually be sent to H2 while obtaining a rush to H1.
If black has instead joined up a yard south of red on turn 2, you have no double target (except from C1, but let's not consider that).  Now you have fundamentally two options - either shoot yellow at red which will give a good break opportunity if hit (and concede a good break opportunity to black if missed), or take a more defensive line by shooting yellow at blue from C3 into C4.  If yellow misses this shot, it does give black a 1-yard roquet at red for the innings, however it not only gives no break prospects, but also requires black to play several good strokes in order to have a good leave.  Black's take off from C2 to blue on the east boundary is a difficult shot, and if black doesn't succeed in roqueting blue in its next shot (either taking off short and missing blue, or taking off too far and sending black out) then yellow will have a 9-10 yard shot at blue & black from near C4.




              If black has joined a yard south of red near C2, the yellow has aggressive and defensive options available
            


Response to missed EB ball after Supershot opening
The response here depends a lot on both the length of the supershot ball and what option black chose on turn 3.  Firstly let's assume the most common scenario, with blue halfway between H5 and peg, and 1-2 yards west of the centre line, and red approximately peg high on the EB, and black in or near C4.  In this situation the best option is normally to shoot at red from A baulk, with a miss joining up around 1 yard north of it.  This leaves blue a 15-yarder at red & yellow but difficult break prospects for both players, whomever plays the next shot. 




              The common response after a third-turn miss by black at red to C4, is for yellow to shoot at red, joining if missing.  An aggressive line is to shoot at black.  A third option is yellow at blue, which is shorter and will win you the innings, but only gives good break prospects if red and black are near to each other
            


As the weaker player against a stronger player, a very aggressive line of play would be to shoot yellow from A baulk at black in C4 - this is very black and white, as a hit will give you a good chance for a 4-ball break and a miss will give black the same chance.  As the weaker player, you can strongly consider this option.  
Consider for a moment that black's third-turn shot missed red from A baulk, or perhaps missed red from west of C3, finishing 5-10 yards south of red.  In this case, yellow for look for possible double targets available from B baulk.  Consider, too, the shortest shot available, which is yellow at blue from A baulk - this is likely a 11-13 yard shot which, if hit, gives good break prospects to yellow because red and black are close together.
Response to ignored duffer tice
The vast majority of the time the best response to black ignoring red's duffer tice, is for yellow to shoot hard at red from B baulk.  Usually a duffer tice is only 9-10 yards and so it will be, by far, the shortest shot for yellow.




              The majority of the time, the fourth turn response would be to shoot yellow at the duffer.  Against a very strong player, you might be tempted by yellow at black in C4 which, although 3 yards longer, gives an easy start to your break
            


An expection to this would be if blue & black are joined on the east boundary leaving a good double target from A baulk, and so you may want to consider shooting at that instead.  Another option to consider is if black shot and missed blue from C3 to C4.  If you are playing against a much stronger opponent you may consider shooting yellow at black from A baulk into C4.  This shot is 3 yards longer than yellow at red from B baulk, but hitting this shot gives you vastly stronger break prospects than if you hit red first.
Response to missed duffer tice
If black misses the duffer tice (red) gently, the logical response is to shoot hard at either red from B baulk or black from A baulk (whichever is closer).  If black misses the duffer tice from C3 across to the west boundary, you may consider shooting at black from C1 through to C2, particularly if black is south of peg-high.  




              If the duffer tice is still in its original position at the start of turn 4, the general response is for yellow to shoot at red given its proximity to B baulk.  If black missed red from C3 however, it can be tempting to shoot at black from C1 on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C4 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, red a few inches north of C4 and black 1 yard north of blue, yellow's default response should be to shoot at red from A baulk.  Hitting this shot gives a great break opportunity, as it is a very natural stroke to croquet red to H2 while approaching blue & black up the east boundary.  
Response to 3 balls on EB
In this instance, you simply need to hit one of the balls on the east boundary - from either A baulk or B baulk, depending on length and available targets.
Response to 3 balls in-court
A supershot opening with lags by red and black essentially forces yellow to shoot at the closest ball.  A very black and white opening, good break prospects for both players on turn 4 or 5, depending on whether yellow hits or misses.  Often times, black will have take a gentle lag while attempting a roquet at either blue or red on turn 3, so this may also give yellow some target to shoot at on turn 4.

Conclusion
If you have gotten to the bottom of this article, you have probably realised by now that the number of opening options are vast.  This article could not hope to cover every eventuality, and nor does it present any new or unseen openings; rather it serves to talk through the options and thought processes for choosing a particular option, and I hope it has been useful.

Openings

        The opening is the battle between the two sides to be the first to gain
        the upper hand. Generally when we talk about openings in croquet, we are
        referring to the first 4 turns. At the very top level it is where games
        are won and lost, but at all levels it provides a fascinating array of
        options for bluffing and double-bluffing your opponent.
      
Opening priorities
As the stronger player

        The stronger player who is playing a dangerous but less experienced /
        weaker player will generally approach the opening with the intent of not
        giving away an easy break, and hence a more defensive mindset. Openings
        where there is a lot of grey area, balls on boundaries and in corners
        are best for this. The stronger player will generally rely on their
        better all-round game in order to win, and is more comfortable with
        digging balls out slowly into a break.
      
As the weaker player

        The weaker player should approach a game against a much stronger
        opponent with an attacking mindset - they will not be afraid to take on
        relatively short shots that give laid breaks, even if it means conceding
        a laid break if they miss. The weaker player should favour openings that
        have balls in-lawn and should be looking to put pressure on the stronger
        player to have to hit in.
      
Evenly-matched players

        It is quite common to see very aggressive, black and white, openings
        when two very strong players play against each other. The same is true
        for openings between evenly-matched players at lower levels, but
        generally to a lesser extent. A lot of the opening strategy depends on
        the individual mindset of the player, with some players naturally
        playing a more attacking game than others.
      

        Below are articles on various well-known (and some not-so-well-known)
        openings, which discuss options for placement of balls, and responses to
        them. For the purposes of simplicity, in the examples below, the balls
        will always be played in the following order:
      


 Blue
        

 Red
        


          Black
        


          Yellow
        


Note: there is no ball order or sequence in which the balls need to
          be added to the game in croquet - the above order is simply to keep
          things consistent for the diagrams and explanations.


        As you can probably imagine, the options in the opening are endless.
        This article attempts to talk through some of the most common options,
        and some of the most common responses to them, with the idea of
        clarifying some of the thought processes behind them.
      

The Dream Leave

        Many of the openings below will reference something known as the Dream
        Leave - this is a scenario where the third turn ball (black) has hit and
        arranged the court as follows:
      




            Black hit on turn 3 and set a dream leave
          



        Black has retrieved red from wherever it was on the court and placed it
        slightly in-lawn from the west boundary, north of peg-high, and left
        blue a rush to it from the east boundary. This leave gives no short shot
        for yellow, and any miss by yellow will give blue a good break
        opportunity.

 First
        Ball Options
      

East Boundary

          The most common option selected by the first ball player. A ball to
          the east boundary, somewhere between level with H4 and H5, is chosen
          due to its relative distance from both baulk lines and from H1. It is
          a completely non-threatening ball and allows the second ball player to
          dictate the nature of the game, be it defensive or aggressive.
        
In-lawn East Boundary ball

          A variation on the standard east boundary ball, the in-lawn east
          boundary ball is struck out in the same area as the standard east
          boundary ball, but purposefully left about 1 yard in from the yardline
          area. The idea behind that is so that black can play its third turn
          shot out behind blue and leave itself a rush in-court. This play
          discourages responses like a west boundary tice from red.
        
Supershot

          A supershot ball is a first-turn ball placed near the middle of the
          court, normally between H5 and peg and a couple of yards west of the
          centre line. This is the most aggressive sensible option for the first
          ball, and signals your intent to your opponent that you want no grey
          area. Given its proximity to H1, a supershot ball generally gives a
          good chance for a break for either player, depending on whether the
          third-turn, fourth-turn or fifth-turn shots are hit.
        

          There are variations on the length of the supershot, with a supershot
          played to near the peg being a poorer pioneer for H1 but having the
          advantage of lengthening any fourth-turn shot by yellow at it.
        
Anti-duffer

          This opening is an attempt to try and pre-empt the second-turn
          response and discourage a "duffer tice" by red. To lay an anti-duffer,
          you hit blue to a spot somewhere between H6 and the peg, and 1-2 yards
          west of the east boundary. The idea of placing a ball here is that if
          the opponent were to lay a duffer tice with red,
          then it gives black a good chance to hit red and take off behind blue
          for a rush to H1 on turn 3. It is a leave that is generally only used
          by strong players who have a realistic chance of a third-turn break in
          the first place.
        




              Some common first-ball scenarios
            


Unusual first-turn options

          The croquet court is a big place and so there really are endless
          options for where to place balls in the opening. Often an unusual
          option first-turn will yield good results by confusing the opponent!
        
C4 first ball

          Not often seen these days due to a preference for an east boundary
          ball 10 yards further north. A weakness of this opening is that
          shooting at partner on turn 3 and missing is liable to leave a double
          target for yellow. It also generally encourages yellow to take an
          aggressive shot on turn 4; however on a difficult lawn this opening
          can have some advantages, with any hit by yellow on turn 4 at balls in
          C4 leaving little room to promote balls into the court due to the
          close proximity to the corner.
        
C2 first ball

          Playing blue into C2 first turn can often catch the opponent off
          guard. This opening attempts to flip the tables on red and yellow by
          trying to ensure a defensive opening for blue and black. This can be a
          good option where blue and black are the stronger players and want to
          prevent aggressive second-turn options by red and yellow. Of course,
          there are options available to red and yellow which negate blue and
          black's defensive preferences.
        
Micro tice

          As unusual options go, this is right up there. This option would not
          be recommended when playing a strong player, but nevertheless is very
          interesting. The micro tice is a ball played from the end of A baulk
          towards the east boundary, but only 2-3 yards towards it, leaving a
          2-3 yard roquet for the opponent on the second turn. This length of
          shot cannot really be refused, but leaving red a croquet stroke from
          south-west of hoop 4 on the second turn of the game gives no real
          break prospects. Often the second turn player will attempt an approach
          to H1 and fail it, leaving a 6-yard roquet with two balls near H1 for
          black. This opening relies more on a tactical mistake from red than
          anything else
        
C1 / C3 opening

          Occasionally seen. Not a good opening against any experienced
          opponent, but occasionally yields results. This first-turn option is
          not to be recommended. A first-turn ball in C1 followed by a
          second-turn response to C3 (or vice versa) is a killer blow to black's
          turn.

 Second
        Ball Options
      


          This is where things start to get a little interesting. For the most
          part, the opening is dictated by the second ball response, and there
          are many more options available.
        
Response to East Boundary ball
Standard Tice

          The standard tice is one of the most popular responses to an east
          boundary ball at club-level croquet. Although in recent years it has
          fallen out of favour with top players (likely due to an increase in
          the standard of shooting), it is still a great opening that gives good
          chances to both sides.
        

          The standard tice is where red is played to the west boundary, and the
          distance it is placed north of C1 needs to be carefully considered by
          the striker or red. The name "tice" indicates that the distance should
          be enticing for the player of black to shoot at and so a distance of
          between about 8 and 13 yards is common. As a general rule, if possible
          the distance chosen should either be about 1 yard longer than the
          opponent's critical distance (the distance at which someone hits 50%
          of their shots) or 1 yard shorter (or equal to) your own critical
          distance. Obviously this cannot be achieved if your opponent has a
          longer critical distance than you do, so it is better to err slightly
          on the longer side.
        

          If blue is an in-lawn east boundary ball, laying a standard tice is
          risky, as black can quite easily lay a rush directly to it on the
          third turn.
        
C2 ball

          Probably the most common response to the east boundary ball today is
          the second-turn ball to 6" south of C2. The reason for playing just
          south of C2 is that if in the unlikely event of black shooting at red
          on turn 3, a miss will likely leave yellow a double target. The idea
          of red near C2 means that red is buried in a defensive position, and
          signals yellow's intent to shoot at blue and black on turn 4.
        

          If blue is slightly in-lawn, then C2 is the safest and most defensive
          response with red.
        
Duffer tice

          One of the more aggressive responses for red is the duffer tice. This
          is a ball that is placed usually about 2-feet north and a few inches
          east of penultimate. This is similarly enticing for the opponent to
          shoot (just as with a standard tice) but in this case a miss is
          usually more critical - any third turn shot at the duffer is in the
          direction of A baulk so black usually takes the shot gently - and by
          doing so is more likely to miss. Black missing leaves two balls in the
          centre of the court, giving yellow a great chance on turn 4. The
          duffer tice is a great option for weaker players playing against
          stronger players, and also for anyone confident in hitting 10 yarders.
        

          Between two very strong players a duffer tice is still a popular
          opening. There are variations on the placement of the ball near
          penult, based on the strength of the opponent. It is common to see a
          duffer tice placed level with, or south of, H6, particularly if the
          striker of red and yellow is a very good shot and is confident to hit
          an 11-yarder on turn 4. In a game between experts, the placement of
          red is sometimes moved to the west of H6 to discourage a third-turn
          break after a hit from black at blue.
        
C4 ball

          This option is very popular in New Zealand and although a mirror image
          of the C2 ball, is a lot more aggressive. Placing red 6" north of C4
          not only gives negligible break prospects to black on turn 3 but also
          signals your intent to hit fourth-turn with yellow and have a break. A
          miss at partner by black on turn 3 gives you a 13-yard shot for a
          4-ball break, and a miss by black at red on turn 3 usually gives a
          double target.
        
Shoot at first-turn ball

          A slightly counter-intuitive option but nonetheless an interesting
          one. Shooting red at blue on turn 2 and hitting gives no break
          prospects, but a miss also leaves very slim break prospects for black
          on turn 3 if it hits, unless black is a very strong player. With this
          opening it is quite common to see misses on both turns 2 and 3, and
          often a triple target for yellow at the other 3 balls on turn 4 from B
          baulk.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to east boundary opening
            


Response to Supershot ball

          The supershot ball is the most aggressive opening that the first-turn
          player can use. There are several responses to this which need to be
          considered, based on your assessment of your opponent's ability and
          whether the opponent has realistic prospects of a break to 4-back if
          they do manage to hit 3rd turn.
        
C2 response

          The C2 response is a ball played about 6" south of C2. This is a
          strong response to a supershot against almost all players. If the
          player of black wants to attempt a third-turn break, they will have to
          hit a 13-yarder and play a very difficult croquet stroke out of C2 to
          get a rush to H1, and this is by no means guaranteed. On the other
          hand, a miss by black at red on turn 3 will leave yellow a double
          target and a 4-ball break if hit.
        




              It is important to finish a few inches south of C2 with red as it
              will mean black missing on either side of it will leave a double
              target. Above is a comparison of yellow's target after a
              third-turn miss by black at red, firstly with red in C2 and
              secondly with red a few inches south of C2
            



          There are only a handful of players in the world where the C2 ball is
          not a great response - players who would expect to hit the 13 yarder
          most of the time and also be good enough at croquet strokes to expect
          to get a rush to H1 on the supershot ball. Against these players the
          strategy of lengthing the 3rd turn shot would be preferred.
        
C4 response

          Mirror image to the C2 response, this ball is played 6" north of C4.
          Consider this if blue (the supershot ball) is placed further north
          than normal (somewhere near peg-high), or is in a particular spot
          which may have H4 obscuring any croquet stroke from C4 towards it. It
          otherwise gives all the same advantages as the C2 response
        
Max Distance response

          As a counter to the very top players hitting the ball in C2 most of
          the time, the max distance response became popular - this is where red
          is played to the east boundary about level with the peg on the east
          boundary, leaving the longest shot possible for black. This response
          grants black a shot from C3 through red and into C4, reducing yellow's
          fourth-turn prospects - it relies more on black missing red than
          trying to make any break pick-up by black more difficult. Generally a
          good option against the very best players, but against most players is
          unnecessary.  
The reason why max distance on the east boundary is chosen instead of the equivalent max distance spot on the west boundary is that it is slightly further from the supershot ball (blue), which is slightly south-west of the peg.  Assuming that the shots on turns 3 and 4 are missed, blue's shot at red & yellow on the east boundary will be a couple of yards longer than the equivalent shot to the west boundary.  
Supershot lag

          The response for red to lag to a spot 3-4 yards east and 1-2 yards
          north of the supershot ball is a very strong and very under-used
          response to the supershot. This is a good tactic when playing someone
          who is a very good shot, and in particular if the supershot ball
          itself is quite deep (nearer the peg than H5). Placing red beside blue
          nullifies the strength of black's shooting by encouraging black to
          take its third turn shot gently (which is generally less accurate), or
          risk shooting hard and missing into B baulk, conceding a 4-ball break.
          In this case, black may choose not to shoot at all, and instead also
          lag to a position wide of the other two balls, meaning that red and
          yellow have successfully turned the tables of the supershot opening
          and enabled yellow to have the first attempted roquet.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to supershot opening
            


Roquet the Supershot ball

          The ultimate way to nullify the supershot ball - roquet it on the
          second turn. After roqueting blue with red, there are several options
          available. You can croquet blue towards C2 and then fire red off 6"
          north of C4. A more aggressive option would be to croquet blue
          north-west of H2 and fire red off the south boundary, south of H4 -
          this leaves black a choice of 7-8 yarders but minimal break prospects
          and difficult strokes with their third turn in order to distance the
          balls from baulk. A more novel option would be to crosswire blue and
          red at the peg, which leaves only a 17-yard shot for black with a
          baulk line in the background. An even more interesting option might be
          to roll blue close to the peg, either east or west, and then play red
          a yard or two away from it, wiring blue's backswing at red. This means
          that black probably has no lag option towards blue that doesn't leave
          a double-target for yellow.
        
Response to unusual first-turn options
Response to a first-turn C2 ball

          A first-turn C2 ball is an attempt by blue to make red conform to a
          defensive opening. Red could of course do this if it wants, by playing
          6" north of C4, or even by just having a "standard" east boundary
          ball; however a better option to negate blue's attempt at dictating
          the opening might be to set a duffer tice - this is the ultimate
          aggressive response to the C2 ball, and means that black is suddenly
          faced with having to hit a 10-13 yarder on turn 3 or risk leaving the
          same for yellow next turn, and a laid break.
        
Back to top



 Third
        Ball Options
      

        For the vast majority of players, if they manage to hit in on the third
        turn of the game, they will and should be looking to make a dream leave
        (see top of page) or similar, possibly with red near the peg and blue &
        black with a rush towards it. There are exceptions to this line of play,
        mainly with supershot openings, but unless otherwise stated, the
        standard play would be to try and set a dream leave.
      

Response to WB tice after EB opening

          Realistically, black will not be attempting to make any break on turn
          3 if it manages to hit in. The player of black has to make a judgement
          call on their likelihood of hitting the standard tice vs their
          opponent's likelihood of missing it.
        


            If the tice is long, the best response is probably to shoot black at
            blue from A baulk. Missing black at blue leaves the free shot at the
            tice for yellow of course, which does give yellow fairly good
            prospects if hit. If the tice is extremely long, say peg-high, then
            black could quite feasibly just lag at blue and attempt to leave a
            rush to red. Bear in mind that playing this lag so early in the game
            may be difficult as you may not have the pace of the court - and
            there is a risk that lagging at blue and falling short will leave
            yellow a double target on turn 4.
          

            Another option if black is uncertain, would be to shoot at blue from
            C3, and missing through to C4. This hedges black's bets somewhat, as
            it is still taking a shot at a ball and still somewhat joining with
            partner ball, but does not give good break prospects to the opponent
            if yellow hits, due to the proximity of blue and black to one
            another. Yellow is faced with a long takeoff from red towards blue
            and black and in all likelihood will not get a rush to H1 from this
            position.
          

            The third option is of course to shoot at the tice itself. Hitting
            red will give the opportunity to make a dream leave (as shown at the
            top of the page). Missing red will send black towards C2, which will
            give black a free shot back through red and yellow if yellow misses
            its fourth-turn shot at red.
          





              Some common third-ball responses to a standard tice
            


Response to C2 ball after EB opening

          There are two common options after a second-turn C2 ball - both
          consist of shooting at partner. If partner is hit, then usually the
          play will be to take off to the red in C2, roquet it and then croquet
          it either into the centre of the court, or along the west boundary,
          then lag back to partner and leave a rush in-court. However, consider
          a game where you are the stronger player playing a very capable weaker
          player, if you do hit partner third turn, you can elect to just set a
          rush to the C2 ball instead of trying to retrieve it from C2. As the
          stronger player you may prefer this line of play, instead of digging
          out the C2 ball only for your opponent to hit on turn 4 and have an
          easy break.
        

          Usually the third-turn shot at partner with black will be from A
          baulk, joining up on the east boundary if missed. This leaves a long
          double target for yellow from the end of B baulk. A more defensive
          play would be to shoot at partner from C3 into C4. Doing this leaves
          almost no break prospects fourth-turn for yellow but, depending on the
          distance between blue and black, may give them the opportunity to join
          up.
        

          Another option for black on turn 3 would be to shoot at red in C2 -
          however usually this is only a viable option if red is exactly in the
          corner, as it will mean that missing red on the right leaves no double
          target for yellow. Alternatively, another option would be for black to
          join up with red near C2, about 3-4 feet south of it. Doing so leaves
          no double target from B baulk and gives good break prospects to black
          if yellow misses the 13 yarder, although it must be remembered that
          yellow also has good prospects if it hits the 13 yarder. Black joining
          up with red also leaves a defensive shot for yellow at blue from C3 to
          C4 which, if missed, leaves black a very long and tricky takeoff from
          C2 to the east boundary.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a C2 ball
            


Response to C2 / C4 ball after Supershot opening

          The third-turn response to this option depends greatly on your ability
          and also the ability of your opponent. Before you lay the supershot,
          you need to ask yourself "am I realistically good enough to play a
          third-turn break to 4-back?". If the answer is no, then that does not
          mean that the supershot opening is a bad idea at all, but it just
          means that you may want to reassess your third-turn response.
          Additionally, if you are playing someone that you believe is much
          better than you are, then trying to give yourself a 4-ball break on
          turn 5 is exactly what you should be trying to achieve. Therefore,
          instead of trying to roquet the 13 yard shot of black at red just
          south of C2 (or just north of C4), you can instead look to join up
          with the ball 3-4 feet away, ensuring to leave no double target. This
          puts a great deal of pressure on your stronger opponent to then hit a
          13 yarder or else concede a 4-ball break to you.
        

          If you believe you are good enough to hit on turn 3 and play a break,
          then the answer is simple - hit red near C2 and go round.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / C2 ball
            


Response to EB ball after Supershot opening

          In most cases, the third-turn response to a max distance ball is to
          try and hit it from C3, missing into C4. Again, however, you should
          evaluate your own likelihood of playing a break to 4-back with only 3
          balls on the lawn if you hit, and so you may want to consider lagging
          to the ball, a couple of yards in-lawn from the east boundary.
        

          If the ball on the east boundary is south of the peg, it is tempting
          to simply shoot at it from A baulk. Missing will of course leave a
          double from B baulk, but the odds of yellow then hitting a double
          target from 20+ yards is no certainty. Alternatively, if the
          second-turn ball is around peg-high, then shooting at it from B baulk
          from a few yards west of C3 and missing often results in a fairly even
          spread of the balls, with your black ball being approximately 8 yards
          south of red and 8 yards north of C4. This again is technically a
          double target from somewhere on B Baulk, but given the distance
          between red and black, is easily missed and will leave your black ball
          a shot of only 8 yards.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / max distance
              ball
            


Response to C4 ball after EB opening

          This opening creates one of the more interesting third-turn decisions.
          A second-turn ball 6" north of C4 is a very threatening position and
          therefore the options will as follows:
        


            Shoot at partner
            
Hit - set a dream leave

                Miss - leaves yellow a 13-yard shot at red in C4 for a 4-ball
                break
              



            Shoot at opponent near C4 from A baulk
            

                Hit - set a dream leave (you may want to have a go at gaining a
                rush to H1 on partner)
              

                Miss - leave a 13-yard double for yellow (but slightly tricky
                break pick-up)
              



            Join up with opponent near C4, leaving no double
            

                If red is 3-6" north of C4 - join a yard north of it from A
                baulk
                
No short double target is left for yellow

                    Yellow still only has a 13-yard shot for the innings (but a
                    slightly tricky break pick-up)
                  



                If red is ~12" north of C4 - shoot from C3 through to C4
                

                    Enables black to have a shot (albeit very long) to attempt
                    to hit and set a dream leave
                  




Black to C2


              By burying itself in C2, this enables black to kill off the
              aggression by red and yellow. Any miss by yellow will leave a 9
              yarder (at most) for blue
            






              Some common third-ball responses to a C4 ball
            



          A personal preference of mine is to shoot third-turn at the ball near
          C4 from A baulk, because hitting gives me control of the court, and I
          miss often enough by more than several inches so as not to leave a
          double.
        

          Be on the lookout for cannons around C4 as part of this opening -
          there is often a good opportunity to bombard a live ball across to H1
          while playing a croquet stroke towards blue on the east boundary. This
          can make picking up the first break a great deal easier.
        
Response to duffer tice after EB opening

          The duffer tice is one of my favourite openings. Because of the
          placement of red near H6, a miss by black from the end of B baulk will
          be headed towards A baulk and give an easy start for yellow. That is
          why we see the ~9 yard shot at red refused so often, even by very
          strong players!
        

          If black does decide to shoot at the duffer and hits, then not a great
          deal of options are available other than to take off to partner ball
          (usually nudging red towards the peg in the process), and leave a rush
          towards red, and then hope for a fourth-turn miss by yellow.
        

          Another option for shooting at the duffer is doing so from C3,
          shooting across the court and missing to around peg-high (or just
          south of peg-high) on the west boundary. This is the most defensive
          shot available in that a miss gives no break to yellow if yellow hits
          red, but it also does not put any pressure on yellow's shot at red.
          Often times, when black misses the shot from C3 at red, it will end up
          south of peg-high on the west boundary and be a tempting free shot for
          yellow from C1.
        

          Shooting at partner ball on turn 3 is the most aggressive line of play
          - taking the shot from A baulk and hitting gives the opportunity to
          play a big croquet stroke loading partner to H2 and attempting to get
          a rush to H1 on the duffer ball - it is a big shot and the break
          chances are normally only reasonable for very strong players. Missing
          partner from A baulk on the other hand gives yellow a ~9 yard shot and
          very strong break prospects. It is therefore more usual to see black
          shoot at blue from C3 which, although longer, doesn't make all the
          balls available to yellow if black misses blue and yellow hits red. It
          also means that blue and black maintain a wide join and have realistic
          prospects of hitting back in if yellow misses red.

          If red has shot at blue on turn 2 and missed, leaving both balls on
          the east boundary, you should carefully evaluate your response based
          on the strength of your opponent. If you and your opponent are evenly
          matched but not world class players, or especially if your opponent is
          a much stronger player than you, then the best thing to do here may be
          to simply ignore the two balls on the east boundary and lag black into
          the middle of the court and wait for yellow to miss. This potentially
          presents you with an immediate break with a ball in the middle of the
          court.
        

          In a match between two very strong players it would be unusual to see
          no shot taken on turn 3, and if hit, some attempt at digging out a
          3-ball break.
        
Response to 2 balls in-court

          In a situation where you have laid a supershot with blue, and red has
          lagged a couple of yards north east of your supershot ball, if there
          is no double target to be had from anywhere on the baulk lines, you
          must again consider your expectations after hitting third turn vs your
          opponent's likelihood of hitting fourth turn. As with previous
          options, if you are playing an opponent who on paper is a much
          stronger player, the percentage play is usually to lag the black ball
          into the middle of the court beside the other two balls (being mindful
          not to leave a double target from anywhere), which will put pressure
          on your stronger opponent to hit in or else concede the first break
          opportunity to you.
        

          If you do want to shoot with black at one of the balls in the middle,
          then consider either shooting at the easterly ball from C1 (you may
          even be able to shoot hard at this without missing to B baulk), or
          alternatively shooting at a medium pace at either blue or red from the
          closest point on A baulk. If you do shoot from the closest point, be
          sure to hit at a pace to finish slightly south of H6, both so that
          black is not a short shot from B baulk, and so that any double target
          that you leave has plenty of space between the front and back ball.
        

          If you are facing a third turn shot with black after red has
          cross-wired blue and red at the peg, check first to see if there is a
          point which you can lag to where blue won't be wired from black, and
          which won't be giving a double target from either baulk line - if
          there is such a spot, then that is the best place to lag to.

 Fourth Ball Options
      

The fourth-turn response is usually actually more simple than then third-turn response - although there are more possible scenarios, they almost always result in yellow trying to roquet something.  
      

Response to ignored WB tice
When black has ignored a standard west boundary tice and insetad shot at (and missed) partner on the east boundary, the obvious response is to then try and hit red yourself from C1.  If the placement of red is good, you should have ~50% chance of hitting in.  Your break prospects after hitting red are actually quite good, as you will play a take off from red to blue & black, which will automatically be sending red towards H2 as a pioneer.  On the other hand, a miss with yellow through red into C2 only gives fairly mediocre break prospects to blue & black in the next turn.
Response to missed WB tice
If black did indeed shoot at red (and miss) from C1 in the previous turn, then the obvious response is to shoot at red yourself, but from a point east of C1 so that a miss will leave yellow joined with red.  If you hit red, your best line of play would be to roll red &  yellow towards C1 and lay a rush for your next turn.  A miss from red at yellow will of course leave black a shot through red and yellow from C2 to C1 but is likely to be a very long shot at a single ball target.  A miss from black on turn 5 here also gives you a good chance at establishing a break on turn 5.  




              If black has missed the standard tice, it leaves a good opportunity to join up with red on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C2 ball after EB opening
Having played red into C2 on turn 2, if black ignores red and simply joins with blue (which is likely), then against most players your best line of play would be to shoot at blue and black with red.  Whether you shoot from A baulk or B baulk depends on factors such as the distance between blue and black (whether it is easy to make a double target from B baulk or A baulk) and the flatness of the east boundary.  If the black ball missed blue badly on the left on turn 3, blue and black may well be 2+ yards apart on the east boundary, so there is a defensive option available to yellow as well - shoot from C3 through to C4, where a miss would not give blue & black any easy opening.
If you are the weaker player against a very strong opponent, then there is a case for shooting yellow at red - at 13 yards, it is significantly shorter than any other available shot and is therefore your best chance at winning the opening.  Red missing yellow gives blue a relatively easy start and a probable break, but against a very strong opponent it can still be worth the risk.  




              Fourth-turn responses for yellow when partner is in C2 and opponent balls are on the east boundary.  
            


Response to joined / missed C2 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, if black has for some reason shot at red in C2, then assuming a double target has been left, your best aggressive option is to shoot at this, preferably hitting the northern ball, from B baulk.  A hit or a miss here will give fairly good break prospects to whomever plays the next shot, given C2's proximity to H2 - a semi-good pioneer can usually be sent to H2 while obtaining a rush to H1.
If black has instead joined up a yard south of red on turn 2, you have no double target (except from C1, but let's not consider that).  Now you have fundamentally two options - either shoot yellow at red which will give a good break opportunity if hit (and concede a good break opportunity to black if missed), or take a more defensive line by shooting yellow at blue from C3 into C4.  If yellow misses this shot, it does give black a 1-yard roquet at red for the innings, however it not only gives no break prospects, but also requires black to play several good strokes in order to have a good leave.  Black's take off from C2 to blue on the east boundary is a difficult shot, and if black doesn't succeed in roqueting blue in its next shot (either taking off short and missing blue, or taking off too far and sending black out) then yellow will have a 9-10 yard shot at blue & black from near C4.




              If black has joined a yard south of red near C2, the yellow has aggressive and defensive options available
            


Response to missed EB ball after Supershot opening
The response here depends a lot on both the length of the supershot ball and what option black chose on turn 3.  Firstly let's assume the most common scenario, with blue halfway between H5 and peg, and 1-2 yards west of the centre line, and red approximately peg high on the EB, and black in or near C4.  In this situation the best option is normally to shoot at red from A baulk, with a miss joining up around 1 yard north of it.  This leaves blue a 15-yarder at red & yellow but difficult break prospects for both players, whomever plays the next shot. 




              The common response after a third-turn miss by black at red to C4, is for yellow to shoot at red, joining if missing.  An aggressive line is to shoot at black.  A third option is yellow at blue, which is shorter and will win you the innings, but only gives good break prospects if red and black are near to each other
            


As the weaker player against a stronger player, a very aggressive line of play would be to shoot yellow from A baulk at black in C4 - this is very black and white, as a hit will give you a good chance for a 4-ball break and a miss will give black the same chance.  As the weaker player, you can strongly consider this option.  
Consider for a moment that black's third-turn shot missed red from A baulk, or perhaps missed red from west of C3, finishing 5-10 yards south of red.  In this case, yellow for look for possible double targets available from B baulk.  Consider, too, the shortest shot available, which is yellow at blue from A baulk - this is likely a 11-13 yard shot which, if hit, gives good break prospects to yellow because red and black are close together.
Response to ignored duffer tice
The vast majority of the time the best response to black ignoring red's duffer tice, is for yellow to shoot hard at red from B baulk.  Usually a duffer tice is only 9-10 yards and so it will be, by far, the shortest shot for yellow.




              The majority of the time, the fourth turn response would be to shoot yellow at the duffer.  Against a very strong player, you might be tempted by yellow at black in C4 which, although 3 yards longer, gives an easy start to your break
            


An expection to this would be if blue & black are joined on the east boundary leaving a good double target from A baulk, and so you may want to consider shooting at that instead.  Another option to consider is if black shot and missed blue from C3 to C4.  If you are playing against a much stronger opponent you may consider shooting yellow at black from A baulk into C4.  This shot is 3 yards longer than yellow at red from B baulk, but hitting this shot gives you vastly stronger break prospects than if you hit red first.
Response to missed duffer tice
If black misses the duffer tice (red) gently, the logical response is to shoot hard at either red from B baulk or black from A baulk (whichever is closer).  If black misses the duffer tice from C3 across to the west boundary, you may consider shooting at black from C1 through to C2, particularly if black is south of peg-high.  




              If the duffer tice is still in its original position at the start of turn 4, the general response is for yellow to shoot at red given its proximity to B baulk.  If black missed red from C3 however, it can be tempting to shoot at black from C1 on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C4 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, red a few inches north of C4 and black 1 yard north of blue, yellow's default response should be to shoot at red from A baulk.  Hitting this shot gives a great break opportunity, as it is a very natural stroke to croquet red to H2 while approaching blue & black up the east boundary.  
Response to 3 balls on EB
In this instance, you simply need to hit one of the balls on the east boundary - from either A baulk or B baulk, depending on length and available targets.
Response to 3 balls in-court
A supershot opening with lags by red and black essentially forces yellow to shoot at the closest ball.  A very black and white opening, good break prospects for both players on turn 4 or 5, depending on whether yellow hits or misses.  Often times, black will have take a gentle lag while attempting a roquet at either blue or red on turn 3, so this may also give yellow some target to shoot at on turn 4.

Conclusion
If you have gotten to the bottom of this article, you have probably realised by now that the number of opening options are vast.  This article could not hope to cover every eventuality, and nor does it present any new or unseen openings; rather it serves to talk through the options and thought processes for choosing a particular option, and I hope it has been useful.

Openings

        The opening is the battle between the two sides to be the first to gain
        the upper hand. Generally when we talk about openings in croquet, we are
        referring to the first 4 turns. At the very top level it is where games
        are won and lost, but at all levels it provides a fascinating array of
        options for bluffing and double-bluffing your opponent.
      
Opening priorities
As the stronger player

        The stronger player who is playing a dangerous but less experienced /
        weaker player will generally approach the opening with the intent of not
        giving away an easy break, and hence a more defensive mindset. Openings
        where there is a lot of grey area, balls on boundaries and in corners
        are best for this. The stronger player will generally rely on their
        better all-round game in order to win, and is more comfortable with
        digging balls out slowly into a break.
      
As the weaker player

        The weaker player should approach a game against a much stronger
        opponent with an attacking mindset - they will not be afraid to take on
        relatively short shots that give laid breaks, even if it means conceding
        a laid break if they miss. The weaker player should favour openings that
        have balls in-lawn and should be looking to put pressure on the stronger
        player to have to hit in.
      
Evenly-matched players

        It is quite common to see very aggressive, black and white, openings
        when two very strong players play against each other. The same is true
        for openings between evenly-matched players at lower levels, but
        generally to a lesser extent. A lot of the opening strategy depends on
        the individual mindset of the player, with some players naturally
        playing a more attacking game than others.
      

        Below are articles on various well-known (and some not-so-well-known)
        openings, which discuss options for placement of balls, and responses to
        them. For the purposes of simplicity, in the examples below, the balls
        will always be played in the following order:
      


 Blue
        

 Red
        


          Black
        


          Yellow
        


Note: there is no ball order or sequence in which the balls need to
          be added to the game in croquet - the above order is simply to keep
          things consistent for the diagrams and explanations.


        As you can probably imagine, the options in the opening are endless.
        This article attempts to talk through some of the most common options,
        and some of the most common responses to them, with the idea of
        clarifying some of the thought processes behind them.
      

The Dream Leave

        Many of the openings below will reference something known as the Dream
        Leave - this is a scenario where the third turn ball (black) has hit and
        arranged the court as follows:
      




            Black hit on turn 3 and set a dream leave
          



        Black has retrieved red from wherever it was on the court and placed it
        slightly in-lawn from the west boundary, north of peg-high, and left
        blue a rush to it from the east boundary. This leave gives no short shot
        for yellow, and any miss by yellow will give blue a good break
        opportunity.

 First
        Ball Options
      

East Boundary

          The most common option selected by the first ball player. A ball to
          the east boundary, somewhere between level with H4 and H5, is chosen
          due to its relative distance from both baulk lines and from H1. It is
          a completely non-threatening ball and allows the second ball player to
          dictate the nature of the game, be it defensive or aggressive.
        
In-lawn East Boundary ball

          A variation on the standard east boundary ball, the in-lawn east
          boundary ball is struck out in the same area as the standard east
          boundary ball, but purposefully left about 1 yard in from the yardline
          area. The idea behind that is so that black can play its third turn
          shot out behind blue and leave itself a rush in-court. This play
          discourages responses like a west boundary tice from red.
        
Supershot

          A supershot ball is a first-turn ball placed near the middle of the
          court, normally between H5 and peg and a couple of yards west of the
          centre line. This is the most aggressive sensible option for the first
          ball, and signals your intent to your opponent that you want no grey
          area. Given its proximity to H1, a supershot ball generally gives a
          good chance for a break for either player, depending on whether the
          third-turn, fourth-turn or fifth-turn shots are hit.
        

          There are variations on the length of the supershot, with a supershot
          played to near the peg being a poorer pioneer for H1 but having the
          advantage of lengthening any fourth-turn shot by yellow at it.
        
Anti-duffer

          This opening is an attempt to try and pre-empt the second-turn
          response and discourage a "duffer tice" by red. To lay an anti-duffer,
          you hit blue to a spot somewhere between H6 and the peg, and 1-2 yards
          west of the east boundary. The idea of placing a ball here is that if
          the opponent were to lay a duffer tice with red,
          then it gives black a good chance to hit red and take off behind blue
          for a rush to H1 on turn 3. It is a leave that is generally only used
          by strong players who have a realistic chance of a third-turn break in
          the first place.
        




              Some common first-ball scenarios
            


Unusual first-turn options

          The croquet court is a big place and so there really are endless
          options for where to place balls in the opening. Often an unusual
          option first-turn will yield good results by confusing the opponent!
        
C4 first ball

          Not often seen these days due to a preference for an east boundary
          ball 10 yards further north. A weakness of this opening is that
          shooting at partner on turn 3 and missing is liable to leave a double
          target for yellow. It also generally encourages yellow to take an
          aggressive shot on turn 4; however on a difficult lawn this opening
          can have some advantages, with any hit by yellow on turn 4 at balls in
          C4 leaving little room to promote balls into the court due to the
          close proximity to the corner.
        
C2 first ball

          Playing blue into C2 first turn can often catch the opponent off
          guard. This opening attempts to flip the tables on red and yellow by
          trying to ensure a defensive opening for blue and black. This can be a
          good option where blue and black are the stronger players and want to
          prevent aggressive second-turn options by red and yellow. Of course,
          there are options available to red and yellow which negate blue and
          black's defensive preferences.
        
Micro tice

          As unusual options go, this is right up there. This option would not
          be recommended when playing a strong player, but nevertheless is very
          interesting. The micro tice is a ball played from the end of A baulk
          towards the east boundary, but only 2-3 yards towards it, leaving a
          2-3 yard roquet for the opponent on the second turn. This length of
          shot cannot really be refused, but leaving red a croquet stroke from
          south-west of hoop 4 on the second turn of the game gives no real
          break prospects. Often the second turn player will attempt an approach
          to H1 and fail it, leaving a 6-yard roquet with two balls near H1 for
          black. This opening relies more on a tactical mistake from red than
          anything else
        
C1 / C3 opening

          Occasionally seen. Not a good opening against any experienced
          opponent, but occasionally yields results. This first-turn option is
          not to be recommended. A first-turn ball in C1 followed by a
          second-turn response to C3 (or vice versa) is a killer blow to black's
          turn.
        
Back to top




 Second
        Ball Options
      


          This is where things start to get a little interesting. For the most
          part, the opening is dictated by the second ball response, and there
          are many more options available.
        
Response to East Boundary ball
Standard Tice

          The standard tice is one of the most popular responses to an east
          boundary ball at club-level croquet. Although in recent years it has
          fallen out of favour with top players (likely due to an increase in
          the standard of shooting), it is still a great opening that gives good
          chances to both sides.
        

          The standard tice is where red is played to the west boundary, and the
          distance it is placed north of C1 needs to be carefully considered by
          the striker or red. The name "tice" indicates that the distance should
          be enticing for the player of black to shoot at and so a distance of
          between about 8 and 13 yards is common. As a general rule, if possible
          the distance chosen should either be about 1 yard longer than the
          opponent's critical distance (the distance at which someone hits 50%
          of their shots) or 1 yard shorter (or equal to) your own critical
          distance. Obviously this cannot be achieved if your opponent has a
          longer critical distance than you do, so it is better to err slightly
          on the longer side.
        

          If blue is an in-lawn east boundary ball, laying a standard tice is
          risky, as black can quite easily lay a rush directly to it on the
          third turn.
        
C2 ball

          Probably the most common response to the east boundary ball today is
          the second-turn ball to 6" south of C2. The reason for playing just
          south of C2 is that if in the unlikely event of black shooting at red
          on turn 3, a miss will likely leave yellow a double target. The idea
          of red near C2 means that red is buried in a defensive position, and
          signals yellow's intent to shoot at blue and black on turn 4.
        

          If blue is slightly in-lawn, then C2 is the safest and most defensive
          response with red.
        
Duffer tice

          One of the more aggressive responses for red is the duffer tice. This
          is a ball that is placed usually about 2-feet north and a few inches
          east of penultimate. This is similarly enticing for the opponent to
          shoot (just as with a standard tice) but in this case a miss is
          usually more critical - any third turn shot at the duffer is in the
          direction of A baulk so black usually takes the shot gently - and by
          doing so is more likely to miss. Black missing leaves two balls in the
          centre of the court, giving yellow a great chance on turn 4. The
          duffer tice is a great option for weaker players playing against
          stronger players, and also for anyone confident in hitting 10 yarders.
        

          Between two very strong players a duffer tice is still a popular
          opening. There are variations on the placement of the ball near
          penult, based on the strength of the opponent. It is common to see a
          duffer tice placed level with, or south of, H6, particularly if the
          striker of red and yellow is a very good shot and is confident to hit
          an 11-yarder on turn 4. In a game between experts, the placement of
          red is sometimes moved to the west of H6 to discourage a third-turn
          break after a hit from black at blue.
        
C4 ball

          This option is very popular in New Zealand and although a mirror image
          of the C2 ball, is a lot more aggressive. Placing red 6" north of C4
          not only gives negligible break prospects to black on turn 3 but also
          signals your intent to hit fourth-turn with yellow and have a break. A
          miss at partner by black on turn 3 gives you a 13-yard shot for a
          4-ball break, and a miss by black at red on turn 3 usually gives a
          double target.
        
Shoot at first-turn ball

          A slightly counter-intuitive option but nonetheless an interesting
          one. Shooting red at blue on turn 2 and hitting gives no break
          prospects, but a miss also leaves very slim break prospects for black
          on turn 3 if it hits, unless black is a very strong player. With this
          opening it is quite common to see misses on both turns 2 and 3, and
          often a triple target for yellow at the other 3 balls on turn 4 from B
          baulk.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to east boundary opening
            


Response to Supershot ball

          The supershot ball is the most aggressive opening that the first-turn
          player can use. There are several responses to this which need to be
          considered, based on your assessment of your opponent's ability and
          whether the opponent has realistic prospects of a break to 4-back if
          they do manage to hit 3rd turn.
        
C2 response

          The C2 response is a ball played about 6" south of C2. This is a
          strong response to a supershot against almost all players. If the
          player of black wants to attempt a third-turn break, they will have to
          hit a 13-yarder and play a very difficult croquet stroke out of C2 to
          get a rush to H1, and this is by no means guaranteed. On the other
          hand, a miss by black at red on turn 3 will leave yellow a double
          target and a 4-ball break if hit.
        




              It is important to finish a few inches south of C2 with red as it
              will mean black missing on either side of it will leave a double
              target. Above is a comparison of yellow's target after a
              third-turn miss by black at red, firstly with red in C2 and
              secondly with red a few inches south of C2
            



          There are only a handful of players in the world where the C2 ball is
          not a great response - players who would expect to hit the 13 yarder
          most of the time and also be good enough at croquet strokes to expect
          to get a rush to H1 on the supershot ball. Against these players the
          strategy of lengthing the 3rd turn shot would be preferred.
        
C4 response

          Mirror image to the C2 response, this ball is played 6" north of C4.
          Consider this if blue (the supershot ball) is placed further north
          than normal (somewhere near peg-high), or is in a particular spot
          which may have H4 obscuring any croquet stroke from C4 towards it. It
          otherwise gives all the same advantages as the C2 response
        
Max Distance response

          As a counter to the very top players hitting the ball in C2 most of
          the time, the max distance response became popular - this is where red
          is played to the east boundary about level with the peg on the east
          boundary, leaving the longest shot possible for black. This response
          grants black a shot from C3 through red and into C4, reducing yellow's
          fourth-turn prospects - it relies more on black missing red than
          trying to make any break pick-up by black more difficult. Generally a
          good option against the very best players, but against most players is
          unnecessary.  
The reason why max distance on the east boundary is chosen instead of the equivalent max distance spot on the west boundary is that it is slightly further from the supershot ball (blue), which is slightly south-west of the peg.  Assuming that the shots on turns 3 and 4 are missed, blue's shot at red & yellow on the east boundary will be a couple of yards longer than the equivalent shot to the west boundary.  
Supershot lag

          The response for red to lag to a spot 3-4 yards east and 1-2 yards
          north of the supershot ball is a very strong and very under-used
          response to the supershot. This is a good tactic when playing someone
          who is a very good shot, and in particular if the supershot ball
          itself is quite deep (nearer the peg than H5). Placing red beside blue
          nullifies the strength of black's shooting by encouraging black to
          take its third turn shot gently (which is generally less accurate), or
          risk shooting hard and missing into B baulk, conceding a 4-ball break.
          In this case, black may choose not to shoot at all, and instead also
          lag to a position wide of the other two balls, meaning that red and
          yellow have successfully turned the tables of the supershot opening
          and enabled yellow to have the first attempted roquet.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to supershot opening
            


Roquet the Supershot ball

          The ultimate way to nullify the supershot ball - roquet it on the
          second turn. After roqueting blue with red, there are several options
          available. You can croquet blue towards C2 and then fire red off 6"
          north of C4. A more aggressive option would be to croquet blue
          north-west of H2 and fire red off the south boundary, south of H4 -
          this leaves black a choice of 7-8 yarders but minimal break prospects
          and difficult strokes with their third turn in order to distance the
          balls from baulk. A more novel option would be to crosswire blue and
          red at the peg, which leaves only a 17-yard shot for black with a
          baulk line in the background. An even more interesting option might be
          to roll blue close to the peg, either east or west, and then play red
          a yard or two away from it, wiring blue's backswing at red. This means
          that black probably has no lag option towards blue that doesn't leave
          a double-target for yellow.
        
Response to unusual first-turn options
Response to a first-turn C2 ball

          A first-turn C2 ball is an attempt by blue to make red conform to a
          defensive opening. Red could of course do this if it wants, by playing
          6" north of C4, or even by just having a "standard" east boundary
          ball; however a better option to negate blue's attempt at dictating
          the opening might be to set a duffer tice - this is the ultimate
          aggressive response to the C2 ball, and means that black is suddenly
          faced with having to hit a 10-13 yarder on turn 3 or risk leaving the
          same for yellow next turn, and a laid break.
        
Back to top



 Third
        Ball Options
      

        For the vast majority of players, if they manage to hit in on the third
        turn of the game, they will and should be looking to make a dream leave
        (see top of page) or similar, possibly with red near the peg and blue &
        black with a rush towards it. There are exceptions to this line of play,
        mainly with supershot openings, but unless otherwise stated, the
        standard play would be to try and set a dream leave.
      

Response to WB tice after EB opening

          Realistically, black will not be attempting to make any break on turn
          3 if it manages to hit in. The player of black has to make a judgement
          call on their likelihood of hitting the standard tice vs their
          opponent's likelihood of missing it.
        


            If the tice is long, the best response is probably to shoot black at
            blue from A baulk. Missing black at blue leaves the free shot at the
            tice for yellow of course, which does give yellow fairly good
            prospects if hit. If the tice is extremely long, say peg-high, then
            black could quite feasibly just lag at blue and attempt to leave a
            rush to red. Bear in mind that playing this lag so early in the game
            may be difficult as you may not have the pace of the court - and
            there is a risk that lagging at blue and falling short will leave
            yellow a double target on turn 4.
          

            Another option if black is uncertain, would be to shoot at blue from
            C3, and missing through to C4. This hedges black's bets somewhat, as
            it is still taking a shot at a ball and still somewhat joining with
            partner ball, but does not give good break prospects to the opponent
            if yellow hits, due to the proximity of blue and black to one
            another. Yellow is faced with a long takeoff from red towards blue
            and black and in all likelihood will not get a rush to H1 from this
            position.
          

            The third option is of course to shoot at the tice itself. Hitting
            red will give the opportunity to make a dream leave (as shown at the
            top of the page). Missing red will send black towards C2, which will
            give black a free shot back through red and yellow if yellow misses
            its fourth-turn shot at red.
          





              Some common third-ball responses to a standard tice
            


Response to C2 ball after EB opening

          There are two common options after a second-turn C2 ball - both
          consist of shooting at partner. If partner is hit, then usually the
          play will be to take off to the red in C2, roquet it and then croquet
          it either into the centre of the court, or along the west boundary,
          then lag back to partner and leave a rush in-court. However, consider
          a game where you are the stronger player playing a very capable weaker
          player, if you do hit partner third turn, you can elect to just set a
          rush to the C2 ball instead of trying to retrieve it from C2. As the
          stronger player you may prefer this line of play, instead of digging
          out the C2 ball only for your opponent to hit on turn 4 and have an
          easy break.
        

          Usually the third-turn shot at partner with black will be from A
          baulk, joining up on the east boundary if missed. This leaves a long
          double target for yellow from the end of B baulk. A more defensive
          play would be to shoot at partner from C3 into C4. Doing this leaves
          almost no break prospects fourth-turn for yellow but, depending on the
          distance between blue and black, may give them the opportunity to join
          up.
        

          Another option for black on turn 3 would be to shoot at red in C2 -
          however usually this is only a viable option if red is exactly in the
          corner, as it will mean that missing red on the right leaves no double
          target for yellow. Alternatively, another option would be for black to
          join up with red near C2, about 3-4 feet south of it. Doing so leaves
          no double target from B baulk and gives good break prospects to black
          if yellow misses the 13 yarder, although it must be remembered that
          yellow also has good prospects if it hits the 13 yarder. Black joining
          up with red also leaves a defensive shot for yellow at blue from C3 to
          C4 which, if missed, leaves black a very long and tricky takeoff from
          C2 to the east boundary.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a C2 ball
            


Response to C2 / C4 ball after Supershot opening

          The third-turn response to this option depends greatly on your ability
          and also the ability of your opponent. Before you lay the supershot,
          you need to ask yourself "am I realistically good enough to play a
          third-turn break to 4-back?". If the answer is no, then that does not
          mean that the supershot opening is a bad idea at all, but it just
          means that you may want to reassess your third-turn response.
          Additionally, if you are playing someone that you believe is much
          better than you are, then trying to give yourself a 4-ball break on
          turn 5 is exactly what you should be trying to achieve. Therefore,
          instead of trying to roquet the 13 yard shot of black at red just
          south of C2 (or just north of C4), you can instead look to join up
          with the ball 3-4 feet away, ensuring to leave no double target. This
          puts a great deal of pressure on your stronger opponent to then hit a
          13 yarder or else concede a 4-ball break to you.
        

          If you believe you are good enough to hit on turn 3 and play a break,
          then the answer is simple - hit red near C2 and go round.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / C2 ball
            


Response to EB ball after Supershot opening

          In most cases, the third-turn response to a max distance ball is to
          try and hit it from C3, missing into C4. Again, however, you should
          evaluate your own likelihood of playing a break to 4-back with only 3
          balls on the lawn if you hit, and so you may want to consider lagging
          to the ball, a couple of yards in-lawn from the east boundary.
        

          If the ball on the east boundary is south of the peg, it is tempting
          to simply shoot at it from A baulk. Missing will of course leave a
          double from B baulk, but the odds of yellow then hitting a double
          target from 20+ yards is no certainty. Alternatively, if the
          second-turn ball is around peg-high, then shooting at it from B baulk
          from a few yards west of C3 and missing often results in a fairly even
          spread of the balls, with your black ball being approximately 8 yards
          south of red and 8 yards north of C4. This again is technically a
          double target from somewhere on B Baulk, but given the distance
          between red and black, is easily missed and will leave your black ball
          a shot of only 8 yards.

              ball
            


Response to C4 ball after EB opening

          This opening creates one of the more interesting third-turn decisions.
          A second-turn ball 6" north of C4 is a very threatening position and
          therefore the options will as follows:
        


            Shoot at partner
            
Hit - set a dream leave

                Miss - leaves yellow a 13-yard shot at red in C4 for a 4-ball
                break
              



            Shoot at opponent near C4 from A baulk
            

                Hit - set a dream leave (you may want to have a go at gaining a
                rush to H1 on partner)
              

                Miss - leave a 13-yard double for yellow (but slightly tricky
                break pick-up)
              



            Join up with opponent near C4, leaving no double
            

                If red is 3-6" north of C4 - join a yard north of it from A
                baulk
                
No short double target is left for yellow

                    Yellow still only has a 13-yard shot for the innings (but a
                    slightly tricky break pick-up)
                  



                If red is ~12" north of C4 - shoot from C3 through to C4
                

                    Enables black to have a shot (albeit very long) to attempt
                    to hit and set a dream leave
                  




Black to C2


              By burying itself in C2, this enables black to kill off the
              aggression by red and yellow. Any miss by yellow will leave a 9
              yarder (at most) for blue
            






              Some common third-ball responses to a C4 ball
            



          A personal preference of mine is to shoot third-turn at the ball near
          C4 from A baulk, because hitting gives me control of the court, and I
          miss often enough by more than several inches so as not to leave a
          double.
        

          Be on the lookout for cannons around C4 as part of this opening -
          there is often a good opportunity to bombard a live ball across to H1
          while playing a croquet stroke towards blue on the east boundary. This
          can make picking up the first break a great deal easier.
        
Response to duffer tice after EB opening

          The duffer tice is one of my favourite openings. Because of the
          placement of red near H6, a miss by black from the end of B baulk will
          be headed towards A baulk and give an easy start for yellow. That is
          why we see the ~9 yard shot at red refused so often, even by very
          strong players!
        

          If black does decide to shoot at the duffer and hits, then not a great
          deal of options are available other than to take off to partner ball
          (usually nudging red towards the peg in the process), and leave a rush
          towards red, and then hope for a fourth-turn miss by yellow.
        

          Another option for shooting at the duffer is doing so from C3,
          shooting across the court and missing to around peg-high (or just
          south of peg-high) on the west boundary. This is the most defensive
          shot available in that a miss gives no break to yellow if yellow hits
          red, but it also does not put any pressure on yellow's shot at red.
          Often times, when black misses the shot from C3 at red, it will end up
          south of peg-high on the west boundary and be a tempting free shot for
          yellow from C1.
        

          Shooting at partner ball on turn 3 is the most aggressive line of play
          - taking the shot from A baulk and hitting gives the opportunity to
          play a big croquet stroke loading partner to H2 and attempting to get
          a rush to H1 on the duffer ball - it is a big shot and the break
          chances are normally only reasonable for very strong players. Missing
          partner from A baulk on the other hand gives yellow a ~9 yard shot and
          very strong break prospects. It is therefore more usual to see black
          shoot at blue from C3 which, although longer, doesn't make all the
          balls available to yellow if black misses blue and yellow hits red. It
          also means that blue and black maintain a wide join and have realistic
          prospects of hitting back in if yellow misses red.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a duffer tice
            


Response to 2 balls on EB

          If red has shot at blue on turn 2 and missed, leaving both balls on
          the east boundary, you should carefully evaluate your response based
          on the strength of your opponent. If you and your opponent are evenly
          matched but not world class players, or especially if your opponent is
          a much stronger player than you, then the best thing to do here may be
          to simply ignore the two balls on the east boundary and lag black into
          the middle of the court and wait for yellow to miss. This potentially
          presents you with an immediate break with a ball in the middle of the
          court.
        

          In a match between two very strong players it would be unusual to see
          no shot taken on turn 3, and if hit, some attempt at digging out a
          3-ball break.
        
Response to 2 balls in-court

          In a situation where you have laid a supershot with blue, and red has
          lagged a couple of yards north east of your supershot ball, if there
          is no double target to be had from anywhere on the baulk lines, you
          must again consider your expectations after hitting third turn vs your
          opponent's likelihood of hitting fourth turn. As with previous
          options, if you are playing an opponent who on paper is a much
          stronger player, the percentage play is usually to lag the black ball
          into the middle of the court beside the other two balls (being mindful
          not to leave a double target from anywhere), which will put pressure
          on your stronger opponent to hit in or else concede the first break
          opportunity to you.
        

          If you do want to shoot with black at one of the balls in the middle,
          then consider either shooting at the easterly ball from C1 (you may
          even be able to shoot hard at this without missing to B baulk), or
          alternatively shooting at a medium pace at either blue or red from the
          closest point on A baulk. If you do shoot from the closest point, be
          sure to hit at a pace to finish slightly south of H6, both so that
          black is not a short shot from B baulk, and so that any double target
          that you leave has plenty of space between the front and back ball.
        

          If you are facing a third turn shot with black after red has
          cross-wired blue and red at the peg, check first to see if there is a
          point which you can lag to where blue won't be wired from black, and
          which won't be giving a double target from either baulk line - if
          there is such a spot, then that is the best place to lag to.

Back to top



 Fourth Ball Options
      

The fourth-turn response is usually actually more simple than then third-turn response - although there are more possible scenarios, they almost always result in yellow trying to roquet something.  
      

Response to ignored WB tice
When black has ignored a standard west boundary tice and insetad shot at (and missed) partner on the east boundary, the obvious response is to then try and hit red yourself from C1.  If the placement of red is good, you should have ~50% chance of hitting in.  Your break prospects after hitting red are actually quite good, as you will play a take off from red to blue & black, which will automatically be sending red towards H2 as a pioneer.  On the other hand, a miss with yellow through red into C2 only gives fairly mediocre break prospects to blue & black in the next turn.
Response to missed WB tice
If black did indeed shoot at red (and miss) from C1 in the previous turn, then the obvious response is to shoot at red yourself, but from a point east of C1 so that a miss will leave yellow joined with red.  If you hit red, your best line of play would be to roll red &  yellow towards C1 and lay a rush for your next turn.  A miss from red at yellow will of course leave black a shot through red and yellow from C2 to C1 but is likely to be a very long shot at a single ball target.  A miss from black on turn 5 here also gives you a good chance at establishing a break on turn 5.  




              If black has missed the standard tice, it leaves a good opportunity to join up with red on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C2 ball after EB opening
Having played red into C2 on turn 2, if black ignores red and simply joins with blue (which is likely), then against most players your best line of play would be to shoot at blue and black with red.  Whether you shoot from A baulk or B baulk depends on factors such as the distance between blue and black (whether it is easy to make a double target from B baulk or A baulk) and the flatness of the east boundary.  If the black ball missed blue badly on the left on turn 3, blue and black may well be 2+ yards apart on the east boundary, so there is a defensive option available to yellow as well - shoot from C3 through to C4, where a miss would not give blue & black any easy opening.
If you are the weaker player against a very strong opponent, then there is a case for shooting yellow at red - at 13 yards, it is significantly shorter than any other available shot and is therefore your best chance at winning the opening.  Red missing yellow gives blue a relatively easy start and a probable break, but against a very strong opponent it can still be worth the risk.  




              Fourth-turn responses for yellow when partner is in C2 and opponent balls are on the east boundary.  
            


Response to joined / missed C2 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, if black has for some reason shot at red in C2, then assuming a double target has been left, your best aggressive option is to shoot at this, preferably hitting the northern ball, from B baulk.  A hit or a miss here will give fairly good break prospects to whomever plays the next shot, given C2's proximity to H2 - a semi-good pioneer can usually be sent to H2 while obtaining a rush to H1.
If black has instead joined up a yard south of red on turn 2, you have no double target (except from C1, but let's not consider that).  Now you have fundamentally two options - either shoot yellow at red which will give a good break opportunity if hit (and concede a good break opportunity to black if missed), or take a more defensive line by shooting yellow at blue from C3 into C4.  If yellow misses this shot, it does give black a 1-yard roquet at red for the innings, however it not only gives no break prospects, but also requires black to play several good strokes in order to have a good leave.  Black's take off from C2 to blue on the east boundary is a difficult shot, and if black doesn't succeed in roqueting blue in its next shot (either taking off short and missing blue, or taking off too far and sending black out) then yellow will have a 9-10 yard shot at blue & black from near C4.




              If black has joined a yard south of red near C2, the yellow has aggressive and defensive options available
            


Response to missed EB ball after Supershot opening
The response here depends a lot on both the length of the supershot ball and what option black chose on turn 3.  Firstly let's assume the most common scenario, with blue halfway between H5 and peg, and 1-2 yards west of the centre line, and red approximately peg high on the EB, and black in or near C4.  In this situation the best option is normally to shoot at red from A baulk, with a miss joining up around 1 yard north of it.  This leaves blue a 15-yarder at red & yellow but difficult break prospects for both players, whomever plays the next shot. 




              The common response after a third-turn miss by black at red to C4, is for yellow to shoot at red, joining if missing.  An aggressive line is to shoot at black.  A third option is yellow at blue, which is shorter and will win you the innings, but only gives good break prospects if red and black are near to each other
            


As the weaker player against a stronger player, a very aggressive line of play would be to shoot yellow from A baulk at black in C4 - this is very black and white, as a hit will give you a good chance for a 4-ball break and a miss will give black the same chance.  As the weaker player, you can strongly consider this option.  
Consider for a moment that black's third-turn shot missed red from A baulk, or perhaps missed red from west of C3, finishing 5-10 yards south of red.  In this case, yellow for look for possible double targets available from B baulk.  Consider, too, the shortest shot available, which is yellow at blue from A baulk - this is likely a 11-13 yard shot which, if hit, gives good break prospects to yellow because red and black are close together.
Response to ignored duffer tice
The vast majority of the time the best response to black ignoring red's duffer tice, is for yellow to shoot hard at red from B baulk.  Usually a duffer tice is only 9-10 yards and so it will be, by far, the shortest shot for yellow.




              The majority of the time, the fourth turn response would be to shoot yellow at the duffer.  Against a very strong player, you might be tempted by yellow at black in C4 which, although 3 yards longer, gives an easy start to your break
            


An expection to this would be if blue & black are joined on the east boundary leaving a good double target from A baulk, and so you may want to consider shooting at that instead.  Another option to consider is if black shot and missed blue from C3 to C4.  If you are playing against a much stronger opponent you may consider shooting yellow at black from A baulk into C4.  This shot is 3 yards longer than yellow at red from B baulk, but hitting this shot gives you vastly stronger break prospects than if you hit red first.
Response to missed duffer tice
If black misses the duffer tice (red) gently, the logical response is to shoot hard at either red from B baulk or black from A baulk (whichever is closer).  If black misses the duffer tice from C3 across to the west boundary, you may consider shooting at black from C1 through to C2, particularly if black is south of peg-high.  




              If the duffer tice is still in its original position at the start of turn 4, the general response is for yellow to shoot at red given its proximity to B baulk.  If black missed red from C3 however, it can be tempting to shoot at black from C1 on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C4 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, red a few inches north of C4 and black 1 yard north of blue, yellow's default response should be to shoot at red from A baulk.  Hitting this shot gives a great break opportunity, as it is a very natural stroke to croquet red to H2 while approaching blue & black up the east boundary.  
Response to 3 balls on EB
In this instance, you simply need to hit one of the balls on the east boundary - from either A baulk or B baulk, depending on length and available targets.
Response to 3 balls in-court
A supershot opening with lags by red and black essentially forces yellow to shoot at the closest ball.  A very black and white opening, good break prospects for both players on turn 4 or 5, depending on whether yellow hits or misses.  Often times, black will have take a gentle lag while attempting a roquet at either blue or red on turn 3, so this may also give yellow some target to shoot at on turn 4.

Conclusion
If you have gotten to the bottom of this article, you have probably realised by now that the number of opening options are vast.  This article could not hope to cover every eventuality, and nor does it present any new or unseen openings; rather it serves to talk through the options and thought processes for choosing a particular option, and I hope it has been useful.

Openings

        The opening is the battle between the two sides to be the first to gain
        the upper hand. Generally when we talk about openings in croquet, we are
        referring to the first 4 turns. At the very top level it is where games
        are won and lost, but at all levels it provides a fascinating array of
        options for bluffing and double-bluffing your opponent.
      
Opening priorities
As the stronger player

        The stronger player who is playing a dangerous but less experienced /
        weaker player will generally approach the opening with the intent of not
        giving away an easy break, and hence a more defensive mindset. Openings
        where there is a lot of grey area, balls on boundaries and in corners
        are best for this. The stronger player will generally rely on their
        better all-round game in order to win, and is more comfortable with
        digging balls out slowly into a break.
      
As the weaker player

        The weaker player should approach a game against a much stronger
        opponent with an attacking mindset - they will not be afraid to take on
        relatively short shots that give laid breaks, even if it means conceding
        a laid break if they miss. The weaker player should favour openings that
        have balls in-lawn and should be looking to put pressure on the stronger
        player to have to hit in.
      
Evenly-matched players

        It is quite common to see very aggressive, black and white, openings
        when two very strong players play against each other. The same is true
        for openings between evenly-matched players at lower levels, but
        generally to a lesser extent. A lot of the opening strategy depends on
        the individual mindset of the player, with some players naturally
        playing a more attacking game than others.
      

        Below are articles on various well-known (and some not-so-well-known)
        openings, which discuss options for placement of balls, and responses to
        them. For the purposes of simplicity, in the examples below, the balls
        will always be played in the following order:
      


 Blue
        

 Red
        


          Black
        


          Yellow
        


Note: there is no ball order or sequence in which the balls need to
          be added to the game in croquet - the above order is simply to keep
          things consistent for the diagrams and explanations.


        As you can probably imagine, the options in the opening are endless.
        This article attempts to talk through some of the most common options,
        and some of the most common responses to them, with the idea of
        clarifying some of the thought processes behind them.
      

The Dream Leave

        Many of the openings below will reference something known as the Dream
        Leave - this is a scenario where the third turn ball (black) has hit and
        arranged the court as follows:
      




            Black hit on turn 3 and set a dream leave
          



        Black has retrieved red from wherever it was on the court and placed it
        slightly in-lawn from the west boundary, north of peg-high, and left
        blue a rush to it from the east boundary. This leave gives no short shot
        for yellow, and any miss by yellow will give blue a good break
        opportunity.

 First
        Ball Options
      

East Boundary

          The most common option selected by the first ball player. A ball to
          the east boundary, somewhere between level with H4 and H5, is chosen
          due to its relative distance from both baulk lines and from H1. It is
          a completely non-threatening ball and allows the second ball player to
          dictate the nature of the game, be it defensive or aggressive.
        
In-lawn East Boundary ball

          A variation on the standard east boundary ball, the in-lawn east
          boundary ball is struck out in the same area as the standard east
          boundary ball, but purposefully left about 1 yard in from the yardline
          area. The idea behind that is so that black can play its third turn
          shot out behind blue and leave itself a rush in-court. This play
          discourages responses like a west boundary tice from red.
        
Supershot

          A supershot ball is a first-turn ball placed near the middle of the
          court, normally between H5 and peg and a couple of yards west of the
          centre line. This is the most aggressive sensible option for the first
          ball, and signals your intent to your opponent that you want no grey
          area. Given its proximity to H1, a supershot ball generally gives a
          good chance for a break for either player, depending on whether the
          third-turn, fourth-turn or fifth-turn shots are hit.
        

          There are variations on the length of the supershot, with a supershot
          played to near the peg being a poorer pioneer for H1 but having the
          advantage of lengthening any fourth-turn shot by yellow at it.
        
Anti-duffer

          This opening is an attempt to try and pre-empt the second-turn
          response and discourage a "duffer tice" by red. To lay an anti-duffer,
          you hit blue to a spot somewhere between H6 and the peg, and 1-2 yards
          west of the east boundary. The idea of placing a ball here is that if
          the opponent were to lay a duffer tice with red,
          then it gives black a good chance to hit red and take off behind blue
          for a rush to H1 on turn 3. It is a leave that is generally only used
          by strong players who have a realistic chance of a third-turn break in
          the first place.
        




              Some common first-ball scenarios
            


Unusual first-turn options

          The croquet court is a big place and so there really are endless
          options for where to place balls in the opening. Often an unusual
          option first-turn will yield good results by confusing the opponent!
        
C4 first ball

          Not often seen these days due to a preference for an east boundary
          ball 10 yards further north. A weakness of this opening is that
          shooting at partner on turn 3 and missing is liable to leave a double
          target for yellow. It also generally encourages yellow to take an
          aggressive shot on turn 4; however on a difficult lawn this opening
          can have some advantages, with any hit by yellow on turn 4 at balls in
          C4 leaving little room to promote balls into the court due to the
          close proximity to the corner.
        
C2 first ball

          Playing blue into C2 first turn can often catch the opponent off
          guard. This opening attempts to flip the tables on red and yellow by
          trying to ensure a defensive opening for blue and black. This can be a
          good option where blue and black are the stronger players and want to
          prevent aggressive second-turn options by red and yellow. Of course,
          there are options available to red and yellow which negate blue and
          black's defensive preferences.
        
Micro tice

          As unusual options go, this is right up there. This option would not
          be recommended when playing a strong player, but nevertheless is very
          interesting. The micro tice is a ball played from the end of A baulk
          towards the east boundary, but only 2-3 yards towards it, leaving a
          2-3 yard roquet for the opponent on the second turn. This length of
          shot cannot really be refused, but leaving red a croquet stroke from
          south-west of hoop 4 on the second turn of the game gives no real
          break prospects. Often the second turn player will attempt an approach
          to H1 and fail it, leaving a 6-yard roquet with two balls near H1 for
          black. This opening relies more on a tactical mistake from red than
          anything else
        
C1 / C3 opening

          Occasionally seen. Not a good opening against any experienced
          opponent, but occasionally yields results. This first-turn option is
          not to be recommended. A first-turn ball in C1 followed by a
          second-turn response to C3 (or vice versa) is a killer blow to black's
          turn.
        
Back to top




 Second
        Ball Options
      


          This is where things start to get a little interesting. For the most
          part, the opening is dictated by the second ball response, and there
          are many more options available.
        
Response to East Boundary ball
Standard Tice

          The standard tice is one of the most popular responses to an east
          boundary ball at club-level croquet. Although in recent years it has
          fallen out of favour with top players (likely due to an increase in
          the standard of shooting), it is still a great opening that gives good
          chances to both sides.
        

          The standard tice is where red is played to the west boundary, and the
          distance it is placed north of C1 needs to be carefully considered by
          the striker or red. The name "tice" indicates that the distance should
          be enticing for the player of black to shoot at and so a distance of
          between about 8 and 13 yards is common. As a general rule, if possible
          the distance chosen should either be about 1 yard longer than the
          opponent's critical distance (the distance at which someone hits 50%
          of their shots) or 1 yard shorter (or equal to) your own critical
          distance. Obviously this cannot be achieved if your opponent has a
          longer critical distance than you do, so it is better to err slightly
          on the longer side.
        

          If blue is an in-lawn east boundary ball, laying a standard tice is
          risky, as black can quite easily lay a rush directly to it on the
          third turn.
        
C2 ball

          Probably the most common response to the east boundary ball today is
          the second-turn ball to 6" south of C2. The reason for playing just
          south of C2 is that if in the unlikely event of black shooting at red
          on turn 3, a miss will likely leave yellow a double target. The idea
          of red near C2 means that red is buried in a defensive position, and
          signals yellow's intent to shoot at blue and black on turn 4.
        

          If blue is slightly in-lawn, then C2 is the safest and most defensive
          response with red.
        
Duffer tice

          One of the more aggressive responses for red is the duffer tice. This
          is a ball that is placed usually about 2-feet north and a few inches
          east of penultimate. This is similarly enticing for the opponent to
          shoot (just as with a standard tice) but in this case a miss is
          usually more critical - any third turn shot at the duffer is in the
          direction of A baulk so black usually takes the shot gently - and by
          doing so is more likely to miss. Black missing leaves two balls in the
          centre of the court, giving yellow a great chance on turn 4. The
          duffer tice is a great option for weaker players playing against
          stronger players, and also for anyone confident in hitting 10 yarders.
        

          Between two very strong players a duffer tice is still a popular
          opening. There are variations on the placement of the ball near
          penult, based on the strength of the opponent. It is common to see a
          duffer tice placed level with, or south of, H6, particularly if the
          striker of red and yellow is a very good shot and is confident to hit
          an 11-yarder on turn 4. In a game between experts, the placement of
          red is sometimes moved to the west of H6 to discourage a third-turn
          break after a hit from black at blue.
        
C4 ball

          This option is very popular in New Zealand and although a mirror image
          of the C2 ball, is a lot more aggressive. Placing red 6" north of C4
          not only gives negligible break prospects to black on turn 3 but also
          signals your intent to hit fourth-turn with yellow and have a break. A
          miss at partner by black on turn 3 gives you a 13-yard shot for a
          4-ball break, and a miss by black at red on turn 3 usually gives a
          double target.
        
Shoot at first-turn ball

          A slightly counter-intuitive option but nonetheless an interesting
          one. Shooting red at blue on turn 2 and hitting gives no break
          prospects, but a miss also leaves very slim break prospects for black
          on turn 3 if it hits, unless black is a very strong player. With this
          opening it is quite common to see misses on both turns 2 and 3, and
          often a triple target for yellow at the other 3 balls on turn 4 from B
          baulk.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to east boundary opening
            


Response to Supershot ball

          The supershot ball is the most aggressive opening that the first-turn
          player can use. There are several responses to this which need to be
          considered, based on your assessment of your opponent's ability and
          whether the opponent has realistic prospects of a break to 4-back if
          they do manage to hit 3rd turn.
        
C2 response

          The C2 response is a ball played about 6" south of C2. This is a
          strong response to a supershot against almost all players. If the
          player of black wants to attempt a third-turn break, they will have to
          hit a 13-yarder and play a very difficult croquet stroke out of C2 to
          get a rush to H1, and this is by no means guaranteed. On the other
          hand, a miss by black at red on turn 3 will leave yellow a double
          target and a 4-ball break if hit.
        




              It is important to finish a few inches south of C2 with red as it
              will mean black missing on either side of it will leave a double
              target. Above is a comparison of yellow's target after a
              third-turn miss by black at red, firstly with red in C2 and
              secondly with red a few inches south of C2
            



          There are only a handful of players in the world where the C2 ball is
          not a great response - players who would expect to hit the 13 yarder
          most of the time and also be good enough at croquet strokes to expect
          to get a rush to H1 on the supershot ball. Against these players the
          strategy of lengthing the 3rd turn shot would be preferred.
        
C4 response

          Mirror image to the C2 response, this ball is played 6" north of C4.
          Consider this if blue (the supershot ball) is placed further north
          than normal (somewhere near peg-high), or is in a particular spot
          which may have H4 obscuring any croquet stroke from C4 towards it. It
          otherwise gives all the same advantages as the C2 response
        
Max Distance response

          As a counter to the very top players hitting the ball in C2 most of
          the time, the max distance response became popular - this is where red
          is played to the east boundary about level with the peg on the east
          boundary, leaving the longest shot possible for black. This response
          grants black a shot from C3 through red and into C4, reducing yellow's
          fourth-turn prospects - it relies more on black missing red than
          trying to make any break pick-up by black more difficult. Generally a
          good option against the very best players, but against most players is
          unnecessary.  
The reason why max distance on the east boundary is chosen instead of the equivalent max distance spot on the west boundary is that it is slightly further from the supershot ball (blue), which is slightly south-west of the peg.  Assuming that the shots on turns 3 and 4 are missed, blue's shot at red & yellow on the east boundary will be a couple of yards longer than the equivalent shot to the west boundary.  
Supershot lag

          The response for red to lag to a spot 3-4 yards east and 1-2 yards
          north of the supershot ball is a very strong and very under-used
          response to the supershot. This is a good tactic when playing someone
          who is a very good shot, and in particular if the supershot ball
          itself is quite deep (nearer the peg than H5). Placing red beside blue
          nullifies the strength of black's shooting by encouraging black to
          take its third turn shot gently (which is generally less accurate), or
          risk shooting hard and missing into B baulk, conceding a 4-ball break.
          In this case, black may choose not to shoot at all, and instead also
          lag to a position wide of the other two balls, meaning that red and
          yellow have successfully turned the tables of the supershot opening
          and enabled yellow to have the first attempted roquet.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to supershot opening
            


Roquet the Supershot ball

          The ultimate way to nullify the supershot ball - roquet it on the
          second turn. After roqueting blue with red, there are several options
          available. You can croquet blue towards C2 and then fire red off 6"
          north of C4. A more aggressive option would be to croquet blue
          north-west of H2 and fire red off the south boundary, south of H4 -
          this leaves black a choice of 7-8 yarders but minimal break prospects
          and difficult strokes with their third turn in order to distance the
          balls from baulk. A more novel option would be to crosswire blue and
          red at the peg, which leaves only a 17-yard shot for black with a
          baulk line in the background. An even more interesting option might be
          to roll blue close to the peg, either east or west, and then play red
          a yard or two away from it, wiring blue's backswing at red. This means
          that black probably has no lag option towards blue that doesn't leave
          a double-target for yellow.
        
Response to unusual first-turn options
Response to a first-turn C2 ball

          A first-turn C2 ball is an attempt by blue to make red conform to a
          defensive opening. Red could of course do this if it wants, by playing
          6" north of C4, or even by just having a "standard" east boundary
          ball; however a better option to negate blue's attempt at dictating
          the opening might be to set a duffer tice - this is the ultimate
          aggressive response to the C2 ball, and means that black is suddenly
          faced with having to hit a 10-13 yarder on turn 3 or risk leaving the
          same for yellow next turn, and a laid break.

 Third
        Ball Options
      

        For the vast majority of players, if they manage to hit in on the third
        turn of the game, they will and should be looking to make a dream leave
        (see top of page) or similar, possibly with red near the peg and blue &
        black with a rush towards it. There are exceptions to this line of play,
        mainly with supershot openings, but unless otherwise stated, the
        standard play would be to try and set a dream leave.
      

Response to WB tice after EB opening

          Realistically, black will not be attempting to make any break on turn
          3 if it manages to hit in. The player of black has to make a judgement
          call on their likelihood of hitting the standard tice vs their
          opponent's likelihood of missing it.
        


            If the tice is long, the best response is probably to shoot black at
            blue from A baulk. Missing black at blue leaves the free shot at the
            tice for yellow of course, which does give yellow fairly good
            prospects if hit. If the tice is extremely long, say peg-high, then
            black could quite feasibly just lag at blue and attempt to leave a
            rush to red. Bear in mind that playing this lag so early in the game
            may be difficult as you may not have the pace of the court - and
            there is a risk that lagging at blue and falling short will leave
            yellow a double target on turn 4.
          

            Another option if black is uncertain, would be to shoot at blue from
            C3, and missing through to C4. This hedges black's bets somewhat, as
            it is still taking a shot at a ball and still somewhat joining with
            partner ball, but does not give good break prospects to the opponent
            if yellow hits, due to the proximity of blue and black to one
            another. Yellow is faced with a long takeoff from red towards blue
            and black and in all likelihood will not get a rush to H1 from this
            position.
          

            The third option is of course to shoot at the tice itself. Hitting
            red will give the opportunity to make a dream leave (as shown at the
            top of the page). Missing red will send black towards C2, which will
            give black a free shot back through red and yellow if yellow misses
            its fourth-turn shot at red.
          





              Some common third-ball responses to a standard tice
            


Response to C2 ball after EB opening

          There are two common options after a second-turn C2 ball - both
          consist of shooting at partner. If partner is hit, then usually the
          play will be to take off to the red in C2, roquet it and then croquet
          it either into the centre of the court, or along the west boundary,
          then lag back to partner and leave a rush in-court. However, consider
          a game where you are the stronger player playing a very capable weaker
          player, if you do hit partner third turn, you can elect to just set a
          rush to the C2 ball instead of trying to retrieve it from C2. As the
          stronger player you may prefer this line of play, instead of digging
          out the C2 ball only for your opponent to hit on turn 4 and have an
          easy break.
        

          Usually the third-turn shot at partner with black will be from A
          baulk, joining up on the east boundary if missed. This leaves a long
          double target for yellow from the end of B baulk. A more defensive
          play would be to shoot at partner from C3 into C4. Doing this leaves
          almost no break prospects fourth-turn for yellow but, depending on the
          distance between blue and black, may give them the opportunity to join
          up.
        

          Another option for black on turn 3 would be to shoot at red in C2 -
          however usually this is only a viable option if red is exactly in the
          corner, as it will mean that missing red on the right leaves no double
          target for yellow. Alternatively, another option would be for black to
          join up with red near C2, about 3-4 feet south of it. Doing so leaves
          no double target from B baulk and gives good break prospects to black
          if yellow misses the 13 yarder, although it must be remembered that
          yellow also has good prospects if it hits the 13 yarder. Black joining
          up with red also leaves a defensive shot for yellow at blue from C3 to
          C4 which, if missed, leaves black a very long and tricky takeoff from
          C2 to the east boundary.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a C2 ball
            


Response to C2 / C4 ball after Supershot opening

          The third-turn response to this option depends greatly on your ability
          and also the ability of your opponent. Before you lay the supershot,
          you need to ask yourself "am I realistically good enough to play a
          third-turn break to 4-back?". If the answer is no, then that does not
          mean that the supershot opening is a bad idea at all, but it just
          means that you may want to reassess your third-turn response.
          Additionally, if you are playing someone that you believe is much
          better than you are, then trying to give yourself a 4-ball break on
          turn 5 is exactly what you should be trying to achieve. Therefore,
          instead of trying to roquet the 13 yard shot of black at red just
          south of C2 (or just north of C4), you can instead look to join up
          with the ball 3-4 feet away, ensuring to leave no double target. This
          puts a great deal of pressure on your stronger opponent to then hit a
          13 yarder or else concede a 4-ball break to you.
        

          If you believe you are good enough to hit on turn 3 and play a break,
          then the answer is simple - hit red near C2 and go round.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / C2 ball
            


Response to EB ball after Supershot opening

          In most cases, the third-turn response to a max distance ball is to
          try and hit it from C3, missing into C4. Again, however, you should
          evaluate your own likelihood of playing a break to 4-back with only 3
          balls on the lawn if you hit, and so you may want to consider lagging
          to the ball, a couple of yards in-lawn from the east boundary.
        

          If the ball on the east boundary is south of the peg, it is tempting
          to simply shoot at it from A baulk. Missing will of course leave a
          double from B baulk, but the odds of yellow then hitting a double
          target from 20+ yards is no certainty. Alternatively, if the
          second-turn ball is around peg-high, then shooting at it from B baulk
          from a few yards west of C3 and missing often results in a fairly even
          spread of the balls, with your black ball being approximately 8 yards
          south of red and 8 yards north of C4. This again is technically a
          double target from somewhere on B Baulk, but given the distance
          between red and black, is easily missed and will leave your black ball
          a shot of only 8 yards.

              ball
            


Response to C4 ball after EB opening

          This opening creates one of the more interesting third-turn decisions.
          A second-turn ball 6" north of C4 is a very threatening position and
          therefore the options will as follows:
        


            Shoot at partner
            
Hit - set a dream leave

                Miss - leaves yellow a 13-yard shot at red in C4 for a 4-ball
                break
              



            Shoot at opponent near C4 from A baulk
            

                Hit - set a dream leave (you may want to have a go at gaining a
                rush to H1 on partner)
              

                Miss - leave a 13-yard double for yellow (but slightly tricky
                break pick-up)
              



            Join up with opponent near C4, leaving no double
            

                If red is 3-6" north of C4 - join a yard north of it from A
                baulk
                
No short double target is left for yellow

                    Yellow still only has a 13-yard shot for the innings (but a
                    slightly tricky break pick-up)
                  



                If red is ~12" north of C4 - shoot from C3 through to C4
                

                    Enables black to have a shot (albeit very long) to attempt
                    to hit and set a dream leave
                  




Black to C2


              By burying itself in C2, this enables black to kill off the
              aggression by red and yellow. Any miss by yellow will leave a 9
              yarder (at most) for blue
            






              Some common third-ball responses to a C4 ball
            



          A personal preference of mine is to shoot third-turn at the ball near
          C4 from A baulk, because hitting gives me control of the court, and I
          miss often enough by more than several inches so as not to leave a
          double.
        

          Be on the lookout for cannons around C4 as part of this opening -
          there is often a good opportunity to bombard a live ball across to H1
          while playing a croquet stroke towards blue on the east boundary. This
          can make picking up the first break a great deal easier.
        
Response to duffer tice after EB opening

          The duffer tice is one of my favourite openings. Because of the
          placement of red near H6, a miss by black from the end of B baulk will
          be headed towards A baulk and give an easy start for yellow. That is
          why we see the ~9 yard shot at red refused so often, even by very
          strong players!
        

          If black does decide to shoot at the duffer and hits, then not a great
          deal of options are available other than to take off to partner ball
          (usually nudging red towards the peg in the process), and leave a rush
          towards red, and then hope for a fourth-turn miss by yellow.
        

          Another option for shooting at the duffer is doing so from C3,
          shooting across the court and missing to around peg-high (or just
          south of peg-high) on the west boundary. This is the most defensive
          shot available in that a miss gives no break to yellow if yellow hits
          red, but it also does not put any pressure on yellow's shot at red.
          Often times, when black misses the shot from C3 at red, it will end up
          south of peg-high on the west boundary and be a tempting free shot for
          yellow from C1.
        

          Shooting at partner ball on turn 3 is the most aggressive line of play
          - taking the shot from A baulk and hitting gives the opportunity to
          play a big croquet stroke loading partner to H2 and attempting to get
          a rush to H1 on the duffer ball - it is a big shot and the break
          chances are normally only reasonable for very strong players. Missing
          partner from A baulk on the other hand gives yellow a ~9 yard shot and
          very strong break prospects. It is therefore more usual to see black
          shoot at blue from C3 which, although longer, doesn't make all the
          balls available to yellow if black misses blue and yellow hits red. It
          also means that blue and black maintain a wide join and have realistic
          prospects of hitting back in if yellow misses red.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a duffer tice
            


Response to 2 balls on EB

          If red has shot at blue on turn 2 and missed, leaving both balls on
          the east boundary, you should carefully evaluate your response based
          on the strength of your opponent. If you and your opponent are evenly
          matched but not world class players, or especially if your opponent is
          a much stronger player than you, then the best thing to do here may be
          to simply ignore the two balls on the east boundary and lag black into
          the middle of the court and wait for yellow to miss. This potentially
          presents you with an immediate break with a ball in the middle of the
          court.
        

          In a match between two very strong players it would be unusual to see
          no shot taken on turn 3, and if hit, some attempt at digging out a
          3-ball break.
        
Response to 2 balls in-court

          In a situation where you have laid a supershot with blue, and red has
          lagged a couple of yards north east of your supershot ball, if there
          is no double target to be had from anywhere on the baulk lines, you
          must again consider your expectations after hitting third turn vs your
          opponent's likelihood of hitting fourth turn. As with previous
          options, if you are playing an opponent who on paper is a much
          stronger player, the percentage play is usually to lag the black ball
          into the middle of the court beside the other two balls (being mindful
          not to leave a double target from anywhere), which will put pressure
          on your stronger opponent to hit in or else concede the first break
          opportunity to you.
        

          If you do want to shoot with black at one of the balls in the middle,
          then consider either shooting at the easterly ball from C1 (you may
          even be able to shoot hard at this without missing to B baulk), or
          alternatively shooting at a medium pace at either blue or red from the
          closest point on A baulk. If you do shoot from the closest point, be
          sure to hit at a pace to finish slightly south of H6, both so that
          black is not a short shot from B baulk, and so that any double target
          that you leave has plenty of space between the front and back ball.
        

          If you are facing a third turn shot with black after red has
          cross-wired blue and red at the peg, check first to see if there is a
          point which you can lag to where blue won't be wired from black, and
          which won't be giving a double target from either baulk line - if
          there is such a spot, then that is the best place to lag to.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to supershot lag
            


Back to top



 Fourth Ball Options
      

The fourth-turn response is usually actually more simple than then third-turn response - although there are more possible scenarios, they almost always result in yellow trying to roquet something.  
      

Response to ignored WB tice
When black has ignored a standard west boundary tice and insetad shot at (and missed) partner on the east boundary, the obvious response is to then try and hit red yourself from C1.  If the placement of red is good, you should have ~50% chance of hitting in.  Your break prospects after hitting red are actually quite good, as you will play a take off from red to blue & black, which will automatically be sending red towards H2 as a pioneer.  On the other hand, a miss with yellow through red into C2 only gives fairly mediocre break prospects to blue & black in the next turn.
Response to missed WB tice
If black did indeed shoot at red (and miss) from C1 in the previous turn, then the obvious response is to shoot at red yourself, but from a point east of C1 so that a miss will leave yellow joined with red.  If you hit red, your best line of play would be to roll red &  yellow towards C1 and lay a rush for your next turn.  A miss from red at yellow will of course leave black a shot through red and yellow from C2 to C1 but is likely to be a very long shot at a single ball target.  A miss from black on turn 5 here also gives you a good chance at establishing a break on turn 5.  




              If black has missed the standard tice, it leaves a good opportunity to join up with red on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C2 ball after EB opening
Having played red into C2 on turn 2, if black ignores red and simply joins with blue (which is likely), then against most players your best line of play would be to shoot at blue and black with red.  Whether you shoot from A baulk or B baulk depends on factors such as the distance between blue and black (whether it is easy to make a double target from B baulk or A baulk) and the flatness of the east boundary.  If the black ball missed blue badly on the left on turn 3, blue and black may well be 2+ yards apart on the east boundary, so there is a defensive option available to yellow as well - shoot from C3 through to C4, where a miss would not give blue & black any easy opening.
If you are the weaker player against a very strong opponent, then there is a case for shooting yellow at red - at 13 yards, it is significantly shorter than any other available shot and is therefore your best chance at winning the opening.  Red missing yellow gives blue a relatively easy start and a probable break, but against a very strong opponent it can still be worth the risk.  




              Fourth-turn responses for yellow when partner is in C2 and opponent balls are on the east boundary.  
            


Response to joined / missed C2 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, if black has for some reason shot at red in C2, then assuming a double target has been left, your best aggressive option is to shoot at this, preferably hitting the northern ball, from B baulk.  A hit or a miss here will give fairly good break prospects to whomever plays the next shot, given C2's proximity to H2 - a semi-good pioneer can usually be sent to H2 while obtaining a rush to H1.
If black has instead joined up a yard south of red on turn 2, you have no double target (except from C1, but let's not consider that).  Now you have fundamentally two options - either shoot yellow at red which will give a good break opportunity if hit (and concede a good break opportunity to black if missed), or take a more defensive line by shooting yellow at blue from C3 into C4.  If yellow misses this shot, it does give black a 1-yard roquet at red for the innings, however it not only gives no break prospects, but also requires black to play several good strokes in order to have a good leave.  Black's take off from C2 to blue on the east boundary is a difficult shot, and if black doesn't succeed in roqueting blue in its next shot (either taking off short and missing blue, or taking off too far and sending black out) then yellow will have a 9-10 yard shot at blue & black from near C4.




              If black has joined a yard south of red near C2, the yellow has aggressive and defensive options available
            


Response to missed EB ball after Supershot opening
The response here depends a lot on both the length of the supershot ball and what option black chose on turn 3.  Firstly let's assume the most common scenario, with blue halfway between H5 and peg, and 1-2 yards west of the centre line, and red approximately peg high on the EB, and black in or near C4.  In this situation the best option is normally to shoot at red from A baulk, with a miss joining up around 1 yard north of it.  This leaves blue a 15-yarder at red & yellow but difficult break prospects for both players, whomever plays the next shot. 




              The common response after a third-turn miss by black at red to C4, is for yellow to shoot at red, joining if missing.  An aggressive line is to shoot at black.  A third option is yellow at blue, which is shorter and will win you the innings, but only gives good break prospects if red and black are near to each other
            


As the weaker player against a stronger player, a very aggressive line of play would be to shoot yellow from A baulk at black in C4 - this is very black and white, as a hit will give you a good chance for a 4-ball break and a miss will give black the same chance.  As the weaker player, you can strongly consider this option.  
Consider for a moment that black's third-turn shot missed red from A baulk, or perhaps missed red from west of C3, finishing 5-10 yards south of red.  In this case, yellow for look for possible double targets available from B baulk.  Consider, too, the shortest shot available, which is yellow at blue from A baulk - this is likely a 11-13 yard shot which, if hit, gives good break prospects to yellow because red and black are close together.
Response to ignored duffer tice
The vast majority of the time the best response to black ignoring red's duffer tice, is for yellow to shoot hard at red from B baulk.  Usually a duffer tice is only 9-10 yards and so it will be, by far, the shortest shot for yellow.




              The majority of the time, the fourth turn response would be to shoot yellow at the duffer.  Against a very strong player, you might be tempted by yellow at black in C4 which, although 3 yards longer, gives an easy start to your break
            


An expection to this would be if blue & black are joined on the east boundary leaving a good double target from A baulk, and so you may want to consider shooting at that instead.  Another option to consider is if black shot and missed blue from C3 to C4.  If you are playing against a much stronger opponent you may consider shooting yellow at black from A baulk into C4.  This shot is 3 yards longer than yellow at red from B baulk, but hitting this shot gives you vastly stronger break prospects than if you hit red first.
Response to missed duffer tice
If black misses the duffer tice (red) gently, the logical response is to shoot hard at either red from B baulk or black from A baulk (whichever is closer).  If black misses the duffer tice from C3 across to the west boundary, you may consider shooting at black from C1 through to C2, particularly if black is south of peg-high.  




              If the duffer tice is still in its original position at the start of turn 4, the general response is for yellow to shoot at red given its proximity to B baulk.  If black missed red from C3 however, it can be tempting to shoot at black from C1 on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C4 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, red a few inches north of C4 and black 1 yard north of blue, yellow's default response should be to shoot at red from A baulk.  Hitting this shot gives a great break opportunity, as it is a very natural stroke to croquet red to H2 while approaching blue & black up the east boundary.  
Response to 3 balls on EB
In this instance, you simply need to hit one of the balls on the east boundary - from either A baulk or B baulk, depending on length and available targets.
Response to 3 balls in-court
A supershot opening with lags by red and black essentially forces yellow to shoot at the closest ball.  A very black and white opening, good break prospects for both players on turn 4 or 5, depending on whether yellow hits or misses.  Often times, black will have take a gentle lag while attempting a roquet at either blue or red on turn 3, so this may also give yellow some target to shoot at on turn 4.

Conclusion
If you have gotten to the bottom of this article, you have probably realised by now that the number of opening options are vast.  This article could not hope to cover every eventuality, and nor does it present any new or unseen openings; rather it serves to talk through the options and thought processes for choosing a particular option, and I hope it has been useful.

Openings

        The opening is the battle between the two sides to be the first to gain
        the upper hand. Generally when we talk about openings in croquet, we are
        referring to the first 4 turns. At the very top level it is where games
        are won and lost, but at all levels it provides a fascinating array of
        options for bluffing and double-bluffing your opponent.
      
Opening priorities
As the stronger player

        The stronger player who is playing a dangerous but less experienced /
        weaker player will generally approach the opening with the intent of not
        giving away an easy break, and hence a more defensive mindset. Openings
        where there is a lot of grey area, balls on boundaries and in corners
        are best for this. The stronger player will generally rely on their
        better all-round game in order to win, and is more comfortable with
        digging balls out slowly into a break.
      
As the weaker player

        The weaker player should approach a game against a much stronger
        opponent with an attacking mindset - they will not be afraid to take on
        relatively short shots that give laid breaks, even if it means conceding
        a laid break if they miss. The weaker player should favour openings that
        have balls in-lawn and should be looking to put pressure on the stronger
        player to have to hit in.
      
Evenly-matched players

        It is quite common to see very aggressive, black and white, openings
        when two very strong players play against each other. The same is true
        for openings between evenly-matched players at lower levels, but
        generally to a lesser extent. A lot of the opening strategy depends on
        the individual mindset of the player, with some players naturally
        playing a more attacking game than others.
      

        Below are articles on various well-known (and some not-so-well-known)
        openings, which discuss options for placement of balls, and responses to
        them. For the purposes of simplicity, in the examples below, the balls
        will always be played in the following order:
      


 Blue
        

 Red
        


          Black
        


          Yellow
        


Note: there is no ball order or sequence in which the balls need to
          be added to the game in croquet - the above order is simply to keep
          things consistent for the diagrams and explanations.


        As you can probably imagine, the options in the opening are endless.
        This article attempts to talk through some of the most common options,
        and some of the most common responses to them, with the idea of
        clarifying some of the thought processes behind them.
      

The Dream Leave

        Many of the openings below will reference something known as the Dream
        Leave - this is a scenario where the third turn ball (black) has hit and
        arranged the court as follows:
      




            Black hit on turn 3 and set a dream leave
          



        Black has retrieved red from wherever it was on the court and placed it
        slightly in-lawn from the west boundary, north of peg-high, and left
        blue a rush to it from the east boundary. This leave gives no short shot
        for yellow, and any miss by yellow will give blue a good break
        opportunity.

 First
        Ball Options
      

East Boundary

          The most common option selected by the first ball player. A ball to
          the east boundary, somewhere between level with H4 and H5, is chosen
          due to its relative distance from both baulk lines and from H1. It is
          a completely non-threatening ball and allows the second ball player to
          dictate the nature of the game, be it defensive or aggressive.
        
In-lawn East Boundary ball

          A variation on the standard east boundary ball, the in-lawn east
          boundary ball is struck out in the same area as the standard east
          boundary ball, but purposefully left about 1 yard in from the yardline
          area. The idea behind that is so that black can play its third turn
          shot out behind blue and leave itself a rush in-court. This play
          discourages responses like a west boundary tice from red.
        
Supershot

          A supershot ball is a first-turn ball placed near the middle of the
          court, normally between H5 and peg and a couple of yards west of the
          centre line. This is the most aggressive sensible option for the first
          ball, and signals your intent to your opponent that you want no grey
          area. Given its proximity to H1, a supershot ball generally gives a
          good chance for a break for either player, depending on whether the
          third-turn, fourth-turn or fifth-turn shots are hit.
        

          There are variations on the length of the supershot, with a supershot
          played to near the peg being a poorer pioneer for H1 but having the
          advantage of lengthening any fourth-turn shot by yellow at it.
        
Anti-duffer

          This opening is an attempt to try and pre-empt the second-turn
          response and discourage a "duffer tice" by red. To lay an anti-duffer,
          you hit blue to a spot somewhere between H6 and the peg, and 1-2 yards
          west of the east boundary. The idea of placing a ball here is that if
          the opponent were to lay a duffer tice with red,
          then it gives black a good chance to hit red and take off behind blue
          for a rush to H1 on turn 3. It is a leave that is generally only used
          by strong players who have a realistic chance of a third-turn break in
          the first place.
        




              Some common first-ball scenarios
            


Unusual first-turn options

          The croquet court is a big place and so there really are endless
          options for where to place balls in the opening. Often an unusual
          option first-turn will yield good results by confusing the opponent!
        
C4 first ball

          Not often seen these days due to a preference for an east boundary
          ball 10 yards further north. A weakness of this opening is that
          shooting at partner on turn 3 and missing is liable to leave a double
          target for yellow. It also generally encourages yellow to take an
          aggressive shot on turn 4; however on a difficult lawn this opening
          can have some advantages, with any hit by yellow on turn 4 at balls in
          C4 leaving little room to promote balls into the court due to the
          close proximity to the corner.
        
C2 first ball

          Playing blue into C2 first turn can often catch the opponent off
          guard. This opening attempts to flip the tables on red and yellow by
          trying to ensure a defensive opening for blue and black. This can be a
          good option where blue and black are the stronger players and want to
          prevent aggressive second-turn options by red and yellow. Of course,
          there are options available to red and yellow which negate blue and
          black's defensive preferences.
        
Micro tice

          As unusual options go, this is right up there. This option would not
          be recommended when playing a strong player, but nevertheless is very
          interesting. The micro tice is a ball played from the end of A baulk
          towards the east boundary, but only 2-3 yards towards it, leaving a
          2-3 yard roquet for the opponent on the second turn. This length of
          shot cannot really be refused, but leaving red a croquet stroke from
          south-west of hoop 4 on the second turn of the game gives no real
          break prospects. Often the second turn player will attempt an approach
          to H1 and fail it, leaving a 6-yard roquet with two balls near H1 for
          black. This opening relies more on a tactical mistake from red than
          anything else
        
C1 / C3 opening

          Occasionally seen. Not a good opening against any experienced
          opponent, but occasionally yields results. This first-turn option is
          not to be recommended. A first-turn ball in C1 followed by a
          second-turn response to C3 (or vice versa) is a killer blow to black's
          turn.

 Second
        Ball Options
      


          This is where things start to get a little interesting. For the most
          part, the opening is dictated by the second ball response, and there
          are many more options available.
        
Response to East Boundary ball
Standard Tice

          The standard tice is one of the most popular responses to an east
          boundary ball at club-level croquet. Although in recent years it has
          fallen out of favour with top players (likely due to an increase in
          the standard of shooting), it is still a great opening that gives good
          chances to both sides.
        

          The standard tice is where red is played to the west boundary, and the
          distance it is placed north of C1 needs to be carefully considered by
          the striker or red. The name "tice" indicates that the distance should
          be enticing for the player of black to shoot at and so a distance of
          between about 8 and 13 yards is common. As a general rule, if possible
          the distance chosen should either be about 1 yard longer than the
          opponent's critical distance (the distance at which someone hits 50%
          of their shots) or 1 yard shorter (or equal to) your own critical
          distance. Obviously this cannot be achieved if your opponent has a
          longer critical distance than you do, so it is better to err slightly
          on the longer side.
        

          If blue is an in-lawn east boundary ball, laying a standard tice is
          risky, as black can quite easily lay a rush directly to it on the
          third turn.
        
C2 ball

          Probably the most common response to the east boundary ball today is
          the second-turn ball to 6" south of C2. The reason for playing just
          south of C2 is that if in the unlikely event of black shooting at red
          on turn 3, a miss will likely leave yellow a double target. The idea
          of red near C2 means that red is buried in a defensive position, and
          signals yellow's intent to shoot at blue and black on turn 4.
        

          If blue is slightly in-lawn, then C2 is the safest and most defensive
          response with red.
        
Duffer tice

          One of the more aggressive responses for red is the duffer tice. This
          is a ball that is placed usually about 2-feet north and a few inches
          east of penultimate. This is similarly enticing for the opponent to
          shoot (just as with a standard tice) but in this case a miss is
          usually more critical - any third turn shot at the duffer is in the
          direction of A baulk so black usually takes the shot gently - and by
          doing so is more likely to miss. Black missing leaves two balls in the
          centre of the court, giving yellow a great chance on turn 4. The
          duffer tice is a great option for weaker players playing against
          stronger players, and also for anyone confident in hitting 10 yarders.
        

          Between two very strong players a duffer tice is still a popular
          opening. There are variations on the placement of the ball near
          penult, based on the strength of the opponent. It is common to see a
          duffer tice placed level with, or south of, H6, particularly if the
          striker of red and yellow is a very good shot and is confident to hit
          an 11-yarder on turn 4. In a game between experts, the placement of
          red is sometimes moved to the west of H6 to discourage a third-turn
          break after a hit from black at blue.
        
C4 ball

          This option is very popular in New Zealand and although a mirror image
          of the C2 ball, is a lot more aggressive. Placing red 6" north of C4
          not only gives negligible break prospects to black on turn 3 but also
          signals your intent to hit fourth-turn with yellow and have a break. A
          miss at partner by black on turn 3 gives you a 13-yard shot for a
          4-ball break, and a miss by black at red on turn 3 usually gives a
          double target.
        
Shoot at first-turn ball

          A slightly counter-intuitive option but nonetheless an interesting
          one. Shooting red at blue on turn 2 and hitting gives no break
          prospects, but a miss also leaves very slim break prospects for black
          on turn 3 if it hits, unless black is a very strong player. With this
          opening it is quite common to see misses on both turns 2 and 3, and
          often a triple target for yellow at the other 3 balls on turn 4 from B
          baulk.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to east boundary opening
            


Response to Supershot ball

          The supershot ball is the most aggressive opening that the first-turn
          player can use. There are several responses to this which need to be
          considered, based on your assessment of your opponent's ability and
          whether the opponent has realistic prospects of a break to 4-back if
          they do manage to hit 3rd turn.
        
C2 response

          The C2 response is a ball played about 6" south of C2. This is a
          strong response to a supershot against almost all players. If the
          player of black wants to attempt a third-turn break, they will have to
          hit a 13-yarder and play a very difficult croquet stroke out of C2 to
          get a rush to H1, and this is by no means guaranteed. On the other
          hand, a miss by black at red on turn 3 will leave yellow a double
          target and a 4-ball break if hit.
        




              It is important to finish a few inches south of C2 with red as it
              will mean black missing on either side of it will leave a double
              target. Above is a comparison of yellow's target after a
              third-turn miss by black at red, firstly with red in C2 and
              secondly with red a few inches south of C2
            



          There are only a handful of players in the world where the C2 ball is
          not a great response - players who would expect to hit the 13 yarder
          most of the time and also be good enough at croquet strokes to expect
          to get a rush to H1 on the supershot ball. Against these players the
          strategy of lengthing the 3rd turn shot would be preferred.
        
C4 response

          Mirror image to the C2 response, this ball is played 6" north of C4.
          Consider this if blue (the supershot ball) is placed further north
          than normal (somewhere near peg-high), or is in a particular spot
          which may have H4 obscuring any croquet stroke from C4 towards it. It
          otherwise gives all the same advantages as the C2 response
        
Max Distance response

          As a counter to the very top players hitting the ball in C2 most of
          the time, the max distance response became popular - this is where red
          is played to the east boundary about level with the peg on the east
          boundary, leaving the longest shot possible for black. This response
          grants black a shot from C3 through red and into C4, reducing yellow's
          fourth-turn prospects - it relies more on black missing red than
          trying to make any break pick-up by black more difficult. Generally a
          good option against the very best players, but against most players is
          unnecessary.  
The reason why max distance on the east boundary is chosen instead of the equivalent max distance spot on the west boundary is that it is slightly further from the supershot ball (blue), which is slightly south-west of the peg.  Assuming that the shots on turns 3 and 4 are missed, blue's shot at red & yellow on the east boundary will be a couple of yards longer than the equivalent shot to the west boundary.  
Supershot lag

          The response for red to lag to a spot 3-4 yards east and 1-2 yards
          north of the supershot ball is a very strong and very under-used
          response to the supershot. This is a good tactic when playing someone
          who is a very good shot, and in particular if the supershot ball
          itself is quite deep (nearer the peg than H5). Placing red beside blue
          nullifies the strength of black's shooting by encouraging black to
          take its third turn shot gently (which is generally less accurate), or
          risk shooting hard and missing into B baulk, conceding a 4-ball break.
          In this case, black may choose not to shoot at all, and instead also
          lag to a position wide of the other two balls, meaning that red and
          yellow have successfully turned the tables of the supershot opening
          and enabled yellow to have the first attempted roquet.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to supershot opening
            


Roquet the Supershot ball

          The ultimate way to nullify the supershot ball - roquet it on the
          second turn. After roqueting blue with red, there are several options
          available. You can croquet blue towards C2 and then fire red off 6"
          north of C4. A more aggressive option would be to croquet blue
          north-west of H2 and fire red off the south boundary, south of H4 -
          this leaves black a choice of 7-8 yarders but minimal break prospects
          and difficult strokes with their third turn in order to distance the
          balls from baulk. A more novel option would be to crosswire blue and
          red at the peg, which leaves only a 17-yard shot for black with a
          baulk line in the background. An even more interesting option might be
          to roll blue close to the peg, either east or west, and then play red
          a yard or two away from it, wiring blue's backswing at red. This means
          that black probably has no lag option towards blue that doesn't leave
          a double-target for yellow.
        
Response to unusual first-turn options
Response to a first-turn C2 ball

          A first-turn C2 ball is an attempt by blue to make red conform to a
          defensive opening. Red could of course do this if it wants, by playing
          6" north of C4, or even by just having a "standard" east boundary
          ball; however a better option to negate blue's attempt at dictating
          the opening might be to set a duffer tice - this is the ultimate
          aggressive response to the C2 ball, and means that black is suddenly
          faced with having to hit a 10-13 yarder on turn 3 or risk leaving the
          same for yellow next turn, and a laid break.

 Third
        Ball Options
      

        For the vast majority of players, if they manage to hit in on the third
        turn of the game, they will and should be looking to make a dream leave
        (see top of page) or similar, possibly with red near the peg and blue &
        black with a rush towards it. There are exceptions to this line of play,
        mainly with supershot openings, but unless otherwise stated, the
        standard play would be to try and set a dream leave.
      

Response to WB tice after EB opening

          Realistically, black will not be attempting to make any break on turn
          3 if it manages to hit in. The player of black has to make a judgement
          call on their likelihood of hitting the standard tice vs their
          opponent's likelihood of missing it.
        


            If the tice is long, the best response is probably to shoot black at
            blue from A baulk. Missing black at blue leaves the free shot at the
            tice for yellow of course, which does give yellow fairly good
            prospects if hit. If the tice is extremely long, say peg-high, then
            black could quite feasibly just lag at blue and attempt to leave a
            rush to red. Bear in mind that playing this lag so early in the game
            may be difficult as you may not have the pace of the court - and
            there is a risk that lagging at blue and falling short will leave
            yellow a double target on turn 4.
          

            Another option if black is uncertain, would be to shoot at blue from
            C3, and missing through to C4. This hedges black's bets somewhat, as
            it is still taking a shot at a ball and still somewhat joining with
            partner ball, but does not give good break prospects to the opponent
            if yellow hits, due to the proximity of blue and black to one
            another. Yellow is faced with a long takeoff from red towards blue
            and black and in all likelihood will not get a rush to H1 from this
            position.
          

            The third option is of course to shoot at the tice itself. Hitting
            red will give the opportunity to make a dream leave (as shown at the
            top of the page). Missing red will send black towards C2, which will
            give black a free shot back through red and yellow if yellow misses
            its fourth-turn shot at red.
          





              Some common third-ball responses to a standard tice
            


Response to C2 ball after EB opening

          There are two common options after a second-turn C2 ball - both
          consist of shooting at partner. If partner is hit, then usually the
          play will be to take off to the red in C2, roquet it and then croquet
          it either into the centre of the court, or along the west boundary,
          then lag back to partner and leave a rush in-court. However, consider
          a game where you are the stronger player playing a very capable weaker
          player, if you do hit partner third turn, you can elect to just set a
          rush to the C2 ball instead of trying to retrieve it from C2. As the
          stronger player you may prefer this line of play, instead of digging
          out the C2 ball only for your opponent to hit on turn 4 and have an
          easy break.
        

          Usually the third-turn shot at partner with black will be from A
          baulk, joining up on the east boundary if missed. This leaves a long
          double target for yellow from the end of B baulk. A more defensive
          play would be to shoot at partner from C3 into C4. Doing this leaves
          almost no break prospects fourth-turn for yellow but, depending on the
          distance between blue and black, may give them the opportunity to join
          up.
        

          Another option for black on turn 3 would be to shoot at red in C2 -
          however usually this is only a viable option if red is exactly in the
          corner, as it will mean that missing red on the right leaves no double
          target for yellow. Alternatively, another option would be for black to
          join up with red near C2, about 3-4 feet south of it. Doing so leaves
          no double target from B baulk and gives good break prospects to black
          if yellow misses the 13 yarder, although it must be remembered that
          yellow also has good prospects if it hits the 13 yarder. Black joining
          up with red also leaves a defensive shot for yellow at blue from C3 to
          C4 which, if missed, leaves black a very long and tricky takeoff from
          C2 to the east boundary.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a C2 ball
            


Response to C2 / C4 ball after Supershot opening

          The third-turn response to this option depends greatly on your ability
          and also the ability of your opponent. Before you lay the supershot,
          you need to ask yourself "am I realistically good enough to play a
          third-turn break to 4-back?". If the answer is no, then that does not
          mean that the supershot opening is a bad idea at all, but it just
          means that you may want to reassess your third-turn response.
          Additionally, if you are playing someone that you believe is much
          better than you are, then trying to give yourself a 4-ball break on
          turn 5 is exactly what you should be trying to achieve. Therefore,
          instead of trying to roquet the 13 yard shot of black at red just
          south of C2 (or just north of C4), you can instead look to join up
          with the ball 3-4 feet away, ensuring to leave no double target. This
          puts a great deal of pressure on your stronger opponent to then hit a
          13 yarder or else concede a 4-ball break to you.
        

          If you believe you are good enough to hit on turn 3 and play a break,
          then the answer is simple - hit red near C2 and go round.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / C2 ball
            


Response to EB ball after Supershot opening

          In most cases, the third-turn response to a max distance ball is to
          try and hit it from C3, missing into C4. Again, however, you should
          evaluate your own likelihood of playing a break to 4-back with only 3
          balls on the lawn if you hit, and so you may want to consider lagging
          to the ball, a couple of yards in-lawn from the east boundary.
        

          If the ball on the east boundary is south of the peg, it is tempting
          to simply shoot at it from A baulk. Missing will of course leave a
          double from B baulk, but the odds of yellow then hitting a double
          target from 20+ yards is no certainty. Alternatively, if the
          second-turn ball is around peg-high, then shooting at it from B baulk
          from a few yards west of C3 and missing often results in a fairly even
          spread of the balls, with your black ball being approximately 8 yards
          south of red and 8 yards north of C4. This again is technically a
          double target from somewhere on B Baulk, but given the distance
          between red and black, is easily missed and will leave your black ball
          a shot of only 8 yards.

              ball
            


Response to C4 ball after EB opening

          This opening creates one of the more interesting third-turn decisions.
          A second-turn ball 6" north of C4 is a very threatening position and
          therefore the options will as follows:
        


            Shoot at partner
            
Hit - set a dream leave

                Miss - leaves yellow a 13-yard shot at red in C4 for a 4-ball
                break
              



            Shoot at opponent near C4 from A baulk
            

                Hit - set a dream leave (you may want to have a go at gaining a
                rush to H1 on partner)
              

                Miss - leave a 13-yard double for yellow (but slightly tricky
                break pick-up)
              



            Join up with opponent near C4, leaving no double
            

                If red is 3-6" north of C4 - join a yard north of it from A
                baulk
                
No short double target is left for yellow

                    Yellow still only has a 13-yard shot for the innings (but a
                    slightly tricky break pick-up)
                  



                If red is ~12" north of C4 - shoot from C3 through to C4
                

                    Enables black to have a shot (albeit very long) to attempt
                    to hit and set a dream leave
                  




Black to C2


              By burying itself in C2, this enables black to kill off the
              aggression by red and yellow. Any miss by yellow will leave a 9
              yarder (at most) for blue
            






              Some common third-ball responses to a C4 ball
            



          A personal preference of mine is to shoot third-turn at the ball near
          C4 from A baulk, because hitting gives me control of the court, and I
          miss often enough by more than several inches so as not to leave a
          double.
        

          Be on the lookout for cannons around C4 as part of this opening -
          there is often a good opportunity to bombard a live ball across to H1
          while playing a croquet stroke towards blue on the east boundary. This
          can make picking up the first break a great deal easier.
        
Response to duffer tice after EB opening

          The duffer tice is one of my favourite openings. Because of the
          placement of red near H6, a miss by black from the end of B baulk will
          be headed towards A baulk and give an easy start for yellow. That is
          why we see the ~9 yard shot at red refused so often, even by very
          strong players!
        

          If black does decide to shoot at the duffer and hits, then not a great
          deal of options are available other than to take off to partner ball
          (usually nudging red towards the peg in the process), and leave a rush
          towards red, and then hope for a fourth-turn miss by yellow.
        

          Another option for shooting at the duffer is doing so from C3,
          shooting across the court and missing to around peg-high (or just
          south of peg-high) on the west boundary. This is the most defensive
          shot available in that a miss gives no break to yellow if yellow hits
          red, but it also does not put any pressure on yellow's shot at red.
          Often times, when black misses the shot from C3 at red, it will end up
          south of peg-high on the west boundary and be a tempting free shot for
          yellow from C1.
        

          Shooting at partner ball on turn 3 is the most aggressive line of play
          - taking the shot from A baulk and hitting gives the opportunity to
          play a big croquet stroke loading partner to H2 and attempting to get
          a rush to H1 on the duffer ball - it is a big shot and the break
          chances are normally only reasonable for very strong players. Missing
          partner from A baulk on the other hand gives yellow a ~9 yard shot and
          very strong break prospects. It is therefore more usual to see black
          shoot at blue from C3 which, although longer, doesn't make all the
          balls available to yellow if black misses blue and yellow hits red. It
          also means that blue and black maintain a wide join and have realistic
          prospects of hitting back in if yellow misses red.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a duffer tice
            


Response to 2 balls on EB

          If red has shot at blue on turn 2 and missed, leaving both balls on
          the east boundary, you should carefully evaluate your response based
          on the strength of your opponent. If you and your opponent are evenly
          matched but not world class players, or especially if your opponent is
          a much stronger player than you, then the best thing to do here may be
          to simply ignore the two balls on the east boundary and lag black into
          the middle of the court and wait for yellow to miss. This potentially
          presents you with an immediate break with a ball in the middle of the
          court.
        

          In a match between two very strong players it would be unusual to see
          no shot taken on turn 3, and if hit, some attempt at digging out a
          3-ball break.
        
Response to 2 balls in-court

          In a situation where you have laid a supershot with blue, and red has
          lagged a couple of yards north east of your supershot ball, if there
          is no double target to be had from anywhere on the baulk lines, you
          must again consider your expectations after hitting third turn vs your
          opponent's likelihood of hitting fourth turn. As with previous
          options, if you are playing an opponent who on paper is a much
          stronger player, the percentage play is usually to lag the black ball
          into the middle of the court beside the other two balls (being mindful
          not to leave a double target from anywhere), which will put pressure
          on your stronger opponent to hit in or else concede the first break
          opportunity to you.
        

          If you do want to shoot with black at one of the balls in the middle,
          then consider either shooting at the easterly ball from C1 (you may
          even be able to shoot hard at this without missing to B baulk), or
          alternatively shooting at a medium pace at either blue or red from the
          closest point on A baulk. If you do shoot from the closest point, be
          sure to hit at a pace to finish slightly south of H6, both so that
          black is not a short shot from B baulk, and so that any double target
          that you leave has plenty of space between the front and back ball.
        

          If you are facing a third turn shot with black after red has
          cross-wired blue and red at the peg, check first to see if there is a
          point which you can lag to where blue won't be wired from black, and
          which won't be giving a double target from either baulk line - if
          there is such a spot, then that is the best place to lag to.

 Fourth Ball Options
      

The fourth-turn response is usually actually more simple than then third-turn response - although there are more possible scenarios, they almost always result in yellow trying to roquet something.  
      

Response to ignored WB tice
When black has ignored a standard west boundary tice and insetad shot at (and missed) partner on the east boundary, the obvious response is to then try and hit red yourself from C1.  If the placement of red is good, you should have ~50% chance of hitting in.  Your break prospects after hitting red are actually quite good, as you will play a take off from red to blue & black, which will automatically be sending red towards H2 as a pioneer.  On the other hand, a miss with yellow through red into C2 only gives fairly mediocre break prospects to blue & black in the next turn.
Response to missed WB tice
If black did indeed shoot at red (and miss) from C1 in the previous turn, then the obvious response is to shoot at red yourself, but from a point east of C1 so that a miss will leave yellow joined with red.  If you hit red, your best line of play would be to roll red &  yellow towards C1 and lay a rush for your next turn.  A miss from red at yellow will of course leave black a shot through red and yellow from C2 to C1 but is likely to be a very long shot at a single ball target.  A miss from black on turn 5 here also gives you a good chance at establishing a break on turn 5.  




              If black has missed the standard tice, it leaves a good opportunity to join up with red on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C2 ball after EB opening
Having played red into C2 on turn 2, if black ignores red and simply joins with blue (which is likely), then against most players your best line of play would be to shoot at blue and black with red.  Whether you shoot from A baulk or B baulk depends on factors such as the distance between blue and black (whether it is easy to make a double target from B baulk or A baulk) and the flatness of the east boundary.  If the black ball missed blue badly on the left on turn 3, blue and black may well be 2+ yards apart on the east boundary, so there is a defensive option available to yellow as well - shoot from C3 through to C4, where a miss would not give blue & black any easy opening.
If you are the weaker player against a very strong opponent, then there is a case for shooting yellow at red - at 13 yards, it is significantly shorter than any other available shot and is therefore your best chance at winning the opening.  Red missing yellow gives blue a relatively easy start and a probable break, but against a very strong opponent it can still be worth the risk.  




              Fourth-turn responses for yellow when partner is in C2 and opponent balls are on the east boundary.  
            


Response to joined / missed C2 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, if black has for some reason shot at red in C2, then assuming a double target has been left, your best aggressive option is to shoot at this, preferably hitting the northern ball, from B baulk.  A hit or a miss here will give fairly good break prospects to whomever plays the next shot, given C2's proximity to H2 - a semi-good pioneer can usually be sent to H2 while obtaining a rush to H1.
If black has instead joined up a yard south of red on turn 2, you have no double target (except from C1, but let's not consider that).  Now you have fundamentally two options - either shoot yellow at red which will give a good break opportunity if hit (and concede a good break opportunity to black if missed), or take a more defensive line by shooting yellow at blue from C3 into C4.  If yellow misses this shot, it does give black a 1-yard roquet at red for the innings, however it not only gives no break prospects, but also requires black to play several good strokes in order to have a good leave.  Black's take off from C2 to blue on the east boundary is a difficult shot, and if black doesn't succeed in roqueting blue in its next shot (either taking off short and missing blue, or taking off too far and sending black out) then yellow will have a 9-10 yard shot at blue & black from near C4.




              If black has joined a yard south of red near C2, the yellow has aggressive and defensive options available
            


Response to missed EB ball after Supershot opening
The response here depends a lot on both the length of the supershot ball and what option black chose on turn 3.  Firstly let's assume the most common scenario, with blue halfway between H5 and peg, and 1-2 yards west of the centre line, and red approximately peg high on the EB, and black in or near C4.  In this situation the best option is normally to shoot at red from A baulk, with a miss joining up around 1 yard north of it.  This leaves blue a 15-yarder at red & yellow but difficult break prospects for both players, whomever plays the next shot. 




              The common response after a third-turn miss by black at red to C4, is for yellow to shoot at red, joining if missing.  An aggressive line is to shoot at black.  A third option is yellow at blue, which is shorter and will win you the innings, but only gives good break prospects if red and black are near to each other
            


As the weaker player against a stronger player, a very aggressive line of play would be to shoot yellow from A baulk at black in C4 - this is very black and white, as a hit will give you a good chance for a 4-ball break and a miss will give black the same chance.  As the weaker player, you can strongly consider this option.  
Consider for a moment that black's third-turn shot missed red from A baulk, or perhaps missed red from west of C3, finishing 5-10 yards south of red.  In this case, yellow for look for possible double targets available from B baulk.  Consider, too, the shortest shot available, which is yellow at blue from A baulk - this is likely a 11-13 yard shot which, if hit, gives good break prospects to yellow because red and black are close together.
Response to ignored duffer tice
The vast majority of the time the best response to black ignoring red's duffer tice, is for yellow to shoot hard at red from B baulk.  Usually a duffer tice is only 9-10 yards and so it will be, by far, the shortest shot for yellow.




              The majority of the time, the fourth turn response would be to shoot yellow at the duffer.  Against a very strong player, you might be tempted by yellow at black in C4 which, although 3 yards longer, gives an easy start to your break
            


An expection to this would be if blue & black are joined on the east boundary leaving a good double target from A baulk, and so you may want to consider shooting at that instead.  Another option to consider is if black shot and missed blue from C3 to C4.  If you are playing against a much stronger opponent you may consider shooting yellow at black from A baulk into C4.  This shot is 3 yards longer than yellow at red from B baulk, but hitting this shot gives you vastly stronger break prospects than if you hit red first.
Response to missed duffer tice
If black misses the duffer tice (red) gently, the logical response is to shoot hard at either red from B baulk or black from A baulk (whichever is closer).  If black misses the duffer tice from C3 across to the west boundary, you may consider shooting at black from C1 through to C2, particularly if black is south of peg-high.  




              If the duffer tice is still in its original position at the start of turn 4, the general response is for yellow to shoot at red given its proximity to B baulk.  If black missed red from C3 however, it can be tempting to shoot at black from C1 on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C4 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, red a few inches north of C4 and black 1 yard north of blue, yellow's default response should be to shoot at red from A baulk.  Hitting this shot gives a great break opportunity, as it is a very natural stroke to croquet red to H2 while approaching blue & black up the east boundary.  
Response to 3 balls on EB
In this instance, you simply need to hit one of the balls on the east boundary - from either A baulk or B baulk, depending on length and available targets.
Response to 3 balls in-court
A supershot opening with lags by red and black essentially forces yellow to shoot at the closest ball.  A very black and white opening, good break prospects for both players on turn 4 or 5, depending on whether yellow hits or misses.  Often times, black will have take a gentle lag while attempting a roquet at either blue or red on turn 3, so this may also give yellow some target to shoot at on turn 4.

Conclusion
If you have gotten to the bottom of this article, you have probably realised by now that the number of opening options are vast.  This article could not hope to cover every eventuality, and nor does it present any new or unseen openings; rather it serves to talk through the options and thought processes for choosing a particular option, and I hope it has been useful.

Openings

        The opening is the battle between the two sides to be the first to gain
        the upper hand. Generally when we talk about openings in croquet, we are
        referring to the first 4 turns. At the very top level it is where games
        are won and lost, but at all levels it provides a fascinating array of
        options for bluffing and double-bluffing your opponent.
      
Opening priorities
As the stronger player

        The stronger player who is playing a dangerous but less experienced /
        weaker player will generally approach the opening with the intent of not
        giving away an easy break, and hence a more defensive mindset. Openings
        where there is a lot of grey area, balls on boundaries and in corners
        are best for this. The stronger player will generally rely on their
        better all-round game in order to win, and is more comfortable with
        digging balls out slowly into a break.
      
As the weaker player

        The weaker player should approach a game against a much stronger
        opponent with an attacking mindset - they will not be afraid to take on
        relatively short shots that give laid breaks, even if it means conceding
        a laid break if they miss. The weaker player should favour openings that
        have balls in-lawn and should be looking to put pressure on the stronger
        player to have to hit in.
      
Evenly-matched players

        It is quite common to see very aggressive, black and white, openings
        when two very strong players play against each other. The same is true
        for openings between evenly-matched players at lower levels, but
        generally to a lesser extent. A lot of the opening strategy depends on
        the individual mindset of the player, with some players naturally
        playing a more attacking game than others.
      

        Below are articles on various well-known (and some not-so-well-known)
        openings, which discuss options for placement of balls, and responses to
        them. For the purposes of simplicity, in the examples below, the balls
        will always be played in the following order:
      


 Blue
        

 Red
        


          Black
        


          Yellow
        


Note: there is no ball order or sequence in which the balls need to
          be added to the game in croquet - the above order is simply to keep
          things consistent for the diagrams and explanations.


        As you can probably imagine, the options in the opening are endless.
        This article attempts to talk through some of the most common options,
        and some of the most common responses to them, with the idea of
        clarifying some of the thought processes behind them.
      

The Dream Leave

        Many of the openings below will reference something known as the Dream
        Leave - this is a scenario where the third turn ball (black) has hit and
        arranged the court as follows:
      




            Black hit on turn 3 and set a dream leave
          



        Black has retrieved red from wherever it was on the court and placed it
        slightly in-lawn from the west boundary, north of peg-high, and left
        blue a rush to it from the east boundary. This leave gives no short shot
        for yellow, and any miss by yellow will give blue a good break
        opportunity.

 First
        Ball Options
      

East Boundary

          The most common option selected by the first ball player. A ball to
          the east boundary, somewhere between level with H4 and H5, is chosen
          due to its relative distance from both baulk lines and from H1. It is
          a completely non-threatening ball and allows the second ball player to
          dictate the nature of the game, be it defensive or aggressive.
        
In-lawn East Boundary ball

          A variation on the standard east boundary ball, the in-lawn east
          boundary ball is struck out in the same area as the standard east
          boundary ball, but purposefully left about 1 yard in from the yardline
          area. The idea behind that is so that black can play its third turn
          shot out behind blue and leave itself a rush in-court. This play
          discourages responses like a west boundary tice from red.
        
Supershot

          A supershot ball is a first-turn ball placed near the middle of the
          court, normally between H5 and peg and a couple of yards west of the
          centre line. This is the most aggressive sensible option for the first
          ball, and signals your intent to your opponent that you want no grey
          area. Given its proximity to H1, a supershot ball generally gives a
          good chance for a break for either player, depending on whether the
          third-turn, fourth-turn or fifth-turn shots are hit.
        

          There are variations on the length of the supershot, with a supershot
          played to near the peg being a poorer pioneer for H1 but having the
          advantage of lengthening any fourth-turn shot by yellow at it.
        
Anti-duffer

          This opening is an attempt to try and pre-empt the second-turn
          response and discourage a "duffer tice" by red. To lay an anti-duffer,
          you hit blue to a spot somewhere between H6 and the peg, and 1-2 yards
          west of the east boundary. The idea of placing a ball here is that if
          the opponent were to lay a duffer tice with red,
          then it gives black a good chance to hit red and take off behind blue
          for a rush to H1 on turn 3. It is a leave that is generally only used
          by strong players who have a realistic chance of a third-turn break in
          the first place.
        




              Some common first-ball scenarios
            


Unusual first-turn options

          The croquet court is a big place and so there really are endless
          options for where to place balls in the opening. Often an unusual
          option first-turn will yield good results by confusing the opponent!
        
C4 first ball

          Not often seen these days due to a preference for an east boundary
          ball 10 yards further north. A weakness of this opening is that
          shooting at partner on turn 3 and missing is liable to leave a double
          target for yellow. It also generally encourages yellow to take an
          aggressive shot on turn 4; however on a difficult lawn this opening
          can have some advantages, with any hit by yellow on turn 4 at balls in
          C4 leaving little room to promote balls into the court due to the
          close proximity to the corner.
        
C2 first ball

          Playing blue into C2 first turn can often catch the opponent off
          guard. This opening attempts to flip the tables on red and yellow by
          trying to ensure a defensive opening for blue and black. This can be a
          good option where blue and black are the stronger players and want to
          prevent aggressive second-turn options by red and yellow. Of course,
          there are options available to red and yellow which negate blue and
          black's defensive preferences.
        
Micro tice

          As unusual options go, this is right up there. This option would not
          be recommended when playing a strong player, but nevertheless is very
          interesting. The micro tice is a ball played from the end of A baulk
          towards the east boundary, but only 2-3 yards towards it, leaving a
          2-3 yard roquet for the opponent on the second turn. This length of
          shot cannot really be refused, but leaving red a croquet stroke from
          south-west of hoop 4 on the second turn of the game gives no real
          break prospects. Often the second turn player will attempt an approach
          to H1 and fail it, leaving a 6-yard roquet with two balls near H1 for
          black. This opening relies more on a tactical mistake from red than
          anything else
        
C1 / C3 opening

          Occasionally seen. Not a good opening against any experienced
          opponent, but occasionally yields results. This first-turn option is
          not to be recommended. A first-turn ball in C1 followed by a
          second-turn response to C3 (or vice versa) is a killer blow to black's
          turn.

 Second
        Ball Options
      


          This is where things start to get a little interesting. For the most
          part, the opening is dictated by the second ball response, and there
          are many more options available.
        
Response to East Boundary ball
Standard Tice

          The standard tice is one of the most popular responses to an east
          boundary ball at club-level croquet. Although in recent years it has
          fallen out of favour with top players (likely due to an increase in
          the standard of shooting), it is still a great opening that gives good
          chances to both sides.
        

          The standard tice is where red is played to the west boundary, and the
          distance it is placed north of C1 needs to be carefully considered by
          the striker or red. The name "tice" indicates that the distance should
          be enticing for the player of black to shoot at and so a distance of
          between about 8 and 13 yards is common. As a general rule, if possible
          the distance chosen should either be about 1 yard longer than the
          opponent's critical distance (the distance at which someone hits 50%
          of their shots) or 1 yard shorter (or equal to) your own critical
          distance. Obviously this cannot be achieved if your opponent has a
          longer critical distance than you do, so it is better to err slightly
          on the longer side.
        

          If blue is an in-lawn east boundary ball, laying a standard tice is
          risky, as black can quite easily lay a rush directly to it on the
          third turn.
        
C2 ball

          Probably the most common response to the east boundary ball today is
          the second-turn ball to 6" south of C2. The reason for playing just
          south of C2 is that if in the unlikely event of black shooting at red
          on turn 3, a miss will likely leave yellow a double target. The idea
          of red near C2 means that red is buried in a defensive position, and
          signals yellow's intent to shoot at blue and black on turn 4.
        

          If blue is slightly in-lawn, then C2 is the safest and most defensive
          response with red.
        
Duffer tice

          One of the more aggressive responses for red is the duffer tice. This
          is a ball that is placed usually about 2-feet north and a few inches
          east of penultimate. This is similarly enticing for the opponent to
          shoot (just as with a standard tice) but in this case a miss is
          usually more critical - any third turn shot at the duffer is in the
          direction of A baulk so black usually takes the shot gently - and by
          doing so is more likely to miss. Black missing leaves two balls in the
          centre of the court, giving yellow a great chance on turn 4. The
          duffer tice is a great option for weaker players playing against
          stronger players, and also for anyone confident in hitting 10 yarders.
        

          Between two very strong players a duffer tice is still a popular
          opening. There are variations on the placement of the ball near
          penult, based on the strength of the opponent. It is common to see a
          duffer tice placed level with, or south of, H6, particularly if the
          striker of red and yellow is a very good shot and is confident to hit
          an 11-yarder on turn 4. In a game between experts, the placement of
          red is sometimes moved to the west of H6 to discourage a third-turn
          break after a hit from black at blue.
        
C4 ball

          This option is very popular in New Zealand and although a mirror image
          of the C2 ball, is a lot more aggressive. Placing red 6" north of C4
          not only gives negligible break prospects to black on turn 3 but also
          signals your intent to hit fourth-turn with yellow and have a break. A
          miss at partner by black on turn 3 gives you a 13-yard shot for a
          4-ball break, and a miss by black at red on turn 3 usually gives a
          double target.
        
Shoot at first-turn ball

          A slightly counter-intuitive option but nonetheless an interesting
          one. Shooting red at blue on turn 2 and hitting gives no break
          prospects, but a miss also leaves very slim break prospects for black
          on turn 3 if it hits, unless black is a very strong player. With this
          opening it is quite common to see misses on both turns 2 and 3, and
          often a triple target for yellow at the other 3 balls on turn 4 from B
          baulk.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to east boundary opening
            


Response to Supershot ball

          The supershot ball is the most aggressive opening that the first-turn
          player can use. There are several responses to this which need to be
          considered, based on your assessment of your opponent's ability and
          whether the opponent has realistic prospects of a break to 4-back if
          they do manage to hit 3rd turn.
        
C2 response

          The C2 response is a ball played about 6" south of C2. This is a
          strong response to a supershot against almost all players. If the
          player of black wants to attempt a third-turn break, they will have to
          hit a 13-yarder and play a very difficult croquet stroke out of C2 to
          get a rush to H1, and this is by no means guaranteed. On the other
          hand, a miss by black at red on turn 3 will leave yellow a double
          target and a 4-ball break if hit.
        




              It is important to finish a few inches south of C2 with red as it
              will mean black missing on either side of it will leave a double
              target. Above is a comparison of yellow's target after a
              third-turn miss by black at red, firstly with red in C2 and
              secondly with red a few inches south of C2
            



          There are only a handful of players in the world where the C2 ball is
          not a great response - players who would expect to hit the 13 yarder
          most of the time and also be good enough at croquet strokes to expect
          to get a rush to H1 on the supershot ball. Against these players the
          strategy of lengthing the 3rd turn shot would be preferred.
        
C4 response

          Mirror image to the C2 response, this ball is played 6" north of C4.
          Consider this if blue (the supershot ball) is placed further north
          than normal (somewhere near peg-high), or is in a particular spot
          which may have H4 obscuring any croquet stroke from C4 towards it. It
          otherwise gives all the same advantages as the C2 response
        
Max Distance response

          As a counter to the very top players hitting the ball in C2 most of
          the time, the max distance response became popular - this is where red
          is played to the east boundary about level with the peg on the east
          boundary, leaving the longest shot possible for black. This response
          grants black a shot from C3 through red and into C4, reducing yellow's
          fourth-turn prospects - it relies more on black missing red than
          trying to make any break pick-up by black more difficult. Generally a
          good option against the very best players, but against most players is
          unnecessary.  
The reason why max distance on the east boundary is chosen instead of the equivalent max distance spot on the west boundary is that it is slightly further from the supershot ball (blue), which is slightly south-west of the peg.  Assuming that the shots on turns 3 and 4 are missed, blue's shot at red & yellow on the east boundary will be a couple of yards longer than the equivalent shot to the west boundary.  
Supershot lag

          The response for red to lag to a spot 3-4 yards east and 1-2 yards
          north of the supershot ball is a very strong and very under-used
          response to the supershot. This is a good tactic when playing someone
          who is a very good shot, and in particular if the supershot ball
          itself is quite deep (nearer the peg than H5). Placing red beside blue
          nullifies the strength of black's shooting by encouraging black to
          take its third turn shot gently (which is generally less accurate), or
          risk shooting hard and missing into B baulk, conceding a 4-ball break.
          In this case, black may choose not to shoot at all, and instead also
          lag to a position wide of the other two balls, meaning that red and
          yellow have successfully turned the tables of the supershot opening
          and enabled yellow to have the first attempted roquet.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to supershot opening
            


Roquet the Supershot ball

          The ultimate way to nullify the supershot ball - roquet it on the
          second turn. After roqueting blue with red, there are several options
          available. You can croquet blue towards C2 and then fire red off 6"
          north of C4. A more aggressive option would be to croquet blue
          north-west of H2 and fire red off the south boundary, south of H4 -
          this leaves black a choice of 7-8 yarders but minimal break prospects
          and difficult strokes with their third turn in order to distance the
          balls from baulk. A more novel option would be to crosswire blue and
          red at the peg, which leaves only a 17-yard shot for black with a
          baulk line in the background. An even more interesting option might be
          to roll blue close to the peg, either east or west, and then play red
          a yard or two away from it, wiring blue's backswing at red. This means
          that black probably has no lag option towards blue that doesn't leave
          a double-target for yellow.
        
Response to unusual first-turn options
Response to a first-turn C2 ball

          A first-turn C2 ball is an attempt by blue to make red conform to a
          defensive opening. Red could of course do this if it wants, by playing
          6" north of C4, or even by just having a "standard" east boundary
          ball; however a better option to negate blue's attempt at dictating
          the opening might be to set a duffer tice - this is the ultimate
          aggressive response to the C2 ball, and means that black is suddenly
          faced with having to hit a 10-13 yarder on turn 3 or risk leaving the
          same for yellow next turn, and a laid break.
        
Back to top



 Third
        Ball Options
      

        For the vast majority of players, if they manage to hit in on the third
        turn of the game, they will and should be looking to make a dream leave
        (see top of page) or similar, possibly with red near the peg and blue &
        black with a rush towards it. There are exceptions to this line of play,
        mainly with supershot openings, but unless otherwise stated, the
        standard play would be to try and set a dream leave.
      

Response to WB tice after EB opening

          Realistically, black will not be attempting to make any break on turn
          3 if it manages to hit in. The player of black has to make a judgement
          call on their likelihood of hitting the standard tice vs their
          opponent's likelihood of missing it.
        


            If the tice is long, the best response is probably to shoot black at
            blue from A baulk. Missing black at blue leaves the free shot at the
            tice for yellow of course, which does give yellow fairly good
            prospects if hit. If the tice is extremely long, say peg-high, then
            black could quite feasibly just lag at blue and attempt to leave a
            rush to red. Bear in mind that playing this lag so early in the game
            may be difficult as you may not have the pace of the court - and
            there is a risk that lagging at blue and falling short will leave
            yellow a double target on turn 4.
          

            Another option if black is uncertain, would be to shoot at blue from
            C3, and missing through to C4. This hedges black's bets somewhat, as
            it is still taking a shot at a ball and still somewhat joining with
            partner ball, but does not give good break prospects to the opponent
            if yellow hits, due to the proximity of blue and black to one
            another. Yellow is faced with a long takeoff from red towards blue
            and black and in all likelihood will not get a rush to H1 from this
            position.
          

            The third option is of course to shoot at the tice itself. Hitting
            red will give the opportunity to make a dream leave (as shown at the
            top of the page). Missing red will send black towards C2, which will
            give black a free shot back through red and yellow if yellow misses
            its fourth-turn shot at red.
          





              Some common third-ball responses to a standard tice
            


Response to C2 ball after EB opening

          There are two common options after a second-turn C2 ball - both
          consist of shooting at partner. If partner is hit, then usually the
          play will be to take off to the red in C2, roquet it and then croquet
          it either into the centre of the court, or along the west boundary,
          then lag back to partner and leave a rush in-court. However, consider
          a game where you are the stronger player playing a very capable weaker
          player, if you do hit partner third turn, you can elect to just set a
          rush to the C2 ball instead of trying to retrieve it from C2. As the
          stronger player you may prefer this line of play, instead of digging
          out the C2 ball only for your opponent to hit on turn 4 and have an
          easy break.
        

          Usually the third-turn shot at partner with black will be from A
          baulk, joining up on the east boundary if missed. This leaves a long
          double target for yellow from the end of B baulk. A more defensive
          play would be to shoot at partner from C3 into C4. Doing this leaves
          almost no break prospects fourth-turn for yellow but, depending on the
          distance between blue and black, may give them the opportunity to join
          up.
        

          Another option for black on turn 3 would be to shoot at red in C2 -
          however usually this is only a viable option if red is exactly in the
          corner, as it will mean that missing red on the right leaves no double
          target for yellow. Alternatively, another option would be for black to
          join up with red near C2, about 3-4 feet south of it. Doing so leaves
          no double target from B baulk and gives good break prospects to black
          if yellow misses the 13 yarder, although it must be remembered that
          yellow also has good prospects if it hits the 13 yarder. Black joining
          up with red also leaves a defensive shot for yellow at blue from C3 to
          C4 which, if missed, leaves black a very long and tricky takeoff from
          C2 to the east boundary.

Response to C2 / C4 ball after Supershot opening

          The third-turn response to this option depends greatly on your ability
          and also the ability of your opponent. Before you lay the supershot,
          you need to ask yourself "am I realistically good enough to play a
          third-turn break to 4-back?". If the answer is no, then that does not
          mean that the supershot opening is a bad idea at all, but it just
          means that you may want to reassess your third-turn response.
          Additionally, if you are playing someone that you believe is much
          better than you are, then trying to give yourself a 4-ball break on
          turn 5 is exactly what you should be trying to achieve. Therefore,
          instead of trying to roquet the 13 yard shot of black at red just
          south of C2 (or just north of C4), you can instead look to join up
          with the ball 3-4 feet away, ensuring to leave no double target. This
          puts a great deal of pressure on your stronger opponent to then hit a
          13 yarder or else concede a 4-ball break to you.
        

          If you believe you are good enough to hit on turn 3 and play a break,
          then the answer is simple - hit red near C2 and go round.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / C2 ball
            


Response to EB ball after Supershot opening

          In most cases, the third-turn response to a max distance ball is to
          try and hit it from C3, missing into C4. Again, however, you should
          evaluate your own likelihood of playing a break to 4-back with only 3
          balls on the lawn if you hit, and so you may want to consider lagging
          to the ball, a couple of yards in-lawn from the east boundary.
        

          If the ball on the east boundary is south of the peg, it is tempting
          to simply shoot at it from A baulk. Missing will of course leave a
          double from B baulk, but the odds of yellow then hitting a double
          target from 20+ yards is no certainty. Alternatively, if the
          second-turn ball is around peg-high, then shooting at it from B baulk
          from a few yards west of C3 and missing often results in a fairly even
          spread of the balls, with your black ball being approximately 8 yards
          south of red and 8 yards north of C4. This again is technically a
          double target from somewhere on B Baulk, but given the distance
          between red and black, is easily missed and will leave your black ball
          a shot of only 8 yards.

Response to C4 ball after EB opening

          This opening creates one of the more interesting third-turn decisions.
          A second-turn ball 6" north of C4 is a very threatening position and
          therefore the options will as follows:
        


            Shoot at partner
            
Hit - set a dream leave

                Miss - leaves yellow a 13-yard shot at red in C4 for a 4-ball
                break
              



            Shoot at opponent near C4 from A baulk
            

                Hit - set a dream leave (you may want to have a go at gaining a
                rush to H1 on partner)
              

                Miss - leave a 13-yard double for yellow (but slightly tricky
                break pick-up)
              



            Join up with opponent near C4, leaving no double
            

                If red is 3-6" north of C4 - join a yard north of it from A
                baulk
                
No short double target is left for yellow

                    Yellow still only has a 13-yard shot for the innings (but a
                    slightly tricky break pick-up)
                  



                If red is ~12" north of C4 - shoot from C3 through to C4
                

                    Enables black to have a shot (albeit very long) to attempt
                    to hit and set a dream leave
                  




Black to C2


              By burying itself in C2, this enables black to kill off the
              aggression by red and yellow. Any miss by yellow will leave a 9
              yarder (at most) for blue
            






              Some common third-ball responses to a C4 ball
            



          A personal preference of mine is to shoot third-turn at the ball near
          C4 from A baulk, because hitting gives me control of the court, and I
          miss often enough by more than several inches so as not to leave a
          double.
        

          Be on the lookout for cannons around C4 as part of this opening -
          there is often a good opportunity to bombard a live ball across to H1
          while playing a croquet stroke towards blue on the east boundary. This
          can make picking up the first break a great deal easier.
        
Response to duffer tice after EB opening

          The duffer tice is one of my favourite openings. Because of the
          placement of red near H6, a miss by black from the end of B baulk will
          be headed towards A baulk and give an easy start for yellow. That is
          why we see the ~9 yard shot at red refused so often, even by very
          strong players!
        

          If black does decide to shoot at the duffer and hits, then not a great
          deal of options are available other than to take off to partner ball
          (usually nudging red towards the peg in the process), and leave a rush
          towards red, and then hope for a fourth-turn miss by yellow.
        

          Another option for shooting at the duffer is doing so from C3,
          shooting across the court and missing to around peg-high (or just
          south of peg-high) on the west boundary. This is the most defensive
          shot available in that a miss gives no break to yellow if yellow hits
          red, but it also does not put any pressure on yellow's shot at red.
          Often times, when black misses the shot from C3 at red, it will end up
          south of peg-high on the west boundary and be a tempting free shot for
          yellow from C1.
        

          Shooting at partner ball on turn 3 is the most aggressive line of play
          - taking the shot from A baulk and hitting gives the opportunity to
          play a big croquet stroke loading partner to H2 and attempting to get
          a rush to H1 on the duffer ball - it is a big shot and the break
          chances are normally only reasonable for very strong players. Missing
          partner from A baulk on the other hand gives yellow a ~9 yard shot and
          very strong break prospects. It is therefore more usual to see black
          shoot at blue from C3 which, although longer, doesn't make all the
          balls available to yellow if black misses blue and yellow hits red. It
          also means that blue and black maintain a wide join and have realistic
          prospects of hitting back in if yellow misses red.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a duffer tice
            


Response to 2 balls on EB

          If red has shot at blue on turn 2 and missed, leaving both balls on
          the east boundary, you should carefully evaluate your response based
          on the strength of your opponent. If you and your opponent are evenly
          matched but not world class players, or especially if your opponent is
          a much stronger player than you, then the best thing to do here may be
          to simply ignore the two balls on the east boundary and lag black into
          the middle of the court and wait for yellow to miss. This potentially
          presents you with an immediate break with a ball in the middle of the
          court.
        

          In a match between two very strong players it would be unusual to see
          no shot taken on turn 3, and if hit, some attempt at digging out a
          3-ball break.
        
Response to 2 balls in-court

          In a situation where you have laid a supershot with blue, and red has
          lagged a couple of yards north east of your supershot ball, if there
          is no double target to be had from anywhere on the baulk lines, you
          must again consider your expectations after hitting third turn vs your
          opponent's likelihood of hitting fourth turn. As with previous
          options, if you are playing an opponent who on paper is a much
          stronger player, the percentage play is usually to lag the black ball
          into the middle of the court beside the other two balls (being mindful
          not to leave a double target from anywhere), which will put pressure
          on your stronger opponent to hit in or else concede the first break
          opportunity to you.
        

          If you do want to shoot with black at one of the balls in the middle,
          then consider either shooting at the easterly ball from C1 (you may
          even be able to shoot hard at this without missing to B baulk), or
          alternatively shooting at a medium pace at either blue or red from the
          closest point on A baulk. If you do shoot from the closest point, be
          sure to hit at a pace to finish slightly south of H6, both so that
          black is not a short shot from B baulk, and so that any double target
          that you leave has plenty of space between the front and back ball.
        

          If you are facing a third turn shot with black after red has
          cross-wired blue and red at the peg, check first to see if there is a
          point which you can lag to where blue won't be wired from black, and
          which won't be giving a double target from either baulk line - if
          there is such a spot, then that is the best place to lag to.

 Fourth Ball Options
      

The fourth-turn response is usually actually more simple than then third-turn response - although there are more possible scenarios, they almost always result in yellow trying to roquet something.  
      

Response to ignored WB tice
When black has ignored a standard west boundary tice and insetad shot at (and missed) partner on the east boundary, the obvious response is to then try and hit red yourself from C1.  If the placement of red is good, you should have ~50% chance of hitting in.  Your break prospects after hitting red are actually quite good, as you will play a take off from red to blue & black, which will automatically be sending red towards H2 as a pioneer.  On the other hand, a miss with yellow through red into C2 only gives fairly mediocre break prospects to blue & black in the next turn.
Response to missed WB tice
If black did indeed shoot at red (and miss) from C1 in the previous turn, then the obvious response is to shoot at red yourself, but from a point east of C1 so that a miss will leave yellow joined with red.  If you hit red, your best line of play would be to roll red &  yellow towards C1 and lay a rush for your next turn.  A miss from red at yellow will of course leave black a shot through red and yellow from C2 to C1 but is likely to be a very long shot at a single ball target.  A miss from black on turn 5 here also gives you a good chance at establishing a break on turn 5.  




              If black has missed the standard tice, it leaves a good opportunity to join up with red on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C2 ball after EB opening
Having played red into C2 on turn 2, if black ignores red and simply joins with blue (which is likely), then against most players your best line of play would be to shoot at blue and black with red.  Whether you shoot from A baulk or B baulk depends on factors such as the distance between blue and black (whether it is easy to make a double target from B baulk or A baulk) and the flatness of the east boundary.  If the black ball missed blue badly on the left on turn 3, blue and black may well be 2+ yards apart on the east boundary, so there is a defensive option available to yellow as well - shoot from C3 through to C4, where a miss would not give blue & black any easy opening.
If you are the weaker player against a very strong opponent, then there is a case for shooting yellow at red - at 13 yards, it is significantly shorter than any other available shot and is therefore your best chance at winning the opening.  Red missing yellow gives blue a relatively easy start and a probable break, but against a very strong opponent it can still be worth the risk.  




              Fourth-turn responses for yellow when partner is in C2 and opponent balls are on the east boundary.  
            


Response to joined / missed C2 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, if black has for some reason shot at red in C2, then assuming a double target has been left, your best aggressive option is to shoot at this, preferably hitting the northern ball, from B baulk.  A hit or a miss here will give fairly good break prospects to whomever plays the next shot, given C2's proximity to H2 - a semi-good pioneer can usually be sent to H2 while obtaining a rush to H1.
If black has instead joined up a yard south of red on turn 2, you have no double target (except from C1, but let's not consider that).  Now you have fundamentally two options - either shoot yellow at red which will give a good break opportunity if hit (and concede a good break opportunity to black if missed), or take a more defensive line by shooting yellow at blue from C3 into C4.  If yellow misses this shot, it does give black a 1-yard roquet at red for the innings, however it not only gives no break prospects, but also requires black to play several good strokes in order to have a good leave.  Black's take off from C2 to blue on the east boundary is a difficult shot, and if black doesn't succeed in roqueting blue in its next shot (either taking off short and missing blue, or taking off too far and sending black out) then yellow will have a 9-10 yard shot at blue & black from near C4.




              If black has joined a yard south of red near C2, the yellow has aggressive and defensive options available
            


Response to missed EB ball after Supershot opening
The response here depends a lot on both the length of the supershot ball and what option black chose on turn 3.  Firstly let's assume the most common scenario, with blue halfway between H5 and peg, and 1-2 yards west of the centre line, and red approximately peg high on the EB, and black in or near C4.  In this situation the best option is normally to shoot at red from A baulk, with a miss joining up around 1 yard north of it.  This leaves blue a 15-yarder at red & yellow but difficult break prospects for both players, whomever plays the next shot. 




              The common response after a third-turn miss by black at red to C4, is for yellow to shoot at red, joining if missing.  An aggressive line is to shoot at black.  A third option is yellow at blue, which is shorter and will win you the innings, but only gives good break prospects if red and black are near to each other
            


As the weaker player against a stronger player, a very aggressive line of play would be to shoot yellow from A baulk at black in C4 - this is very black and white, as a hit will give you a good chance for a 4-ball break and a miss will give black the same chance.  As the weaker player, you can strongly consider this option.  
Consider for a moment that black's third-turn shot missed red from A baulk, or perhaps missed red from west of C3, finishing 5-10 yards south of red.  In this case, yellow for look for possible double targets available from B baulk.  Consider, too, the shortest shot available, which is yellow at blue from A baulk - this is likely a 11-13 yard shot which, if hit, gives good break prospects to yellow because red and black are close together.
Response to ignored duffer tice
The vast majority of the time the best response to black ignoring red's duffer tice, is for yellow to shoot hard at red from B baulk.  Usually a duffer tice is only 9-10 yards and so it will be, by far, the shortest shot for yellow.




              The majority of the time, the fourth turn response would be to shoot yellow at the duffer.  Against a very strong player, you might be tempted by yellow at black in C4 which, although 3 yards longer, gives an easy start to your break
            


An expection to this would be if blue & black are joined on the east boundary leaving a good double target from A baulk, and so you may want to consider shooting at that instead.  Another option to consider is if black shot and missed blue from C3 to C4.  If you are playing against a much stronger opponent you may consider shooting yellow at black from A baulk into C4.  This shot is 3 yards longer than yellow at red from B baulk, but hitting this shot gives you vastly stronger break prospects than if you hit red first.
Response to missed duffer tice
If black misses the duffer tice (red) gently, the logical response is to shoot hard at either red from B baulk or black from A baulk (whichever is closer).  If black misses the duffer tice from C3 across to the west boundary, you may consider shooting at black from C1 through to C2, particularly if black is south of peg-high.  




              If the duffer tice is still in its original position at the start of turn 4, the general response is for yellow to shoot at red given its proximity to B baulk.  If black missed red from C3 however, it can be tempting to shoot at black from C1 on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C4 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, red a few inches north of C4 and black 1 yard north of blue, yellow's default response should be to shoot at red from A baulk.  Hitting this shot gives a great break opportunity, as it is a very natural stroke to croquet red to H2 while approaching blue & black up the east boundary.  
Response to 3 balls on EB
In this instance, you simply need to hit one of the balls on the east boundary - from either A baulk or B baulk, depending on length and available targets.
Response to 3 balls in-court
A supershot opening with lags by red and black essentially forces yellow to shoot at the closest ball.  A very black and white opening, good break prospects for both players on turn 4 or 5, depending on whether yellow hits or misses.  Often times, black will have take a gentle lag while attempting a roquet at either blue or red on turn 3, so this may also give yellow some target to shoot at on turn 4.

Conclusion
If you have gotten to the bottom of this article, you have probably realised by now that the number of opening options are vast.  This article could not hope to cover every eventuality, and nor does it present any new or unseen openings; rather it serves to talk through the options and thought processes for choosing a particular option, and I hope it has been useful.

Openings

        The opening is the battle between the two sides to be the first to gain
        the upper hand. Generally when we talk about openings in croquet, we are
        referring to the first 4 turns. At the very top level it is where games
        are won and lost, but at all levels it provides a fascinating array of
        options for bluffing and double-bluffing your opponent.
      
Opening priorities
As the stronger player

        The stronger player who is playing a dangerous but less experienced /
        weaker player will generally approach the opening with the intent of not
        giving away an easy break, and hence a more defensive mindset. Openings
        where there is a lot of grey area, balls on boundaries and in corners
        are best for this. The stronger player will generally rely on their
        better all-round game in order to win, and is more comfortable with
        digging balls out slowly into a break.
      
As the weaker player

        The weaker player should approach a game against a much stronger
        opponent with an attacking mindset - they will not be afraid to take on
        relatively short shots that give laid breaks, even if it means conceding
        a laid break if they miss. The weaker player should favour openings that
        have balls in-lawn and should be looking to put pressure on the stronger
        player to have to hit in.
      
Evenly-matched players

        It is quite common to see very aggressive, black and white, openings
        when two very strong players play against each other. The same is true
        for openings between evenly-matched players at lower levels, but
        generally to a lesser extent. A lot of the opening strategy depends on
        the individual mindset of the player, with some players naturally
        playing a more attacking game than others.
      

        Below are articles on various well-known (and some not-so-well-known)
        openings, which discuss options for placement of balls, and responses to
        them. For the purposes of simplicity, in the examples below, the balls
        will always be played in the following order:
      


 Blue
        

 Red
        


          Black
        


          Yellow
        


Note: there is no ball order or sequence in which the balls need to
          be added to the game in croquet - the above order is simply to keep
          things consistent for the diagrams and explanations.


        As you can probably imagine, the options in the opening are endless.
        This article attempts to talk through some of the most common options,
        and some of the most common responses to them, with the idea of
        clarifying some of the thought processes behind them.
      

The Dream Leave

        Many of the openings below will reference something known as the Dream
        Leave - this is a scenario where the third turn ball (black) has hit and
        arranged the court as follows:
      




            Black hit on turn 3 and set a dream leave
          



        Black has retrieved red from wherever it was on the court and placed it
        slightly in-lawn from the west boundary, north of peg-high, and left
        blue a rush to it from the east boundary. This leave gives no short shot
        for yellow, and any miss by yellow will give blue a good break
        opportunity.

 First
        Ball Options
      

East Boundary

          The most common option selected by the first ball player. A ball to
          the east boundary, somewhere between level with H4 and H5, is chosen
          due to its relative distance from both baulk lines and from H1. It is
          a completely non-threatening ball and allows the second ball player to
          dictate the nature of the game, be it defensive or aggressive.
        
In-lawn East Boundary ball

          A variation on the standard east boundary ball, the in-lawn east
          boundary ball is struck out in the same area as the standard east
          boundary ball, but purposefully left about 1 yard in from the yardline
          area. The idea behind that is so that black can play its third turn
          shot out behind blue and leave itself a rush in-court. This play
          discourages responses like a west boundary tice from red.
        
Supershot

          A supershot ball is a first-turn ball placed near the middle of the
          court, normally between H5 and peg and a couple of yards west of the
          centre line. This is the most aggressive sensible option for the first
          ball, and signals your intent to your opponent that you want no grey
          area. Given its proximity to H1, a supershot ball generally gives a
          good chance for a break for either player, depending on whether the
          third-turn, fourth-turn or fifth-turn shots are hit.
        

          There are variations on the length of the supershot, with a supershot
          played to near the peg being a poorer pioneer for H1 but having the
          advantage of lengthening any fourth-turn shot by yellow at it.
        
Anti-duffer

          This opening is an attempt to try and pre-empt the second-turn
          response and discourage a "duffer tice" by red. To lay an anti-duffer,
          you hit blue to a spot somewhere between H6 and the peg, and 1-2 yards
          west of the east boundary. The idea of placing a ball here is that if
          the opponent were to lay a duffer tice with red,
          then it gives black a good chance to hit red and take off behind blue
          for a rush to H1 on turn 3. It is a leave that is generally only used
          by strong players who have a realistic chance of a third-turn break in
          the first place.
        




              Some common first-ball scenarios
            


Unusual first-turn options

          The croquet court is a big place and so there really are endless
          options for where to place balls in the opening. Often an unusual
          option first-turn will yield good results by confusing the opponent!
        
C4 first ball

          Not often seen these days due to a preference for an east boundary
          ball 10 yards further north. A weakness of this opening is that
          shooting at partner on turn 3 and missing is liable to leave a double
          target for yellow. It also generally encourages yellow to take an
          aggressive shot on turn 4; however on a difficult lawn this opening
          can have some advantages, with any hit by yellow on turn 4 at balls in
          C4 leaving little room to promote balls into the court due to the
          close proximity to the corner.
        
C2 first ball

          Playing blue into C2 first turn can often catch the opponent off
          guard. This opening attempts to flip the tables on red and yellow by
          trying to ensure a defensive opening for blue and black. This can be a
          good option where blue and black are the stronger players and want to
          prevent aggressive second-turn options by red and yellow. Of course,
          there are options available to red and yellow which negate blue and
          black's defensive preferences.
        
Micro tice

          As unusual options go, this is right up there. This option would not
          be recommended when playing a strong player, but nevertheless is very
          interesting. The micro tice is a ball played from the end of A baulk
          towards the east boundary, but only 2-3 yards towards it, leaving a
          2-3 yard roquet for the opponent on the second turn. This length of
          shot cannot really be refused, but leaving red a croquet stroke from
          south-west of hoop 4 on the second turn of the game gives no real
          break prospects. Often the second turn player will attempt an approach
          to H1 and fail it, leaving a 6-yard roquet with two balls near H1 for
          black. This opening relies more on a tactical mistake from red than
          anything else
        
C1 / C3 opening

          Occasionally seen. Not a good opening against any experienced
          opponent, but occasionally yields results. This first-turn option is
          not to be recommended. A first-turn ball in C1 followed by a
          second-turn response to C3 (or vice versa) is a killer blow to black's
          turn.

 Second
        Ball Options
      


          This is where things start to get a little interesting. For the most
          part, the opening is dictated by the second ball response, and there
          are many more options available.
        
Response to East Boundary ball
Standard Tice

          The standard tice is one of the most popular responses to an east
          boundary ball at club-level croquet. Although in recent years it has
          fallen out of favour with top players (likely due to an increase in
          the standard of shooting), it is still a great opening that gives good
          chances to both sides.
        

          The standard tice is where red is played to the west boundary, and the
          distance it is placed north of C1 needs to be carefully considered by
          the striker or red. The name "tice" indicates that the distance should
          be enticing for the player of black to shoot at and so a distance of
          between about 8 and 13 yards is common. As a general rule, if possible
          the distance chosen should either be about 1 yard longer than the
          opponent's critical distance (the distance at which someone hits 50%
          of their shots) or 1 yard shorter (or equal to) your own critical
          distance. Obviously this cannot be achieved if your opponent has a
          longer critical distance than you do, so it is better to err slightly
          on the longer side.
        

          If blue is an in-lawn east boundary ball, laying a standard tice is
          risky, as black can quite easily lay a rush directly to it on the
          third turn.
        
C2 ball

          Probably the most common response to the east boundary ball today is
          the second-turn ball to 6" south of C2. The reason for playing just
          south of C2 is that if in the unlikely event of black shooting at red
          on turn 3, a miss will likely leave yellow a double target. The idea
          of red near C2 means that red is buried in a defensive position, and
          signals yellow's intent to shoot at blue and black on turn 4.
        

          If blue is slightly in-lawn, then C2 is the safest and most defensive
          response with red.
        
Duffer tice

          One of the more aggressive responses for red is the duffer tice. This
          is a ball that is placed usually about 2-feet north and a few inches
          east of penultimate. This is similarly enticing for the opponent to
          shoot (just as with a standard tice) but in this case a miss is
          usually more critical - any third turn shot at the duffer is in the
          direction of A baulk so black usually takes the shot gently - and by
          doing so is more likely to miss. Black missing leaves two balls in the
          centre of the court, giving yellow a great chance on turn 4. The
          duffer tice is a great option for weaker players playing against
          stronger players, and also for anyone confident in hitting 10 yarders.
        

          Between two very strong players a duffer tice is still a popular
          opening. There are variations on the placement of the ball near
          penult, based on the strength of the opponent. It is common to see a
          duffer tice placed level with, or south of, H6, particularly if the
          striker of red and yellow is a very good shot and is confident to hit
          an 11-yarder on turn 4. In a game between experts, the placement of
          red is sometimes moved to the west of H6 to discourage a third-turn
          break after a hit from black at blue.
        
C4 ball

          This option is very popular in New Zealand and although a mirror image
          of the C2 ball, is a lot more aggressive. Placing red 6" north of C4
          not only gives negligible break prospects to black on turn 3 but also
          signals your intent to hit fourth-turn with yellow and have a break. A
          miss at partner by black on turn 3 gives you a 13-yard shot for a
          4-ball break, and a miss by black at red on turn 3 usually gives a
          double target.
        
Shoot at first-turn ball

          A slightly counter-intuitive option but nonetheless an interesting
          one. Shooting red at blue on turn 2 and hitting gives no break
          prospects, but a miss also leaves very slim break prospects for black
          on turn 3 if it hits, unless black is a very strong player. With this
          opening it is quite common to see misses on both turns 2 and 3, and
          often a triple target for yellow at the other 3 balls on turn 4 from B
          baulk.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to east boundary opening
            


Response to Supershot ball

          The supershot ball is the most aggressive opening that the first-turn
          player can use. There are several responses to this which need to be
          considered, based on your assessment of your opponent's ability and
          whether the opponent has realistic prospects of a break to 4-back if
          they do manage to hit 3rd turn.
        
C2 response

          The C2 response is a ball played about 6" south of C2. This is a
          strong response to a supershot against almost all players. If the
          player of black wants to attempt a third-turn break, they will have to
          hit a 13-yarder and play a very difficult croquet stroke out of C2 to
          get a rush to H1, and this is by no means guaranteed. On the other
          hand, a miss by black at red on turn 3 will leave yellow a double
          target and a 4-ball break if hit.
        




              It is important to finish a few inches south of C2 with red as it
              will mean black missing on either side of it will leave a double
              target. Above is a comparison of yellow's target after a
              third-turn miss by black at red, firstly with red in C2 and
              secondly with red a few inches south of C2
            



          There are only a handful of players in the world where the C2 ball is
          not a great response - players who would expect to hit the 13 yarder
          most of the time and also be good enough at croquet strokes to expect
          to get a rush to H1 on the supershot ball. Against these players the
          strategy of lengthing the 3rd turn shot would be preferred.
        
C4 response

          Mirror image to the C2 response, this ball is played 6" north of C4.
          Consider this if blue (the supershot ball) is placed further north
          than normal (somewhere near peg-high), or is in a particular spot
          which may have H4 obscuring any croquet stroke from C4 towards it. It
          otherwise gives all the same advantages as the C2 response
        
Max Distance response

          As a counter to the very top players hitting the ball in C2 most of
          the time, the max distance response became popular - this is where red
          is played to the east boundary about level with the peg on the east
          boundary, leaving the longest shot possible for black. This response
          grants black a shot from C3 through red and into C4, reducing yellow's
          fourth-turn prospects - it relies more on black missing red than
          trying to make any break pick-up by black more difficult. Generally a
          good option against the very best players, but against most players is
          unnecessary.  
The reason why max distance on the east boundary is chosen instead of the equivalent max distance spot on the west boundary is that it is slightly further from the supershot ball (blue), which is slightly south-west of the peg.  Assuming that the shots on turns 3 and 4 are missed, blue's shot at red & yellow on the east boundary will be a couple of yards longer than the equivalent shot to the west boundary.  
Supershot lag

          The response for red to lag to a spot 3-4 yards east and 1-2 yards
          north of the supershot ball is a very strong and very under-used
          response to the supershot. This is a good tactic when playing someone
          who is a very good shot, and in particular if the supershot ball
          itself is quite deep (nearer the peg than H5). Placing red beside blue
          nullifies the strength of black's shooting by encouraging black to
          take its third turn shot gently (which is generally less accurate), or
          risk shooting hard and missing into B baulk, conceding a 4-ball break.
          In this case, black may choose not to shoot at all, and instead also
          lag to a position wide of the other two balls, meaning that red and
          yellow have successfully turned the tables of the supershot opening
          and enabled yellow to have the first attempted roquet.
        




              Some common second-ball responses to supershot opening
            


Roquet the Supershot ball

          The ultimate way to nullify the supershot ball - roquet it on the
          second turn. After roqueting blue with red, there are several options
          available. You can croquet blue towards C2 and then fire red off 6"
          north of C4. A more aggressive option would be to croquet blue
          north-west of H2 and fire red off the south boundary, south of H4 -
          this leaves black a choice of 7-8 yarders but minimal break prospects
          and difficult strokes with their third turn in order to distance the
          balls from baulk. A more novel option would be to crosswire blue and
          red at the peg, which leaves only a 17-yard shot for black with a
          baulk line in the background. An even more interesting option might be
          to roll blue close to the peg, either east or west, and then play red
          a yard or two away from it, wiring blue's backswing at red. This means
          that black probably has no lag option towards blue that doesn't leave
          a double-target for yellow.
        
Response to unusual first-turn options
Response to a first-turn C2 ball

          A first-turn C2 ball is an attempt by blue to make red conform to a
          defensive opening. Red could of course do this if it wants, by playing
          6" north of C4, or even by just having a "standard" east boundary
          ball; however a better option to negate blue's attempt at dictating
          the opening might be to set a duffer tice - this is the ultimate
          aggressive response to the C2 ball, and means that black is suddenly
          faced with having to hit a 10-13 yarder on turn 3 or risk leaving the
          same for yellow next turn, and a laid break.
        
Back to top



 Third
        Ball Options
      

        For the vast majority of players, if they manage to hit in on the third
        turn of the game, they will and should be looking to make a dream leave
        (see top of page) or similar, possibly with red near the peg and blue &
        black with a rush towards it. There are exceptions to this line of play,
        mainly with supershot openings, but unless otherwise stated, the
        standard play would be to try and set a dream leave.
      

Response to WB tice after EB opening

          Realistically, black will not be attempting to make any break on turn
          3 if it manages to hit in. The player of black has to make a judgement
          call on their likelihood of hitting the standard tice vs their
          opponent's likelihood of missing it.
        


            If the tice is long, the best response is probably to shoot black at
            blue from A baulk. Missing black at blue leaves the free shot at the
            tice for yellow of course, which does give yellow fairly good
            prospects if hit. If the tice is extremely long, say peg-high, then
            black could quite feasibly just lag at blue and attempt to leave a
            rush to red. Bear in mind that playing this lag so early in the game
            may be difficult as you may not have the pace of the court - and
            there is a risk that lagging at blue and falling short will leave
            yellow a double target on turn 4.
          

            Another option if black is uncertain, would be to shoot at blue from
            C3, and missing through to C4. This hedges black's bets somewhat, as
            it is still taking a shot at a ball and still somewhat joining with
            partner ball, but does not give good break prospects to the opponent
            if yellow hits, due to the proximity of blue and black to one
            another. Yellow is faced with a long takeoff from red towards blue
            and black and in all likelihood will not get a rush to H1 from this
            position.
          

            The third option is of course to shoot at the tice itself. Hitting
            red will give the opportunity to make a dream leave (as shown at the
            top of the page). Missing red will send black towards C2, which will
            give black a free shot back through red and yellow if yellow misses
            its fourth-turn shot at red.
          





              Some common third-ball responses to a standard tice
            


Response to C2 ball after EB opening

          There are two common options after a second-turn C2 ball - both
          consist of shooting at partner. If partner is hit, then usually the
          play will be to take off to the red in C2, roquet it and then croquet
          it either into the centre of the court, or along the west boundary,
          then lag back to partner and leave a rush in-court. However, consider
          a game where you are the stronger player playing a very capable weaker
          player, if you do hit partner third turn, you can elect to just set a
          rush to the C2 ball instead of trying to retrieve it from C2. As the
          stronger player you may prefer this line of play, instead of digging
          out the C2 ball only for your opponent to hit on turn 4 and have an
          easy break.
        

          Usually the third-turn shot at partner with black will be from A
          baulk, joining up on the east boundary if missed. This leaves a long
          double target for yellow from the end of B baulk. A more defensive
          play would be to shoot at partner from C3 into C4. Doing this leaves
          almost no break prospects fourth-turn for yellow but, depending on the
          distance between blue and black, may give them the opportunity to join
          up.
        

          Another option for black on turn 3 would be to shoot at red in C2 -
          however usually this is only a viable option if red is exactly in the
          corner, as it will mean that missing red on the right leaves no double
          target for yellow. Alternatively, another option would be for black to
          join up with red near C2, about 3-4 feet south of it. Doing so leaves
          no double target from B baulk and gives good break prospects to black
          if yellow misses the 13 yarder, although it must be remembered that
          yellow also has good prospects if it hits the 13 yarder. Black joining
          up with red also leaves a defensive shot for yellow at blue from C3 to
          C4 which, if missed, leaves black a very long and tricky takeoff from
          C2 to the east boundary.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a C2 ball
            


Response to C2 / C4 ball after Supershot opening

          The third-turn response to this option depends greatly on your ability
          and also the ability of your opponent. Before you lay the supershot,
          you need to ask yourself "am I realistically good enough to play a
          third-turn break to 4-back?". If the answer is no, then that does not
          mean that the supershot opening is a bad idea at all, but it just
          means that you may want to reassess your third-turn response.
          Additionally, if you are playing someone that you believe is much
          better than you are, then trying to give yourself a 4-ball break on
          turn 5 is exactly what you should be trying to achieve. Therefore,
          instead of trying to roquet the 13 yard shot of black at red just
          south of C2 (or just north of C4), you can instead look to join up
          with the ball 3-4 feet away, ensuring to leave no double target. This
          puts a great deal of pressure on your stronger opponent to then hit a
          13 yarder or else concede a 4-ball break to you.
        

          If you believe you are good enough to hit on turn 3 and play a break,
          then the answer is simple - hit red near C2 and go round.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a supershot / C2 ball
            


Response to EB ball after Supershot opening

          In most cases, the third-turn response to a max distance ball is to
          try and hit it from C3, missing into C4. Again, however, you should
          evaluate your own likelihood of playing a break to 4-back with only 3
          balls on the lawn if you hit, and so you may want to consider lagging
          to the ball, a couple of yards in-lawn from the east boundary.
        

          If the ball on the east boundary is south of the peg, it is tempting
          to simply shoot at it from A baulk. Missing will of course leave a
          double from B baulk, but the odds of yellow then hitting a double
          target from 20+ yards is no certainty. Alternatively, if the
          second-turn ball is around peg-high, then shooting at it from B baulk
          from a few yards west of C3 and missing often results in a fairly even
          spread of the balls, with your black ball being approximately 8 yards
          south of red and 8 yards north of C4. This again is technically a
          double target from somewhere on B Baulk, but given the distance
          between red and black, is easily missed and will leave your black ball
          a shot of only 8 yards.

Response to C4 ball after EB opening

          This opening creates one of the more interesting third-turn decisions.
          A second-turn ball 6" north of C4 is a very threatening position and
          therefore the options will as follows:
        


            Shoot at partner
            
Hit - set a dream leave

                Miss - leaves yellow a 13-yard shot at red in C4 for a 4-ball
                break
              



            Shoot at opponent near C4 from A baulk
            

                Hit - set a dream leave (you may want to have a go at gaining a
                rush to H1 on partner)
              

                Miss - leave a 13-yard double for yellow (but slightly tricky
                break pick-up)
              



            Join up with opponent near C4, leaving no double
            

                If red is 3-6" north of C4 - join a yard north of it from A
                baulk
                
No short double target is left for yellow

                    Yellow still only has a 13-yard shot for the innings (but a
                    slightly tricky break pick-up)
                  



                If red is ~12" north of C4 - shoot from C3 through to C4
                

                    Enables black to have a shot (albeit very long) to attempt
                    to hit and set a dream leave
                  




Black to C2


              By burying itself in C2, this enables black to kill off the
              aggression by red and yellow. Any miss by yellow will leave a 9
              yarder (at most) for blue
            






              Some common third-ball responses to a C4 ball
            



          A personal preference of mine is to shoot third-turn at the ball near
          C4 from A baulk, because hitting gives me control of the court, and I
          miss often enough by more than several inches so as not to leave a
          double.
        

          Be on the lookout for cannons around C4 as part of this opening -
          there is often a good opportunity to bombard a live ball across to H1
          while playing a croquet stroke towards blue on the east boundary. This
          can make picking up the first break a great deal easier.
        
Response to duffer tice after EB opening

          The duffer tice is one of my favourite openings. Because of the
          placement of red near H6, a miss by black from the end of B baulk will
          be headed towards A baulk and give an easy start for yellow. That is
          why we see the ~9 yard shot at red refused so often, even by very
          strong players!
        

          If black does decide to shoot at the duffer and hits, then not a great
          deal of options are available other than to take off to partner ball
          (usually nudging red towards the peg in the process), and leave a rush
          towards red, and then hope for a fourth-turn miss by yellow.
        

          Another option for shooting at the duffer is doing so from C3,
          shooting across the court and missing to around peg-high (or just
          south of peg-high) on the west boundary. This is the most defensive
          shot available in that a miss gives no break to yellow if yellow hits
          red, but it also does not put any pressure on yellow's shot at red.
          Often times, when black misses the shot from C3 at red, it will end up
          south of peg-high on the west boundary and be a tempting free shot for
          yellow from C1.
        

          Shooting at partner ball on turn 3 is the most aggressive line of play
          - taking the shot from A baulk and hitting gives the opportunity to
          play a big croquet stroke loading partner to H2 and attempting to get
          a rush to H1 on the duffer ball - it is a big shot and the break
          chances are normally only reasonable for very strong players. Missing
          partner from A baulk on the other hand gives yellow a ~9 yard shot and
          very strong break prospects. It is therefore more usual to see black
          shoot at blue from C3 which, although longer, doesn't make all the
          balls available to yellow if black misses blue and yellow hits red. It
          also means that blue and black maintain a wide join and have realistic
          prospects of hitting back in if yellow misses red.
        




              Some common third-ball responses to a duffer tice
            


Response to 2 balls on EB

          If red has shot at blue on turn 2 and missed, leaving both balls on
          the east boundary, you should carefully evaluate your response based
          on the strength of your opponent. If you and your opponent are evenly
          matched but not world class players, or especially if your opponent is
          a much stronger player than you, then the best thing to do here may be
          to simply ignore the two balls on the east boundary and lag black into
          the middle of the court and wait for yellow to miss. This potentially
          presents you with an immediate break with a ball in the middle of the
          court.
        

          In a match between two very strong players it would be unusual to see
          no shot taken on turn 3, and if hit, some attempt at digging out a
          3-ball break.
        
Response to 2 balls in-court

          In a situation where you have laid a supershot with blue, and red has
          lagged a couple of yards north east of your supershot ball, if there
          is no double target to be had from anywhere on the baulk lines, you
          must again consider your expectations after hitting third turn vs your
          opponent's likelihood of hitting fourth turn. As with previous
          options, if you are playing an opponent who on paper is a much
          stronger player, the percentage play is usually to lag the black ball
          into the middle of the court beside the other two balls (being mindful
          not to leave a double target from anywhere), which will put pressure
          on your stronger opponent to hit in or else concede the first break
          opportunity to you.
        

          If you do want to shoot with black at one of the balls in the middle,
          then consider either shooting at the easterly ball from C1 (you may
          even be able to shoot hard at this without missing to B baulk), or
          alternatively shooting at a medium pace at either blue or red from the
          closest point on A baulk. If you do shoot from the closest point, be
          sure to hit at a pace to finish slightly south of H6, both so that
          black is not a short shot from B baulk, and so that any double target
          that you leave has plenty of space between the front and back ball.
        

          If you are facing a third turn shot with black after red has
          cross-wired blue and red at the peg, check first to see if there is a
          point which you can lag to where blue won't be wired from black, and
          which won't be giving a double target from either baulk line - if
          there is such a spot, then that is the best place to lag to.

 Fourth Ball Options
      

The fourth-turn response is usually actually more simple than then third-turn response - although there are more possible scenarios, they almost always result in yellow trying to roquet something.  
      

Response to ignored WB tice
When black has ignored a standard west boundary tice and insetad shot at (and missed) partner on the east boundary, the obvious response is to then try and hit red yourself from C1.  If the placement of red is good, you should have ~50% chance of hitting in.  Your break prospects after hitting red are actually quite good, as you will play a take off from red to blue & black, which will automatically be sending red towards H2 as a pioneer.  On the other hand, a miss with yellow through red into C2 only gives fairly mediocre break prospects to blue & black in the next turn.
Response to missed WB tice
If black did indeed shoot at red (and miss) from C1 in the previous turn, then the obvious response is to shoot at red yourself, but from a point east of C1 so that a miss will leave yellow joined with red.  If you hit red, your best line of play would be to roll red &  yellow towards C1 and lay a rush for your next turn.  A miss from red at yellow will of course leave black a shot through red and yellow from C2 to C1 but is likely to be a very long shot at a single ball target.  A miss from black on turn 5 here also gives you a good chance at establishing a break on turn 5.  




              If black has missed the standard tice, it leaves a good opportunity to join up with red on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C2 ball after EB opening
Having played red into C2 on turn 2, if black ignores red and simply joins with blue (which is likely), then against most players your best line of play would be to shoot at blue and black with red.  Whether you shoot from A baulk or B baulk depends on factors such as the distance between blue and black (whether it is easy to make a double target from B baulk or A baulk) and the flatness of the east boundary.  If the black ball missed blue badly on the left on turn 3, blue and black may well be 2+ yards apart on the east boundary, so there is a defensive option available to yellow as well - shoot from C3 through to C4, where a miss would not give blue & black any easy opening.
If you are the weaker player against a very strong opponent, then there is a case for shooting yellow at red - at 13 yards, it is significantly shorter than any other available shot and is therefore your best chance at winning the opening.  Red missing yellow gives blue a relatively easy start and a probable break, but against a very strong opponent it can still be worth the risk.  




              Fourth-turn responses for yellow when partner is in C2 and opponent balls are on the east boundary.  
            


Response to joined / missed C2 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, if black has for some reason shot at red in C2, then assuming a double target has been left, your best aggressive option is to shoot at this, preferably hitting the northern ball, from B baulk.  A hit or a miss here will give fairly good break prospects to whomever plays the next shot, given C2's proximity to H2 - a semi-good pioneer can usually be sent to H2 while obtaining a rush to H1.
If black has instead joined up a yard south of red on turn 2, you have no double target (except from C1, but let's not consider that).  Now you have fundamentally two options - either shoot yellow at red which will give a good break opportunity if hit (and concede a good break opportunity to black if missed), or take a more defensive line by shooting yellow at blue from C3 into C4.  If yellow misses this shot, it does give black a 1-yard roquet at red for the innings, however it not only gives no break prospects, but also requires black to play several good strokes in order to have a good leave.  Black's take off from C2 to blue on the east boundary is a difficult shot, and if black doesn't succeed in roqueting blue in its next shot (either taking off short and missing blue, or taking off too far and sending black out) then yellow will have a 9-10 yard shot at blue & black from near C4.




              If black has joined a yard south of red near C2, the yellow has aggressive and defensive options available
            


Response to missed EB ball after Supershot opening
The response here depends a lot on both the length of the supershot ball and what option black chose on turn 3.  Firstly let's assume the most common scenario, with blue halfway between H5 and peg, and 1-2 yards west of the centre line, and red approximately peg high on the EB, and black in or near C4.  In this situation the best option is normally to shoot at red from A baulk, with a miss joining up around 1 yard north of it.  This leaves blue a 15-yarder at red & yellow but difficult break prospects for both players, whomever plays the next shot. 




              The common response after a third-turn miss by black at red to C4, is for yellow to shoot at red, joining if missing.  An aggressive line is to shoot at black.  A third option is yellow at blue, which is shorter and will win you the innings, but only gives good break prospects if red and black are near to each other
            


As the weaker player against a stronger player, a very aggressive line of play would be to shoot yellow from A baulk at black in C4 - this is very black and white, as a hit will give you a good chance for a 4-ball break and a miss will give black the same chance.  As the weaker player, you can strongly consider this option.  
Consider for a moment that black's third-turn shot missed red from A baulk, or perhaps missed red from west of C3, finishing 5-10 yards south of red.  In this case, yellow for look for possible double targets available from B baulk.  Consider, too, the shortest shot available, which is yellow at blue from A baulk - this is likely a 11-13 yard shot which, if hit, gives good break prospects to yellow because red and black are close together.
Response to ignored duffer tice
The vast majority of the time the best response to black ignoring red's duffer tice, is for yellow to shoot hard at red from B baulk.  Usually a duffer tice is only 9-10 yards and so it will be, by far, the shortest shot for yellow.




              The majority of the time, the fourth turn response would be to shoot yellow at the duffer.  Against a very strong player, you might be tempted by yellow at black in C4 which, although 3 yards longer, gives an easy start to your break
            


An expection to this would be if blue & black are joined on the east boundary leaving a good double target from A baulk, and so you may want to consider shooting at that instead.  Another option to consider is if black shot and missed blue from C3 to C4.  If you are playing against a much stronger opponent you may consider shooting yellow at black from A baulk into C4.  This shot is 3 yards longer than yellow at red from B baulk, but hitting this shot gives you vastly stronger break prospects than if you hit red first.
Response to missed duffer tice
If black misses the duffer tice (red) gently, the logical response is to shoot hard at either red from B baulk or black from A baulk (whichever is closer).  If black misses the duffer tice from C3 across to the west boundary, you may consider shooting at black from C1 through to C2, particularly if black is south of peg-high.  




              If the duffer tice is still in its original position at the start of turn 4, the general response is for yellow to shoot at red given its proximity to B baulk.  If black missed red from C3 however, it can be tempting to shoot at black from C1 on turn 4
            


Response to ignored C4 ball after EB opening
With blue on the east boundary, red a few inches north of C4 and black 1 yard north of blue, yellow's default response should be to shoot at red from A baulk.  Hitting this shot gives a great break opportunity, as it is a very natural stroke to croquet red to H2 while approaching blue & black up the east boundary.  
Response to 3 balls on EB
In this instance, you simply need to hit one of the balls on the east boundary - from either A baulk or B baulk, depending on length and available targets.
Response to 3 balls in-court
A supershot opening with lags by red and black essentially forces yellow to shoot at the closest ball.  A very black and white opening, good break prospects for both players on turn 4 or 5, depending on whether yellow hits or misses.  Often times, black will have take a gentle lag while attempting a roquet at either blue or red on turn 3, so this may also give yellow some target to shoot at on turn 4.

Conclusion
If you have gotten to the bottom of this article, you have probably realised by now that the number of opening options are vast.  This article could not hope to cover every eventuality, and nor does it present any new or unseen openings; rather it serves to talk through the options and thought processes for choosing a particular option, and I hope it has been useful.

Leaves


Leaves
A "leave" in croquet is the culmination of the process of arranging the balls at the end of your turn.  The idea is that you keep the "innings", which normally means laying the court in an adventageous way for your partner ball, and that the opponent balls will be far apart, or at least wired from each other, with no short shots available.
What makes a good leave?

Your two balls close together with a useful rush
No shot shorter than 13 yards for the opponent, and no double target

What makes a great leave?

Your next turn is easier if the opponent misses than their turn is if they hit
No shot shorter than 17 yards for the opponent
Leaving some grey area - options available for the opponent to take a longer, more defensive shot
Polarity - influencing the opponent to play one ball over another, due to where it is positioned

Golden rules for making leaves
When all four balls are on the lawn, there are really two golden rules to leave-making that you should try to adhere to at all times.  Firstly, you should ensure that the very final ball you roquet in your turn should be your partner ball - this helps to organise a good rush for starting your next turn.  Secondly, you should try and ensure to always make your final hoop of the turn off an opponent's ball.  These two points are somewhat interrelated in that if you make your final hoop off the opponent, you will be roqueting it first after making the hoop, leaving partner ball "live" to be roqueted in a few strokes' time.

Diagonal Spread
The diagonal spread leave, or DSL for short, is probably the most commonly-attempted leave in croquet.  The reasons for this are that it is relatively easy to make, it is relatively forgiving if it goes horribly wrong, and doesn't leave any short shots from any baulk line.  It is a fairly hoop-agnostic leave, meaning that it is generally pretty easy to pick up a break from a DSL after a miss by the opponent, regardless of the hoop you are for.  In the example below, a DSL has been made after a break to 4-back by blue, with partner ball (black) for hoop 1.

As discussed in the golden rules above, the opponent ball is sent to 3-back (the final hoop of the turn).  Interestingly a good way to help achieve this is to organise earlier in the break to send partner to 2-back as an early pioneer after hoop 5 - if you send partner to 2-back then the 3-back pioneer will naturally be one of the opponent balls.
Before making 3-back you should organise the other opponent ball near the peg, fairly close to where you want its final position to be, and organise your partner ball 1-2 yards east of it to act as the escape ball. After making 3-back and croqueting the reception ball out towards the west boundary, you should try and rush the opponent ball by the peg into a wired spot immediately - the closer you can get it to the wired spot using a rush, the easier your job will be to wire it with the croquet stroke. Once the ball at the peg has been placed in the wired spot, you rush your escape ball (partner) out to the east boundary and lay a rush into the court for your partner ball, with both balls being wired from the ball at the peg, and ideally also wired from the ball near the west boundary.
Reverse DSL
A reverse diagonal spread is made in exactly the same way, but just organising the balls in a mirror-image, as in the diagram below.  Actually this can be quite a useful leave after a break to the peg when your partner ball is on 2-back, 3-back or 4-back as it makes picking up a break from any of these hoops fairly straightforward - certainly easier than a normal DSL.



A reverse DSL


The "B" Spread
If the diagonal spread is the most commonly-attempted leave, the "B" spread is probably the most commonly-completed leave.  Basically a "B" spread is a diagonal spread that has gone wrong when it comes to the wiring of the opponent balls at the peg.  Because the peg is narrow, the margins for error are fairly small.
Taking a step back, it is important to identify one of the most crucial parts of setting a DSL, and where a DSL is liable to go wrong - running 3-back.  Because of the distance between 3-back and the peg, it is quite important to get a forward rush out of 3-back to ensure that you are playing the crucial croquet stroke to place one oppo ball near the west boundary while approaching the other, from fairly close range.  It is very easy to lose control of the striker's ball when sending it more than a few yards in a croquet stroke and so any inaccuracies with the croquet stroke after 3-back stroke will compound in the placement of the ball near the peg. All too often, players will fail to get a rush out of 3-back, play a croquet stroke that leaves them a 2-yard roquet on the ball near the peg, and then roquet it so far out of position that they are unable to reliably croquet it back to the wired spot at the peg - this is by far the most common cause of the "B" spread.  If the ball near the peg is left open on the other opponent ball near the west boundary it generally results in leaving a 10-yard shot for the opponent.  



The difference between a DSL and a "B" spread - the image on the left shows red and yellow wired; the image on the right shows yellow is fully open on red


If you have gotten into a position whereby the opponent balls are left open across the peg, then it is worth considering not laying a rush for your partner, but instead wide-joining near corner 4, or in some cases even splitting up your balls completely, with one on the east boundary and the other in or near corner 2.
Do keep in mind that, although the "B" spread is a bad leave, a 10-yard shot still requires hitting, and it is a shot that is missed surprisingly frequently, even by strong players.  This is the advantage of attempting a diagonal spread - if it does go badly wrong and balls are left open, the opponent will still not have any shorter shot than around 10 yards. 
Backing out of a DSL
If your DSL is headed towards being a "B" spread then you have options to back out of it.  After making 3-back and sending an opponent ball towards the west boundary, it is at this point that you need to make a decision to continue with the DSL and risk a "B" spread or to back out and set an OSL - which we will look at further down this article.

Easy to pick up a break from most hoops
Maximum length shot

Disadvantages

Not polarising - doesn't force a particular opponent ball to play

Old Standard Leave
The Old Standard Leave, or OSL, was popular in earlier times, particularly in the 1960s.  Traditionally, the standard first-break tactic was to play your break to 4-back, peeling your partner through hoop 1 after 2-back, then after making 3-back to set an OSL (or "standard leave", as they were referred to at that time).  These days, the tactic of peeling partner through hoop 1 after 2-back is almost entirely extinct, as it is generally considered unhelpful - but the OSL is still a strong leave in its own right, whether partner is for H1 or H2.  The leave is very simple to make and leaves a 13-yard shot for the opponent ball at your balls in C4 from A Baulk.  There is no defensive option shot for the opponent to consider and they will have a fairly simple break pickup if they hit.

New Standard Leave
A new leave became popular in the 1990s in favour of the OSL, and is somewhat originally named the "New Standard Leave".  This leave is still one of the most popular leaves done today at the end of a break to 4-back.

There are 2 popular methods of making this leave:

With partner at 2-back - make 1-back off an opponent ball and place it near the west boundary after the hoop, then rush the other opponent ball down the court, loading it to 3-back as a pioneer; make 2-back off partner ball and get a rush to 3-back where the other opponent ball is waiting
With opponent at 2-back - make 2-back and croquet the opponent towards the west boundary while gaining a rush on partner towards 3-back where the other opponent ball is waiting

The first method has the advantage of giving good control over the placement of the west boundary ball whereas the second method has the advantage of not requiring an easterly rush out of 2-back.  Whichever method you choose, it is imperative that the 3-back pioneer is the opponent ball, because after making 3-back, the reception ball will need to be left in a very specific spot a few inches north-east of the hoop.
Placement of ball at H4
The trickiest part of setting the NSL is getting the ball at H4 accurately placed - you need to place it close enough to H4 that the ball will not have a backswing to shoot at your two balls on the east boundary.  You must also ensure that none of the ball is visible from A Baulk - even if an edge is visible it is sometimes possible for the opponent to shoot from A Baulk at a pseudo-double target with the edge of the ball at H4 and one of your balls in the background on the east boundary.  Finally, the ball must not be positioned in such a way that it does not rush to H1
In order to place the ball in the best spot, it is quite important that the approach is played from close-by and slightly south-east of the hoop. The hoop approach should ideally place the opponent ball just north of the ideal wired spot so that the hoop can be run past the reception ball and then roquet it back onto the perfect wired line - see the animation below:



Tap on the image to play the animation.


In the animation above, the grey circle indicates the ideal wired spot for red and the diagonal lines show the area which is wired from A Baulk.  It is perfectly reasonable to try and place the opponent ball in the ideal spot with the hoop approach - doing so will mean that you don't need to roquet it at all after the hoop and can instead just roquet black, leaving red where it is; but beware that trying to place red ideally in the hoop approach and leaving it short will make correcting the wiring more difficult - any roquet on a short red will only be sending it further away from the ideal spot.
Polarity
Unlike the diagonal spread, there is a certain amount of polarity in a NSL, meaning that you can influence the opponent's decision of which ball to play (or at least gain an easier break if they miss with the ball that they want to play) based on whether you place their backward or forward ball at H4 after 3-back.  This is more of an important decision in a game between stronger players who are capable of TP'ing, and also particularly in doubles this can be a critical tactical choice - for example if one of the opponents is a much weaker shot than the other, you would probably want to influence them to take the lift.
If the opponent chooses to lift their ball from H4 and take the "long" lift and misses from C3 to C4, then it is quite difficult for you to dig that ball out of C4 and into your break until you are for H4 yourself; on the other hand if the opponent lifts their ball from the west boundary and shoots from C3 to C4, it gives you the opportunity to establish a 4-ball break before you've even made H1 - you can do this by roqueting partner with your first shot, taking off to the C4 ball and playing a drive from C4, sending a pioneer to H2 while gaining a rush to H1 on the ball near H4.
Now consider that the opponent's clips are on penult and peg for example - it is highly likely in this scenario that the opponent will play their penult ball regardless of the ball positions.  Bearing this in mind, if you place the opponent's penult ball near the west boundary and their peg ball at H4, any missed lift with the penult ball will give you a greater chance at a 4-ball break and a possible TP.
A counter argument on the above scenario may be this: if the opponent (peg and penult) is bound to play their penult ball regardless of the ball positions, placing their penult ball on the west boundary may influence them to take the shorter lift shot from A Baulk instead of the longer shot from B Baulk, as they may correctly decide that missing any shot with their penult ball will give you a 4-ball break before H1.  Consider, instead, that placing the balls the "wrong" way round (peg ball on west boundary; penult ball at H4) and you may find your opponent will ultimately decide to take a longer shot with the penult ball than they may otherwise have done.  There is a balance of probabilities to be made between your expectation of the opponent hitting the long shot vs the short shot, and your reduced chances of making a game-winning break if they miss a more defensive shot into C4.
NSL summary
Advantages

Polarity - can influence opponent to play one ball or the other

Disadvantages

More tricky to make than a DSL
Easy to leave a double target from A Baulk if the ball at H4 is not perfectly placed

MSL (Maugham Standard Leave)
This is a variation on the NSL and was popularised by David Maugham, a leading player in the UK.  Compared to the NSL, instead of leaving a ball floating near the west boundary, after running 1-back under control you will croquet one of the opponent balls onto the middle of the west upright of H2.  In this position it cannot be rushed to H1 but acts as a perfect pioneer for H2.  As the ball at H2 is not rushable to H1, the rush is left for your partner ball to H1.



A MSL after a break by blue


This leave is more difficult to make than a NSL as it requires very good control of your break, particularly around 1-back, but there is a strong case to be made for it.  Assuming all the other clips are for H1, if the opponent lifts the ball from H4 and hits one of your balls down the east boundary from C3, then they will need to get a rush to H1 immediately.  Unless they just managed to snick the lift shot, then they are probably going to be faced with a long and difficult croquet stroke in order to obtain the rush to H1 on your other ball.
Placement of the ball at H2 after 1-back
The exact placement of the opponent ball onto the wire of H2 after running 1-back is shown in the animation below - tap on it to play.



Tap on the image to play the animation.


Blue makes 1-back off yellow with red as the escape ball for the southwards rush; partner (black) is the pioneer at 2-back.  When placing the ball on the wire of H2 after 1-back, you should endeavour to arrange the balls so that the placement is done from close range and can be done with a straight, gentle stop shot; playing this shot with any amount of split will mean that both the pace and the line will be much harder to judge.  Because you want to place the ball using a small straight stop shot, you should give some thought to the placement of the escape ball so that you will automatically gain a rush down the court on it without having to do anything with the striker's ball. 
Another advantage is that if the opponent lifts the ball from H4 and misses the long lift, you will be making H1 off partner (which is always comforting) and will have a perfect H2 pioneer.  This will pretty much guarantee that you are approaching H2 from a matter of inches away, and you can even look to get a dolly rush out of H2 towards C4 to develop the C4 ball before you have made H3.  Additionally, if you are looking at TPs, then having made H1 off partner, it will naturally be sent to H3 / 4b as a pioneer and potential peeling opportunity.
MSL summary
Advantages

Polarity - can influence opponent to play one ball or the other
You start next break by making H1 off partner
Probably the best leave for developing a standard triple opportunity
Potentially difficult break pickup for the opponent

Disadvantages

More tricky to make than a NSL or DSL
Rush to H1 from east boundary is slightly more difficult and is unlikely to be a dolly rush

Bryant Leave
This leave is named after NZ player Greg Bryant, who first started performing it regularly in 1993.  It is really the ultimate in aggressive leaves and is very difficult to make.  One ball is placed in the NSL position at H4, and the other is placed ideally about 1cm directly north of H1, or alternatively against the inside of one of the uprights, on the northern side.  Placement of this ball is difficult to get right and it is very important that none of the ball is showing through H1 on the southern side where it may be easy to hit from A Baulk.  



A Bryant Leave by blue


If you are preparing to make a Bryant Leave, then you must have an opponent ball as your 2-back pioneer.  Having a very close pioneer is important here, and you may consider placing it at 2-back from close range after H5 - ideally the pioneer will be 12 inches or less from 2-back. You should also have the other opponent ball at 1-back as the pioneer, which will naturally be sent out afterwards as the 3-back pioneer
Placement of the opponent ball at H1
This is the crucial part of the Bryant leave.  After making 1-back and loading the opponent ball to 3-back, you need a good rush on the pivot ball towards 2-back.  The pivot should then be placed around 1 yard east and 1 foot north of 2-back as an escape ball before you make 2-back off the opponent ball.



Tap on the image to play the animation.


After 2-back, roquet the opponent reception ball back in front of 2-back as close as possible and then place it into the required position with a delicate stop shot.  After that, you can roquet your escape ball (partner) towards 3-back and make the hoop off the other opponent ball, setting it in the NSL position afterwards.
Bryant Leave summary
Advantages

Opponent has no defensive shot so any miss will give you all the balls immediately
Artificial polarity - the opponent will still be more inclined to lift the ball from H1 despite having no safe shots
If the ball placed at H4 is for H2, it can be very tough to pick up a break after hitting the lift
Looks really cool

Disadvantages

There is no grey area - opponent has no defensive shot so may as well take the shortest shot
Difficult to make

Defensive Spread
A very good, and probably under-used, leave.  This leave is great if you are the stronger player playing against a weaker player.  While it only leaves a 13-yard lift shot, it gives very poor break prospects if the lift is hit.

The leave above is one variation of the defensive spread - a mirror image of the same leave can also be made, with blue/black laid up in C4 and one opponent ball near C2 and the other peg-high on the east boundary.
The variation where blue and black are laid up in C2 is an incredibly strong leave when red is for H3 (either by breaking down or by POPs during blue's break) and yellow is for 4-back - if red hits any lift shot whatsoever, its break  prospects are slim at best; on the other hand, a miss by red gives black strong prospects of starting a second break.  Even a more defensive miss of yellow at black gives fairly good break prospects for black.
This leave is perhaps at its best on a difficult lawn where picking up breaks is more challenging, and so you do not want to gift the opponent a break with balls in the middle of the court if they happen to hit your lift.  
Defensive Spread summary
Advantages

Very strong - if the clips are right
Gives very slim break prospects to your opponent if they hit the lift
Polarity - the opponent has aggressive and defensive lift shot options

Disadvantages

13-yard lift shot is conceded
Requires several accurate rushes to get exactly right

Vertical Spread
The vertical spread is generally thought of as a second-break leave, meaning that you would look to make this leave at the end of a break to the peg, normally when your partner has well advanced clips.  It is quite common to see players make this leave when their partner ball is for 4-back, however I would not advise doing so - it can be very difficult to finish from 4-back and peg after a miss by the opponent, and there are generally better leave options available for these clips.

Close





The Vertical Spread is actually quite easy to make, because the opponent balls can be placed from close range after running penult and rover without having to play any difficult shots.  The exact placement of the two balls at penult and rover is also not as crucial as it is when placing a ball on the back of H1 for example, because penult and rover are further from baulk.  Still, you should aim to achieve ideal position of the two opponent balls as it will give greater flexibility when deciding where to lay your own balls up at the conclusion of the turn.  The ball at penult should be placed in the front of the jaws of H6 - it is also fine to be up against one wire or the other, so long as it is on the inside of the wire and not visible from baulk, and the ball should ideally not be showing through the hoop on the non-playing side of H6.  The position for the ball at rover is essentially the same, but mirrored.
The most obvious use case for this leave is when partner (black in this case) is for penult, as it will give you an easy finishing turn from any missed lift.  Please note the diagram above has the opponent balls laid up on the east boundary, but you can just as easily lay up on the west boundary, which may enable an easier rush to penult.
You can also think of this leave as a fairly defensive leave.  If the opponent already has an advanced clip, e.g. they are for 4-back and H1, then you should try and arrange their forward ball to be the ball left south of penult. Doing this will encourage them to lift their forward ball, however if they do decide to shoot and hit with their backward ball, their break pick-up will be very difficult indeed, because the ball left in penult cannot be rushed to either H1 or H2.
Vertical spread summary
Advantages

Relatively easy to make
Very strong break prospects for your partner ball (if the clips are right)
Very poor break prospects for the opponent ball (if the clips are right)

Disadvantages

Limited value if partner clip is not for penult (or H5)

Cross-Peg
You can think of the cross-peg leave a bit like a diagonal spread, but with the west boundary ball about 12 yards further in court than normal.  The way you go about making the cross-peg is the essentially the same as that of the DSL, but after making your final hoop of the turn, you need to get a good rush to the peg where the other two balls are waiting.



A cross-peg after a break to the peg by blue


Because the rush out of your final hoop is so crucial to getting a good cross-peg, you would not frequently see this leave after a break to 4-back - making 3-back with control and a dolly rush to the peg is relatively difficult for relatively little gain in having a cross-peg instead of a DSL.  It is much more common to set this leave after running rover when your partner is for 4-back or penult.  Running rover and obtaining a dolly rush to the peg is significantly easier than the same out of 3-back, and what's more, rover is significantly closer to the peg than 3-back is.  The benefit of a cross-peg over a DSL is also more evident when for 4-back, because at the start of your next turn you will avoid the slightly tricky cross-court rushes from the east boundary to the west boundary, and also from there to 4-back.  



Tap on the image to play the animation.


The crucial thing to remember when setting the cross-peg leave (aside from the actual wiring itself) is that you should make sure the two opponent balls are placed slightly off horizontal to each other; the westerly ball should be just north of the peg and the easterly ball just south of the peg.  If this is not achieved, then it is likely that the opponent will have a 13-yard shot from somewhere on the court.
Cross-peg summary
Advantages

Easy to finish from 4-back and peg after a missed lift

Disadvantages

Wiring at close range at the peg can easily go wrong
No polarity
Easy break pick-up if lift is hit

Cross-Wire
A cross-wiring leave is where you leave both opponent balls close together at a hoop, wired from each other.  Cross-wiring can be done at any hoop, although it is not considered a lift leave - you should only plan to cross-wire if you have not made a lift hoop during your turn, otherwise the opponent will probably have a very short shot from one of the baulk lines.



Red and yellow are cross-wired at black's hoop


There is a sequence you should try to follow when making most cross-wires, which is:

Before making your final hoop, arrange one opponent ball and partner ball at the intended cross-wiring hoop
Make your final hoop off the opponent ball and gain a rush towards the cross-wiring hoop
Wire the two opponent balls at the hoop
Rush the escape ball (partner) away to a far corner

Cross-wiring opportunities
Cross-wiring is not a lift leave, so unless you are planning on laying for sextuples, most of the opportunities to do so tend to arise more by chance.  For example, if your clips are for penult and 3-back, and you hit in with your ball for penult, you can safely make your last two hoops without conceding a lift. In the example below, blue is for penult, black for 3-back; yellow has just broken down at H6 on a break.  Click the solution button below the image to see how blue might go about playing its next turn.

As you can see, the cross-wire is an incredibly strong leave and you should always be on the lookout for opportunities to make it - it will give a very long shot to your opponent, and an easy break if they miss, putting you in a very strong game position.
The (delayed) sextuple leave (or "1-back leave")
The main reasoning for playing for sextuples at all is to avoid the conceding of a lift, and so it is here where we can take advantage of cross-wiring as a standard part of a leave.  Below is a common leave seen when laying for a sextuple, leaving red and yellow the longest possible shot on the court:

To set this leave, you follow the same pattern outlined further above.  Before making hoop 6 (the final hoop of your turn), you should arrange one opponent and partner ball at hoop 1 (the cross-wiring hoop).  Make H6 with a rush back to H1 and cross-wire the opponent balls across the hoop, preferably diagonally, and gain a rush on partner ball towards C3.
The standard sextuple leave
Despite the name, this sextuple leave is rarely seen, both because it is much harder to get right, and also leaves a significantly shorter shot for the opponent.  The benefits of this leave as far as the sextuple goes is that it makes the sextuple turn a great deal easier, essentially nothing more than a quadruple peel. The standard sextuple leave is as follows:

                Click on the court to play the animation.  The action starts with blue running H4.



Close





As you can see, when setting this leave, you actually complete the cross-wiring after H5, then rush partner to H6 to score that hoop, afterwards gaining a rush to 1-back.  The reason this method is favoured for this particular leave is so that you can be rushing to 1-back from close range (near H6) instead of from near 2-back as you would have to do when performing the cross-wire after H6. Rushing to 1-back from close range helps you to obtain a good position for the jawsing of your ball in 1-back.
Polarity in cross-wiring leaves
In reality, leaving both opponent balls together (albeit wired from each other) means that there is little-to-no polarity to be had; however, there are some things you can do to still encourage one ball to play over the other.  Imagine that blue has cross-wired red and yellow at H1  (black's hoop).  Red is for 4-back and yellow is for peg, and as such, the striker of blue and black would want to  encourage yellow to play by substantially lengthening red's shot - the following leave is able to achieve this:



A 1-back leave with a degree of polarity - red is the opponent's backward ball so its shot at blue/black has been lengthened


Red is placed very near the south boundary as a deliberately poor pioneer at H1, and the length of red's shot is increased by 5-6 yards over what it would be in a normal cross-wire.  Placing red as a deliberately poor pioneer at H1 may encourage yellow to play.  Be aware, of course, that placing balls deliberately close to the boundary should only be done if you are confident of picking up a break from those positions afterwards, particularly bearing in mind that yellow may choose to corner.
Cross-wiring summary
Advantages

Ultimate distance between the opponent's balls and yours - normally 30+ yards
Gives you an easy break with a ball at your hoop if they miss

Disadvantages

No grey area - opponent is generally compelled to shoot
Not much polarity to be had
Opponent generally has an easy break if they hit (depending on clips)

Back to top

Third Turn Leaves
Generally when referring to a third-turn leave we are referring to when a player has hit on the third turn of the game and played a break to 4-back with 3 balls, then set a leave.  Bearing in mind that the fourth ball is not yet played into the game, the opponent does not have the option of which ball to play with their fourth-turn shot - they must play the remaining ball.  As such, there are opportunities to set a leave utilising the opponent's ball in close proximity to your own.
Three Ducks Leave
This leave is probably the most popular of all the third-turn leaves after a break to 4-back.



The standard Three Ducks leave after a break to 4-back by blue


The Three Ducks is so named because the balls are arranged like "ducks in a row", near the west boundary.  The best way to arrange this leave is to have your H1 ball near/on the west boundary, with the opponent ball about 1 yard further in-court and your 4-back ball another yard further in again - assuming an opponent miss, this then enables you to set an opponent ball as the H2 pioneer and take partner ball to H1 - which in turn will be sent to H3 / 4b for potential peeling opportunities later.
The Three Ducks is the most aggressive of the third-turn leaves and doesn't really leave any defensive option for the opponent.  Having said that, if the opponent takes the longer lift shot from C1 through to C2, it can be a bit tricky to dig the C2 ball out if you do not get a forward rush out of H1.  If no forward rush is achieved, you may choose to take off to C2 instead of croquet partner ball to H3.
Reverse Three Ducks Leave
A perfectly valid option, but far less frequently used.  This is a mirror image of the regular Three Ducks, although it is probably a bit more difficult to pick up a break from a missed lift.  It is easier to make than the regular Three Ducks as it doesn't require control out of 3b.



A reverse Three Ducks leave


If the opponent misses the shot from C3 to C4 there is an interesting opportunity to play a bombard on the in-lawn ball to H1 while approaching the ball in C4 - certainly it is not the kind of shot you would want to approach without having practised it, but if played successfully, gives an immediate 4-ball break.  
Third-Turn NSL
This leave is just like a regular NSL but obviously with a ball missing.  Again it's best to have your 4-back ball in the NSL position at H4, so the way you go about making this leave is slightly different than a normal NSL.



A third turn NSL by blue


After making 3-back you can rush partner out to the east boundary, then rush the opponent's ball back slightly south of 3-back.  A little stop shot is then played to send the opponent ball out towards partner while approaching the intended wired spot at H4 with striker's ball.
Another method would be to rush both partner and opponent out towards their east boundary positions, and then takeoff back to place your ball in the wired spot at H4. 
The fourth turn shot from the opponent is the exact equivalent of them lifting the ball from the west boundary and taking their lift shot.
Third-Turn Defensive Spread
The third-turn leave favoured by stronger players - this looks a lot like a DSL but with the peg ball missing.



A third-turn Defensive Spread by blue


After a fourth-turn miss from the opponent, the break pickup is similar to that of a DSL, but ideally the initial rush is left for the H1 ball on the opponent's ball, and your 4-back ball is placed on or near the west boundary. This gives the advantage of taking the rush to H1 with partner. 
When making this leave, very strong players will likely play their 4-back ball all the way to the west boundary with their final shot for blue, instead of lagging the ball a yard or two from the yardline - this adds more defence to the leave, and means that if the opponent does hit the long lift their break pick-up will be even more difficult.

Super Advanced Leaves

The Super Advanced game is a slightly modified version of association croquet that is played at championship level in England.  It incorporates an additional lift (at hoop 4) when compared to normal advanced rules, and hence changes the tactics and first-break leaves quite considerably.  As a result, all the golden rules for leave-making go out the window.  A separate article about super advanced first-break tactics and leaves is available here

Leaves
A "leave" in croquet is the culmination of the process of arranging the balls at the end of your turn.  The idea is that you keep the "innings", which normally means laying the court in an adventageous way for your partner ball, and that the opponent balls will be far apart, or at least wired from each other, with no short shots available.
What makes a good leave?

Your two balls close together with a useful rush
No shot shorter than 13 yards for the opponent, and no double target

What makes a great leave?

Your next turn is easier if the opponent misses than their turn is if they hit
No shot shorter than 17 yards for the opponent
Leaving some grey area - options available for the opponent to take a longer, more defensive shot
Polarity - influencing the opponent to play one ball over another, due to where it is positioned

Golden rules for making leaves
When all four balls are on the lawn, there are really two golden rules to leave-making that you should try to adhere to at all times.  Firstly, you should ensure that the very final ball you roquet in your turn should be your partner ball - this helps to organise a good rush for starting your next turn.  Secondly, you should try and ensure to always make your final hoop of the turn off an opponent's ball.  These two points are somewhat interrelated in that if you make your final hoop off the opponent, you will be roqueting it first after making the hoop, leaving partner ball "live" to be roqueted in a few strokes' time.

Diagonal Spread
The diagonal spread leave, or DSL for short, is probably the most commonly-attempted leave in croquet.  The reasons for this are that it is relatively easy to make, it is relatively forgiving if it goes horribly wrong, and doesn't leave any short shots from any baulk line.  It is a fairly hoop-agnostic leave, meaning that it is generally pretty easy to pick up a break from a DSL after a miss by the opponent, regardless of the hoop you are for.  In the example below, a DSL has been made after a break to 4-back by blue, with partner ball (black) for hoop 1.

As discussed in the golden rules above, the opponent ball is sent to 3-back (the final hoop of the turn).  Interestingly a good way to help achieve this is to organise earlier in the break to send partner to 2-back as an early pioneer after hoop 5 - if you send partner to 2-back then the 3-back pioneer will naturally be one of the opponent balls.
Before making 3-back you should organise the other opponent ball near the peg, fairly close to where you want its final position to be, and organise your partner ball 1-2 yards east of it to act as the escape ball. After making 3-back and croqueting the reception ball out towards the west boundary, you should try and rush the opponent ball by the peg into a wired spot immediately - the closer you can get it to the wired spot using a rush, the easier your job will be to wire it with the croquet stroke. Once the ball at the peg has been placed in the wired spot, you rush your escape ball (partner) out to the east boundary and lay a rush into the court for your partner ball, with both balls being wired from the ball at the peg, and ideally also wired from the ball near the west boundary.
Reverse DSL
A reverse diagonal spread is made in exactly the same way, but just organising the balls in a mirror-image, as in the diagram below.  Actually this can be quite a useful leave after a break to the peg when your partner ball is on 2-back, 3-back or 4-back as it makes picking up a break from any of these hoops fairly straightforward - certainly easier than a normal DSL.



A reverse DSL


The "B" Spread
If the diagonal spread is the most commonly-attempted leave, the "B" spread is probably the most commonly-completed leave.  Basically a "B" spread is a diagonal spread that has gone wrong when it comes to the wiring of the opponent balls at the peg.  Because the peg is narrow, the margins for error are fairly small.
Taking a step back, it is important to identify one of the most crucial parts of setting a DSL, and where a DSL is liable to go wrong - running 3-back.  Because of the distance between 3-back and the peg, it is quite important to get a forward rush out of 3-back to ensure that you are playing the crucial croquet stroke to place one oppo ball near the west boundary while approaching the other, from fairly close range.  It is very easy to lose control of the striker's ball when sending it more than a few yards in a croquet stroke and so any inaccuracies with the croquet stroke after 3-back stroke will compound in the placement of the ball near the peg. All too often, players will fail to get a rush out of 3-back, play a croquet stroke that leaves them a 2-yard roquet on the ball near the peg, and then roquet it so far out of position that they are unable to reliably croquet it back to the wired spot at the peg - this is by far the most common cause of the "B" spread.  If the ball near the peg is left open on the other opponent ball near the west boundary it generally results in leaving a 10-yard shot for the opponent.

If you have gotten into a position whereby the opponent balls are left open across the peg, then it is worth considering not laying a rush for your partner, but instead wide-joining near corner 4, or in some cases even splitting up your balls completely, with one on the east boundary and the other in or near corner 2.
Do keep in mind that, although the "B" spread is a bad leave, a 10-yard shot still requires hitting, and it is a shot that is missed surprisingly frequently, even by strong players.  This is the advantage of attempting a diagonal spread - if it does go badly wrong and balls are left open, the opponent will still not have any shorter shot than around 10 yards. 
Backing out of a DSL
If your DSL is headed towards being a "B" spread then you have options to back out of it.  After making 3-back and sending an opponent ball towards the west boundary, it is at this point that you need to make a decision to continue with the DSL and risk a "B" spread or to back out and set an OSL - which we will look at further down this article.

Old Standard Leave
The Old Standard Leave, or OSL, was popular in earlier times, particularly in the 1960s.  Traditionally, the standard first-break tactic was to play your break to 4-back, peeling your partner through hoop 1 after 2-back, then after making 3-back to set an OSL (or "standard leave", as they were referred to at that time).  These days, the tactic of peeling partner through hoop 1 after 2-back is almost entirely extinct, as it is generally considered unhelpful - but the OSL is still a strong leave in its own right, whether partner is for H1 or H2.  The leave is very simple to make and leaves a 13-yard shot for the opponent ball at your balls in C4 from A Baulk.  There is no defensive option shot for the opponent to consider and they will have a fairly simple break pickup if they hit.

New Standard Leave
A new leave became popular in the 1990s in favour of the OSL, and is somewhat originally named the "New Standard Leave".  This leave is still one of the most popular leaves done today at the end of a break to 4-back.

There are 2 popular methods of making this leave:

With partner at 2-back - make 1-back off an opponent ball and place it near the west boundary after the hoop, then rush the other opponent ball down the court, loading it to 3-back as a pioneer; make 2-back off partner ball and get a rush to 3-back where the other opponent ball is waiting
With opponent at 2-back - make 2-back and croquet the opponent towards the west boundary while gaining a rush on partner towards 3-back where the other opponent ball is waiting

The first method has the advantage of giving good control over the placement of the west boundary ball whereas the second method has the advantage of not requiring an easterly rush out of 2-back.  Whichever method you choose, it is imperative that the 3-back pioneer is the opponent ball, because after making 3-back, the reception ball will need to be left in a very specific spot a few inches north-east of the hoop.
Placement of ball at H4
The trickiest part of setting the NSL is getting the ball at H4 accurately placed - you need to place it close enough to H4 that the ball will not have a backswing to shoot at your two balls on the east boundary.  You must also ensure that none of the ball is visible from A Baulk - even if an edge is visible it is sometimes possible for the opponent to shoot from A Baulk at a pseudo-double target with the edge of the ball at H4 and one of your balls in the background on the east boundary.  Finally, the ball must not be positioned in such a way that it does not rush to H1
In order to place the ball in the best spot, it is quite important that the approach is played from close-by and slightly south-east of the hoop. The hoop approach should ideally place the opponent ball just north of the ideal wired spot so that the hoop can be run past the reception ball and then roquet it back onto the perfect wired line - see the animation below:



Tap on the image to play the animation.


In the animation above, the grey circle indicates the ideal wired spot for red and the diagonal lines show the area which is wired from A Baulk.  It is perfectly reasonable to try and place the opponent ball in the ideal spot with the hoop approach - doing so will mean that you don't need to roquet it at all after the hoop and can instead just roquet black, leaving red where it is; but beware that trying to place red ideally in the hoop approach and leaving it short will make correcting the wiring more difficult - any roquet on a short red will only be sending it further away from the ideal spot.
Polarity
Unlike the diagonal spread, there is a certain amount of polarity in a NSL, meaning that you can influence the opponent's decision of which ball to play (or at least gain an easier break if they miss with the ball that they want to play) based on whether you place their backward or forward ball at H4 after 3-back.  This is more of an important decision in a game between stronger players who are capable of TP'ing, and also particularly in doubles this can be a critical tactical choice - for example if one of the opponents is a much weaker shot than the other, you would probably want to influence them to take the lift.
If the opponent chooses to lift their ball from H4 and take the "long" lift and misses from C3 to C4, then it is quite difficult for you to dig that ball out of C4 and into your break until you are for H4 yourself; on the other hand if the opponent lifts their ball from the west boundary and shoots from C3 to C4, it gives you the opportunity to establish a 4-ball break before you've even made H1 - you can do this by roqueting partner with your first shot, taking off to the C4 ball and playing a drive from C4, sending a pioneer to H2 while gaining a rush to H1 on the ball near H4.
Now consider that the opponent's clips are on penult and peg for example - it is highly likely in this scenario that the opponent will play their penult ball regardless of the ball positions.  Bearing this in mind, if you place the opponent's penult ball near the west boundary and their peg ball at H4, any missed lift with the penult ball will give you a greater chance at a 4-ball break and a possible TP.
A counter argument on the above scenario may be this: if the opponent (peg and penult) is bound to play their penult ball regardless of the ball positions, placing their penult ball on the west boundary may influence them to take the shorter lift shot from A Baulk instead of the longer shot from B Baulk, as they may correctly decide that missing any shot with their penult ball will give you a 4-ball break before H1.  Consider, instead, that placing the balls the "wrong" way round (peg ball on west boundary; penult ball at H4) and you may find your opponent will ultimately decide to take a longer shot with the penult ball than they may otherwise have done.  There is a balance of probabilities to be made between your expectation of the opponent hitting the long shot vs the short shot, and your reduced chances of making a game-winning break if they miss a more defensive shot into C4.
NSL summary
Advantages

Polarity - can influence opponent to play one ball or the other

Disadvantages

More tricky to make than a DSL
Easy to leave a double target from A Baulk if the ball at H4 is not perfectly placed

MSL (Maugham Standard Leave)
This is a variation on the NSL and was popularised by David Maugham, a leading player in the UK.  Compared to the NSL, instead of leaving a ball floating near the west boundary, after running 1-back under control you will croquet one of the opponent balls onto the middle of the west upright of H2.  In this position it cannot be rushed to H1 but acts as a perfect pioneer for H2.  As the ball at H2 is not rushable to H1, the rush is left for your partner ball to H1.



A MSL after a break by blue


This leave is more difficult to make than a NSL as it requires very good control of your break, particularly around 1-back, but there is a strong case to be made for it.  Assuming all the other clips are for H1, if the opponent lifts the ball from H4 and hits one of your balls down the east boundary from C3, then they will need to get a rush to H1 immediately.  Unless they just managed to snick the lift shot, then they are probably going to be faced with a long and difficult croquet stroke in order to obtain the rush to H1 on your other ball.
Placement of the ball at H2 after 1-back
The exact placement of the opponent ball onto the wire of H2 after running 1-back is shown in the animation below - tap on it to play.



Tap on the image to play the animation.


Blue makes 1-back off yellow with red as the escape ball for the southwards rush; partner (black) is the pioneer at 2-back.  When placing the ball on the wire of H2 after 1-back, you should endeavour to arrange the balls so that the placement is done from close range and can be done with a straight, gentle stop shot; playing this shot with any amount of split will mean that both the pace and the line will be much harder to judge.  Because you want to place the ball using a small straight stop shot, you should give some thought to the placement of the escape ball so that you will automatically gain a rush down the court on it without having to do anything with the striker's ball. 
Another advantage is that if the opponent lifts the ball from H4 and misses the long lift, you will be making H1 off partner (which is always comforting) and will have a perfect H2 pioneer.  This will pretty much guarantee that you are approaching H2 from a matter of inches away, and you can even look to get a dolly rush out of H2 towards C4 to develop the C4 ball before you have made H3.  Additionally, if you are looking at TPs, then having made H1 off partner, it will naturally be sent to H3 / 4b as a pioneer and potential peeling opportunity.
MSL summary
Advantages

Polarity - can influence opponent to play one ball or the other
You start next break by making H1 off partner
Probably the best leave for developing a standard triple opportunity
Potentially difficult break pickup for the opponent

Disadvantages

More tricky to make than a NSL or DSL
Rush to H1 from east boundary is slightly more difficult and is unlikely to be a dolly rush

Bryant Leave
This leave is named after NZ player Greg Bryant, who first started performing it regularly in 1993.  It is really the ultimate in aggressive leaves and is very difficult to make.  One ball is placed in the NSL position at H4, and the other is placed ideally about 1cm directly north of H1, or alternatively against the inside of one of the uprights, on the northern side.  Placement of this ball is difficult to get right and it is very important that none of the ball is showing through H1 on the southern side where it may be easy to hit from A Baulk.  



A Bryant Leave by blue


If you are preparing to make a Bryant Leave, then you must have an opponent ball as your 2-back pioneer.  Having a very close pioneer is important here, and you may consider placing it at 2-back from close range after H5 - ideally the pioneer will be 12 inches or less from 2-back. You should also have the other opponent ball at 1-back as the pioneer, which will naturally be sent out afterwards as the 3-back pioneer
Placement of the opponent ball at H1
This is the crucial part of the Bryant leave.  After making 1-back and loading the opponent ball to 3-back, you need a good rush on the pivot ball towards 2-back.  The pivot should then be placed around 1 yard east and 1 foot north of 2-back as an escape ball before you make 2-back off the opponent ball.



Tap on the image to play the animation.


After 2-back, roquet the opponent reception ball back in front of 2-back as close as possible and then place it into the required position with a delicate stop shot.  After that, you can roquet your escape ball (partner) towards 3-back and make the hoop off the other opponent ball, setting it in the NSL position afterwards.
Bryant Leave summary
Advantages

Opponent has no defensive shot so any miss will give you all the balls immediately
Artificial polarity - the opponent will still be more inclined to lift the ball from H1 despite having no safe shots
If the ball placed at H4 is for H2, it can be very tough to pick up a break after hitting the lift
Looks really cool

Disadvantages

There is no grey area - opponent has no defensive shot so may as well take the shortest shot
Difficult to make

Defensive Spread
A very good, and probably under-used, leave.  This leave is great if you are the stronger player playing against a weaker player.  While it only leaves a 13-yard lift shot, it gives very poor break prospects if the lift is hit.

The leave above is one variation of the defensive spread - a mirror image of the same leave can also be made, with blue/black laid up in C4 and one opponent ball near C2 and the other peg-high on the east boundary.
The variation where blue and black are laid up in C2 is an incredibly strong leave when red is for H3 (either by breaking down or by POPs during blue's break) and yellow is for 4-back - if red hits any lift shot whatsoever, its break  prospects are slim at best; on the other hand, a miss by red gives black strong prospects of starting a second break.  Even a more defensive miss of yellow at black gives fairly good break prospects for black.
This leave is perhaps at its best on a difficult lawn where picking up breaks is more challenging, and so you do not want to gift the opponent a break with balls in the middle of the court if they happen to hit your lift.  
Defensive Spread summary
Advantages

Very strong - if the clips are right
Gives very slim break prospects to your opponent if they hit the lift
Polarity - the opponent has aggressive and defensive lift shot options

Disadvantages

13-yard lift shot is conceded
Requires several accurate rushes to get exactly right

Vertical Spread
The vertical spread is generally thought of as a second-break leave, meaning that you would look to make this leave at the end of a break to the peg, normally when your partner has well advanced clips.  It is quite common to see players make this leave when their partner ball is for 4-back, however I would not advise doing so - it can be very difficult to finish from 4-back and peg after a miss by the opponent, and there are generally better leave options available for these clips.

The Vertical Spread is actually quite easy to make, because the opponent balls can be placed from close range after running penult and rover without having to play any difficult shots.  The exact placement of the two balls at penult and rover is also not as crucial as it is when placing a ball on the back of H1 for example, because penult and rover are further from baulk.  Still, you should aim to achieve ideal position of the two opponent balls as it will give greater flexibility when deciding where to lay your own balls up at the conclusion of the turn.  The ball at penult should be placed in the front of the jaws of H6 - it is also fine to be up against one wire or the other, so long as it is on the inside of the wire and not visible from baulk, and the ball should ideally not be showing through the hoop on the non-playing side of H6.  The position for the ball at rover is essentially the same, but mirrored.
The most obvious use case for this leave is when partner (black in this case) is for penult, as it will give you an easy finishing turn from any missed lift.  Please note the diagram above has the opponent balls laid up on the east boundary, but you can just as easily lay up on the west boundary, which may enable an easier rush to penult.
You can also think of this leave as a fairly defensive leave.  If the opponent already has an advanced clip, e.g. they are for 4-back and H1, then you should try and arrange their forward ball to be the ball left south of penult. Doing this will encourage them to lift their forward ball, however if they do decide to shoot and hit with their backward ball, their break pick-up will be very difficult indeed, because the ball left in penult cannot be rushed to either H1 or H2.
Vertical spread summary
Advantages

Relatively easy to make
Very strong break prospects for your partner ball (if the clips are right)
Very poor break prospects for the opponent ball (if the clips are right)

Disadvantages

Limited value if partner clip is not for penult (or H5)

Cross-Peg
You can think of the cross-peg leave a bit like a diagonal spread, but with the west boundary ball about 12 yards further in court than normal.  The way you go about making the cross-peg is the essentially the same as that of the DSL, but after making your final hoop of the turn, you need to get a good rush to the peg where the other two balls are waiting.



A cross-peg after a break to the peg by blue


Because the rush out of your final hoop is so crucial to getting a good cross-peg, you would not frequently see this leave after a break to 4-back - making 3-back with control and a dolly rush to the peg is relatively difficult for relatively little gain in having a cross-peg instead of a DSL.  It is much more common to set this leave after running rover when your partner is for 4-back or penult.  Running rover and obtaining a dolly rush to the peg is significantly easier than the same out of 3-back, and what's more, rover is significantly closer to the peg than 3-back is.  The benefit of a cross-peg over a DSL is also more evident when for 4-back, because at the start of your next turn you will avoid the slightly tricky cross-court rushes from the east boundary to the west boundary, and also from there to 4-back.  



Tap on the image to play the animation.


The crucial thing to remember when setting the cross-peg leave (aside from the actual wiring itself) is that you should make sure the two opponent balls are placed slightly off horizontal to each other; the westerly ball should be just north of the peg and the easterly ball just south of the peg.  If this is not achieved, then it is likely that the opponent will have a 13-yard shot from somewhere on the court.

Advantages

Easy to finish from 4-back and peg after a missed lift

Disadvantages

Wiring at close range at the peg can easily go wrong
No polarity
Easy break pick-up if lift is hit

Cross-Wire
A cross-wiring leave is where you leave both opponent balls close together at a hoop, wired from each other.  Cross-wiring can be done at any hoop, although it is not considered a lift leave - you should only plan to cross-wire if you have not made a lift hoop during your turn, otherwise the opponent will probably have a very short shot from one of the baulk lines.



Red and yellow are cross-wired at black's hoop


There is a sequence you should try to follow when making most cross-wires, which is:

Before making your final hoop, arrange one opponent ball and partner ball at the intended cross-wiring hoop
Make your final hoop off the opponent ball and gain a rush towards the cross-wiring hoop
Wire the two opponent balls at the hoop
Rush the escape ball (partner) away to a far corner

Cross-wiring opportunities
Cross-wiring is not a lift leave, so unless you are planning on laying for sextuples, most of the opportunities to do so tend to arise more by chance.  For example, if your clips are for penult and 3-back, and you hit in with your ball for penult, you can safely make your last two hoops without conceding a lift. In the example below, blue is for penult, black for 3-back; yellow has just broken down at H6 on a break.  Click the solution button below the image to see how blue might go about playing its next turn.

As you can see, the cross-wire is an incredibly strong leave and you should always be on the lookout for opportunities to make it - it will give a very long shot to your opponent, and an easy break if they miss, putting you in a very strong game position.
The (delayed) sextuple leave (or "1-back leave")
The main reasoning for playing for sextuples at all is to avoid the conceding of a lift, and so it is here where we can take advantage of cross-wiring as a standard part of a leave.  Below is a common leave seen when laying for a sextuple, leaving red and yellow the longest possible shot on the court:  



A 1-back leave - red and yellow cross-wired at H1 with blue and black laid up near C3

To set this leave, you follow the same pattern outlined further above.  Before making hoop 6 (the final hoop of your turn), you should arrange one opponent and partner ball at hoop 1 (the cross-wiring hoop).  Make H6 with a rush back to H1 and cross-wire the opponent balls across the hoop, preferably diagonally, and gain a rush on partner ball towards C3.
The standard sextuple leave
Despite the name, this sextuple leave is rarely seen, both because it is much harder to get right, and also leaves a significantly shorter shot for the opponent.  The benefits of this leave as far as the sextuple goes is that it makes the sextuple turn a great deal easier, essentially nothing more than a quadruple peel. The standard sextuple leave is as follows:

                Click on the court to play the animation.  The action starts with blue running H4.



Close





As you can see, when setting this leave, you actually complete the cross-wiring after H5, then rush partner to H6 to score that hoop, afterwards gaining a rush to 1-back.  The reason this method is favoured for this particular leave is so that you can be rushing to 1-back from close range (near H6) instead of from near 2-back as you would have to do when performing the cross-wire after H6. Rushing to 1-back from close range helps you to obtain a good position for the jawsing of your ball in 1-back.
Polarity in cross-wiring leaves
In reality, leaving both opponent balls together (albeit wired from each other) means that there is little-to-no polarity to be had; however, there are some things you can do to still encourage one ball to play over the other.  Imagine that blue has cross-wired red and yellow at H1  (black's hoop).  Red is for 4-back and yellow is for peg, and as such, the striker of blue and black would want to  encourage yellow to play by substantially lengthening red's shot - the following leave is able to achieve this:



A 1-back leave with a degree of polarity - red is the opponent's backward ball so its shot at blue/black has been lengthened


Red is placed very near the south boundary as a deliberately poor pioneer at H1, and the length of red's shot is increased by 5-6 yards over what it would be in a normal cross-wire.  Placing red as a deliberately poor pioneer at H1 may encourage yellow to play.  Be aware, of course, that placing balls deliberately close to the boundary should only be done if you are confident of picking up a break from those positions afterwards, particularly bearing in mind that yellow may choose to corner.
Cross-wiring summary
Advantages

Ultimate distance between the opponent's balls and yours - normally 30+ yards
Gives you an easy break with a ball at your hoop if they miss

Disadvantages

No grey area - opponent is generally compelled to shoot
Not much polarity to be had
Opponent generally has an easy break if they hit (depending on clips)

Back to top

Third Turn Leaves
Generally when referring to a third-turn leave we are referring to when a player has hit on the third turn of the game and played a break to 4-back with 3 balls, then set a leave.  Bearing in mind that the fourth ball is not yet played into the game, the opponent does not have the option of which ball to play with their fourth-turn shot - they must play the remaining ball.  As such, there are opportunities to set a leave utilising the opponent's ball in close proximity to your own.
Three Ducks Leave
This leave is probably the most popular of all the third-turn leaves after a break to 4-back.



The standard Three Ducks leave after a break to 4-back by blue


The Three Ducks is so named because the balls are arranged like "ducks in a row", near the west boundary.  The best way to arrange this leave is to have your H1 ball near/on the west boundary, with the opponent ball about 1 yard further in-court and your 4-back ball another yard further in again - assuming an opponent miss, this then enables you to set an opponent ball as the H2 pioneer and take partner ball to H1 - which in turn will be sent to H3 / 4b for potential peeling opportunities later.
The Three Ducks is the most aggressive of the third-turn leaves and doesn't really leave any defensive option for the opponent.  Having said that, if the opponent takes the longer lift shot from C1 through to C2, it can be a bit tricky to dig the C2 ball out if you do not get a forward rush out of H1.  If no forward rush is achieved, you may choose to take off to C2 instead of croquet partner ball to H3.
Reverse Three Ducks Leave
A perfectly valid option, but far less frequently used.  This is a mirror image of the regular Three Ducks, although it is probably a bit more difficult to pick up a break from a missed lift.  It is easier to make than the regular Three Ducks as it doesn't require control out of 3b.



A reverse Three Ducks leave


If the opponent misses the shot from C3 to C4 there is an interesting opportunity to play a bombard on the in-lawn ball to H1 while approaching the ball in C4 - certainly it is not the kind of shot you would want to approach without having practised it, but if played successfully, gives an immediate 4-ball break.  
Third-Turn NSL
This leave is just like a regular NSL but obviously with a ball missing.  Again it's best to have your 4-back ball in the NSL position at H4, so the way you go about making this leave is slightly different than a normal NSL.



A third turn NSL by blue


After making 3-back you can rush partner out to the east boundary, then rush the opponent's ball back slightly south of 3-back.  A little stop shot is then played to send the opponent ball out towards partner while approaching the intended wired spot at H4 with striker's ball.
Another method would be to rush both partner and opponent out towards their east boundary positions, and then takeoff back to place your ball in the wired spot at H4. 
The fourth turn shot from the opponent is the exact equivalent of them lifting the ball from the west boundary and taking their lift shot.
Third-Turn Defensive Spread
The third-turn leave favoured by stronger players - this looks a lot like a DSL but with the peg ball missing.



A third-turn Defensive Spread by blue


After a fourth-turn miss from the opponent, the break pickup is similar to that of a DSL, but ideally the initial rush is left for the H1 ball on the opponent's ball, and your 4-back ball is placed on or near the west boundary. This gives the advantage of taking the rush to H1 with partner. 
When making this leave, very strong players will likely play their 4-back ball all the way to the west boundary with their final shot for blue, instead of lagging the ball a yard or two from the yardline - this adds more defence to the leave, and means that if the opponent does hit the long lift their break pick-up will be even more difficult.

Super Advanced Leaves

The Super Advanced game is a slightly modified version of association croquet that is played at championship level in England.  It incorporates an additional lift (at hoop 4) when compared to normal advanced rules, and hence changes the tactics and first-break leaves quite considerably.  As a result, all the golden rules for leave-making go out the window.  A separate article about super advanced first-break tactics and leaves is available here

Leaves
A "leave" in croquet is the culmination of the process of arranging the balls at the end of your turn.  The idea is that you keep the "innings", which normally means laying the court in an adventageous way for your partner ball, and that the opponent balls will be far apart, or at least wired from each other, with no short shots available.
What makes a good leave?

Your two balls close together with a useful rush
No shot shorter than 13 yards for the opponent, and no double target

What makes a great leave?

Your next turn is easier if the opponent misses than their turn is if they hit
No shot shorter than 17 yards for the opponent
Leaving some grey area - options available for the opponent to take a longer, more defensive shot
Polarity - influencing the opponent to play one ball over another, due to where it is positioned

Golden rules for making leaves
When all four balls are on the lawn, there are really two golden rules to leave-making that you should try to adhere to at all times.  Firstly, you should ensure that the very final ball you roquet in your turn should be your partner ball - this helps to organise a good rush for starting your next turn.  Secondly, you should try and ensure to always make your final hoop of the turn off an opponent's ball.  These two points are somewhat interrelated in that if you make your final hoop off the opponent, you will be roqueting it first after making the hoop, leaving partner ball "live" to be roqueted in a few strokes' time.

Diagonal Spread
The diagonal spread leave, or DSL for short, is probably the most commonly-attempted leave in croquet.  The reasons for this are that it is relatively easy to make, it is relatively forgiving if it goes horribly wrong, and doesn't leave any short shots from any baulk line.  It is a fairly hoop-agnostic leave, meaning that it is generally pretty easy to pick up a break from a DSL after a miss by the opponent, regardless of the hoop you are for.  In the example below, a DSL has been made after a break to 4-back by blue, with partner ball (black) for hoop 1.

As discussed in the golden rules above, the opponent ball is sent to 3-back (the final hoop of the turn).  Interestingly a good way to help achieve this is to organise earlier in the break to send partner to 2-back as an early pioneer after hoop 5 - if you send partner to 2-back then the 3-back pioneer will naturally be one of the opponent balls.
Before making 3-back you should organise the other opponent ball near the peg, fairly close to where you want its final position to be, and organise your partner ball 1-2 yards east of it to act as the escape ball. After making 3-back and croqueting the reception ball out towards the west boundary, you should try and rush the opponent ball by the peg into a wired spot immediately - the closer you can get it to the wired spot using a rush, the easier your job will be to wire it with the croquet stroke. Once the ball at the peg has been placed in the wired spot, you rush your escape ball (partner) out to the east boundary and lay a rush into the court for your partner ball, with both balls being wired from the ball at the peg, and ideally also wired from the ball near the west boundary.
Reverse DSL
A reverse diagonal spread is made in exactly the same way, but just organising the balls in a mirror-image, as in the diagram below.  Actually this can be quite a useful leave after a break to the peg when your partner ball is on 2-back, 3-back or 4-back as it makes picking up a break from any of these hoops fairly straightforward - certainly easier than a normal DSL.

The "B" Spread
If the diagonal spread is the most commonly-attempted leave, the "B" spread is probably the most commonly-completed leave.  Basically a "B" spread is a diagonal spread that has gone wrong when it comes to the wiring of the opponent balls at the peg.  Because the peg is narrow, the margins for error are fairly small.
Taking a step back, it is important to identify one of the most crucial parts of setting a DSL, and where a DSL is liable to go wrong - running 3-back.  Because of the distance between 3-back and the peg, it is quite important to get a forward rush out of 3-back to ensure that you are playing the crucial croquet stroke to place one oppo ball near the west boundary while approaching the other, from fairly close range.  It is very easy to lose control of the striker's ball when sending it more than a few yards in a croquet stroke and so any inaccuracies with the croquet stroke after 3-back stroke will compound in the placement of the ball near the peg. All too often, players will fail to get a rush out of 3-back, play a croquet stroke that leaves them a 2-yard roquet on the ball near the peg, and then roquet it so far out of position that they are unable to reliably croquet it back to the wired spot at the peg - this is by far the most common cause of the "B" spread.  If the ball near the peg is left open on the other opponent ball near the west boundary it generally results in leaving a 10-yard shot for the opponent.  



The difference between a DSL and a "B" spread - the image on the left shows red and yellow wired; the image on the right shows yellow is fully open on red


If you have gotten into a position whereby the opponent balls are left open across the peg, then it is worth considering not laying a rush for your partner, but instead wide-joining near corner 4, or in some cases even splitting up your balls completely, with one on the east boundary and the other in or near corner 2.
Do keep in mind that, although the "B" spread is a bad leave, a 10-yard shot still requires hitting, and it is a shot that is missed surprisingly frequently, even by strong players.  This is the advantage of attempting a diagonal spread - if it does go badly wrong and balls are left open, the opponent will still not have any shorter shot than around 10 yards. 
Backing out of a DSL
If your DSL is headed towards being a "B" spread then you have options to back out of it.  After making 3-back and sending an opponent ball towards the west boundary, it is at this point that you need to make a decision to continue with the DSL and risk a "B" spread or to back out and set an OSL - which we will look at further down this article.

Old Standard Leave
The Old Standard Leave, or OSL, was popular in earlier times, particularly in the 1960s.  Traditionally, the standard first-break tactic was to play your break to 4-back, peeling your partner through hoop 1 after 2-back, then after making 3-back to set an OSL (or "standard leave", as they were referred to at that time).  These days, the tactic of peeling partner through hoop 1 after 2-back is almost entirely extinct, as it is generally considered unhelpful - but the OSL is still a strong leave in its own right, whether partner is for H1 or H2.  The leave is very simple to make and leaves a 13-yard shot for the opponent ball at your balls in C4 from A Baulk.  There is no defensive option shot for the opponent to consider and they will have a fairly simple break pickup if they hit.

New Standard Leave
A new leave became popular in the 1990s in favour of the OSL, and is somewhat originally named the "New Standard Leave".  This leave is still one of the most popular leaves done today at the end of a break to 4-back.

There are 2 popular methods of making this leave:

With partner at 2-back - make 1-back off an opponent ball and place it near the west boundary after the hoop, then rush the other opponent ball down the court, loading it to 3-back as a pioneer; make 2-back off partner ball and get a rush to 3-back where the other opponent ball is waiting
With opponent at 2-back - make 2-back and croquet the opponent towards the west boundary while gaining a rush on partner towards 3-back where the other opponent ball is waiting

The first method has the advantage of giving good control over the placement of the west boundary ball whereas the second method has the advantage of not requiring an easterly rush out of 2-back.  Whichever method you choose, it is imperative that the 3-back pioneer is the opponent ball, because after making 3-back, the reception ball will need to be left in a very specific spot a few inches north-east of the hoop.
Placement of ball at H4
The trickiest part of setting the NSL is getting the ball at H4 accurately placed - you need to place it close enough to H4 that the ball will not have a backswing to shoot at your two balls on the east boundary.  You must also ensure that none of the ball is visible from A Baulk - even if an edge is visible it is sometimes possible for the opponent to shoot from A Baulk at a pseudo-double target with the edge of the ball at H4 and one of your balls in the background on the east boundary.  Finally, the ball must not be positioned in such a way that it does not rush to H1
In order to place the ball in the best spot, it is quite important that the approach is played from close-by and slightly south-east of the hoop. The hoop approach should ideally place the opponent ball just north of the ideal wired spot so that the hoop can be run past the reception ball and then roquet it back onto the perfect wired line - see the animation below:



Tap on the image to play the animation.


In the animation above, the grey circle indicates the ideal wired spot for red and the diagonal lines show the area which is wired from A Baulk.  It is perfectly reasonable to try and place the opponent ball in the ideal spot with the hoop approach - doing so will mean that you don't need to roquet it at all after the hoop and can instead just roquet black, leaving red where it is; but beware that trying to place red ideally in the hoop approach and leaving it short will make correcting the wiring more difficult - any roquet on a short red will only be sending it further away from the ideal spot.
Polarity
Unlike the diagonal spread, there is a certain amount of polarity in a NSL, meaning that you can influence the opponent's decision of which ball to play (or at least gain an easier break if they miss with the ball that they want to play) based on whether you place their backward or forward ball at H4 after 3-back.  This is more of an important decision in a game between stronger players who are capable of TP'ing, and also particularly in doubles this can be a critical tactical choice - for example if one of the opponents is a much weaker shot than the other, you would probably want to influence them to take the lift.
If the opponent chooses to lift their ball from H4 and take the "long" lift and misses from C3 to C4, then it is quite difficult for you to dig that ball out of C4 and into your break until you are for H4 yourself; on the other hand if the opponent lifts their ball from the west boundary and shoots from C3 to C4, it gives you the opportunity to establish a 4-ball break before you've even made H1 - you can do this by roqueting partner with your first shot, taking off to the C4 ball and playing a drive from C4, sending a pioneer to H2 while gaining a rush to H1 on the ball near H4.
Now consider that the opponent's clips are on penult and peg for example - it is highly likely in this scenario that the opponent will play their penult ball regardless of the ball positions.  Bearing this in mind, if you place the opponent's penult ball near the west boundary and their peg ball at H4, any missed lift with the penult ball will give you a greater chance at a 4-ball break and a possible TP.
A counter argument on the above scenario may be this: if the opponent (peg and penult) is bound to play their penult ball regardless of the ball positions, placing their penult ball on the west boundary may influence them to take the shorter lift shot from A Baulk instead of the longer shot from B Baulk, as they may correctly decide that missing any shot with their penult ball will give you a 4-ball break before H1.  Consider, instead, that placing the balls the "wrong" way round (peg ball on west boundary; penult ball at H4) and you may find your opponent will ultimately decide to take a longer shot with the penult ball than they may otherwise have done.  There is a balance of probabilities to be made between your expectation of the opponent hitting the long shot vs the short shot, and your reduced chances of making a game-winning break if they miss a more defensive shot into C4.

Advantages

Polarity - can influence opponent to play one ball or the other

Disadvantages

More tricky to make than a DSL
Easy to leave a double target from A Baulk if the ball at H4 is not perfectly placed

MSL (Maugham Standard Leave)
This is a variation on the NSL and was popularised by David Maugham, a leading player in the UK.  Compared to the NSL, instead of leaving a ball floating near the west boundary, after running 1-back under control you will croquet one of the opponent balls onto the middle of the west upright of H2.  In this position it cannot be rushed to H1 but acts as a perfect pioneer for H2.  As the ball at H2 is not rushable to H1, the rush is left for your partner ball to H1.



A MSL after a break by blue


This leave is more difficult to make than a NSL as it requires very good control of your break, particularly around 1-back, but there is a strong case to be made for it.  Assuming all the other clips are for H1, if the opponent lifts the ball from H4 and hits one of your balls down the east boundary from C3, then they will need to get a rush to H1 immediately.  Unless they just managed to snick the lift shot, then they are probably going to be faced with a long and difficult croquet stroke in order to obtain the rush to H1 on your other ball.
Placement of the ball at H2 after 1-back
The exact placement of the opponent ball onto the wire of H2 after running 1-back is shown in the animation below - tap on it to play.



Tap on the image to play the animation.


Blue makes 1-back off yellow with red as the escape ball for the southwards rush; partner (black) is the pioneer at 2-back.  When placing the ball on the wire of H2 after 1-back, you should endeavour to arrange the balls so that the placement is done from close range and can be done with a straight, gentle stop shot; playing this shot with any amount of split will mean that both the pace and the line will be much harder to judge.  Because you want to place the ball using a small straight stop shot, you should give some thought to the placement of the escape ball so that you will automatically gain a rush down the court on it without having to do anything with the striker's ball. 
Another advantage is that if the opponent lifts the ball from H4 and misses the long lift, you will be making H1 off partner (which is always comforting) and will have a perfect H2 pioneer.  This will pretty much guarantee that you are approaching H2 from a matter of inches away, and you can even look to get a dolly rush out of H2 towards C4 to develop the C4 ball before you have made H3.  Additionally, if you are looking at TPs, then having made H1 off partner, it will naturally be sent to H3 / 4b as a pioneer and potential peeling opportunity.
MSL summary
Advantages

Polarity - can influence opponent to play one ball or the other
You start next break by making H1 off partner
Probably the best leave for developing a standard triple opportunity
Potentially difficult break pickup for the opponent

Disadvantages

More tricky to make than a NSL or DSL
Rush to H1 from east boundary is slightly more difficult and is unlikely to be a dolly rush

Bryant Leave
This leave is named after NZ player Greg Bryant, who first started performing it regularly in 1993.  It is really the ultimate in aggressive leaves and is very difficult to make.  One ball is placed in the NSL position at H4, and the other is placed ideally about 1cm directly north of H1, or alternatively against the inside of one of the uprights, on the northern side.  Placement of this ball is difficult to get right and it is very important that none of the ball is showing through H1 on the southern side where it may be easy to hit from A Baulk.  



A Bryant Leave by blue


If you are preparing to make a Bryant Leave, then you must have an opponent ball as your 2-back pioneer.  Having a very close pioneer is important here, and you may consider placing it at 2-back from close range after H5 - ideally the pioneer will be 12 inches or less from 2-back. You should also have the other opponent ball at 1-back as the pioneer, which will naturally be sent out afterwards as the 3-back pioneer
Placement of the opponent ball at H1
This is the crucial part of the Bryant leave.  After making 1-back and loading the opponent ball to 3-back, you need a good rush on the pivot ball towards 2-back.  The pivot should then be placed around 1 yard east and 1 foot north of 2-back as an escape ball before you make 2-back off the opponent ball.



Tap on the image to play the animation.


After 2-back, roquet the opponent reception ball back in front of 2-back as close as possible and then place it into the required position with a delicate stop shot.  After that, you can roquet your escape ball (partner) towards 3-back and make the hoop off the other opponent ball, setting it in the NSL position afterwards.
Bryant Leave summary
Advantages

Opponent has no defensive shot so any miss will give you all the balls immediately
Artificial polarity - the opponent will still be more inclined to lift the ball from H1 despite having no safe shots
If the ball placed at H4 is for H2, it can be very tough to pick up a break after hitting the lift
Looks really cool

Disadvantages

There is no grey area - opponent has no defensive shot so may as well take the shortest shot
Difficult to make

Defensive Spread
A very good, and probably under-used, leave.  This leave is great if you are the stronger player playing against a weaker player.  While it only leaves a 13-yard lift shot, it gives very poor break prospects if the lift is hit.

The leave above is one variation of the defensive spread - a mirror image of the same leave can also be made, with blue/black laid up in C4 and one opponent ball near C2 and the other peg-high on the east boundary.
The variation where blue and black are laid up in C2 is an incredibly strong leave when red is for H3 (either by breaking down or by POPs during blue's break) and yellow is for 4-back - if red hits any lift shot whatsoever, its break  prospects are slim at best; on the other hand, a miss by red gives black strong prospects of starting a second break.  Even a more defensive miss of yellow at black gives fairly good break prospects for black.
This leave is perhaps at its best on a difficult lawn where picking up breaks is more challenging, and so you do not want to gift the opponent a break with balls in the middle of the court if they happen to hit your lift.  
Defensive Spread summary
Advantages

Very strong - if the clips are right

Polarity - the opponent has aggressive and defensive lift shot options

Vertical Spread
The vertical spread is generally thought of as a second-break leave, meaning that you would look to make this leave at the end of a break to the peg, normally when your partner has well advanced clips.  It is quite common to see players make this leave when their partner ball is for 4-back, however I would not advise doing so - it can be very difficult to finish from 4-back and peg after a miss by the opponent, and there are generally better leave options available for these clips.

The Vertical Spread is actually quite easy to make, because the opponent balls can be placed from close range after running penult and rover without having to play any difficult shots.  The exact placement of the two balls at penult and rover is also not as crucial as it is when placing a ball on the back of H1 for example, because penult and rover are further from baulk.  Still, you should aim to achieve ideal position of the two opponent balls as it will give greater flexibility when deciding where to lay your own balls up at the conclusion of the turn.  The ball at penult should be placed in the front of the jaws of H6 - it is also fine to be up against one wire or the other, so long as it is on the inside of the wire and not visible from baulk, and the ball should ideally not be showing through the hoop on the non-playing side of H6.  The position for the ball at rover is essentially the same, but mirrored.
The most obvious use case for this leave is when partner (black in this case) is for penult, as it will give you an easy finishing turn from any missed lift.  Please note the diagram above has the opponent balls laid up on the east boundary, but you can just as easily lay up on the west boundary, which may enable an easier rush to penult.
You can also think of this leave as a fairly defensive leave.  If the opponent already has an advanced clip, e.g. they are for 4-back and H1, then you should try and arrange their forward ball to be the ball left south of penult. Doing this will encourage them to lift their forward ball, however if they do decide to shoot and hit with their backward ball, their break pick-up will be very difficult indeed, because the ball left in penult cannot be rushed to either H1 or H2.
Vertical spread summary
Advantages

Relatively easy to make
Very strong break prospects for your partner ball (if the clips are right)
Very poor break prospects for the opponent ball (if the clips are right)

Disadvantages

Limited value if partner clip is not for penult (or H5)

Cross-Peg
You can think of the cross-peg leave a bit like a diagonal spread, but with the west boundary ball about 12 yards further in court than normal.  The way you go about making the cross-peg is the essentially the same as that of the DSL, but after making your final hoop of the turn, you need to get a good rush to the peg where the other two balls are waiting.



A cross-peg after a break to the peg by blue


Because the rush out of your final hoop is so crucial to getting a good cross-peg, you would not frequently see this leave after a break to 4-back - making 3-back with control and a dolly rush to the peg is relatively difficult for relatively little gain in having a cross-peg instead of a DSL.  It is much more common to set this leave after running rover when your partner is for 4-back or penult.  Running rover and obtaining a dolly rush to the peg is significantly easier than the same out of 3-back, and what's more, rover is significantly closer to the peg than 3-back is.  The benefit of a cross-peg over a DSL is also more evident when for 4-back, because at the start of your next turn you will avoid the slightly tricky cross-court rushes from the east boundary to the west boundary, and also from there to 4-back.  



Tap on the image to play the animation.


The crucial thing to remember when setting the cross-peg leave (aside from the actual wiring itself) is that you should make sure the two opponent balls are placed slightly off horizontal to each other; the westerly ball should be just north of the peg and the easterly ball just south of the peg.  If this is not achieved, then it is likely that the opponent will have a 13-yard shot from somewhere on the court.

Advantages

Easy to finish from 4-back and peg after a missed lift

Wiring at close range at the peg can easily go wrong

Cross-Wire
A cross-wiring leave is where you leave both opponent balls close together at a hoop, wired from each other.  Cross-wiring can be done at any hoop, although it is not considered a lift leave - you should only plan to cross-wire if you have not made a lift hoop during your turn, otherwise the opponent will probably have a very short shot from one of the baulk lines.



Red and yellow are cross-wired at black's hoop


There is a sequence you should try to follow when making most cross-wires, which is:

Before making your final hoop, arrange one opponent ball and partner ball at the intended cross-wiring hoop
Make your final hoop off the opponent ball and gain a rush towards the cross-wiring hoop
Wire the two opponent balls at the hoop
Rush the escape ball (partner) away to a far corner

Cross-wiring opportunities
Cross-wiring is not a lift leave, so unless you are planning on laying for sextuples, most of the opportunities to do so tend to arise more by chance.  For example, if your clips are for penult and 3-back, and you hit in with your ball for penult, you can safely make your last two hoops without conceding a lift. In the example below, blue is for penult, black for 3-back; yellow has just broken down at H6 on a break.  Click the solution button below the image to see how blue might go about playing its next turn.

As you can see, the cross-wire is an incredibly strong leave and you should always be on the lookout for opportunities to make it - it will give a very long shot to your opponent, and an easy break if they miss, putting you in a very strong game position.
The (delayed) sextuple leave (or "1-back leave")
The main reasoning for playing for sextuples at all is to avoid the conceding of a lift, and so it is here where we can take advantage of cross-wiring as a standard part of a leave.  Below is a common leave seen when laying for a sextuple, leaving red and yellow the longest possible shot on the court:

To set this leave, you follow the same pattern outlined further above.  Before making hoop 6 (the final hoop of your turn), you should arrange one opponent and partner ball at hoop 1 (the cross-wiring hoop).  Make H6 with a rush back to H1 and cross-wire the opponent balls across the hoop, preferably diagonally, and gain a rush on partner ball towards C3.
The standard sextuple leave
Despite the name, this sextuple leave is rarely seen, both because it is much harder to get right, and also leaves a significantly shorter shot for the opponent.  The benefits of this leave as far as the sextuple goes is that it makes the sextuple turn a great deal easier, essentially nothing more than a quadruple peel. The standard sextuple leave is as follows:

As you can see, when setting this leave, you actually complete the cross-wiring after H5, then rush partner to H6 to score that hoop, afterwards gaining a rush to 1-back.  The reason this method is favoured for this particular leave is so that you can be rushing to 1-back from close range (near H6) instead of from near 2-back as you would have to do when performing the cross-wire after H6. Rushing to 1-back from close range helps you to obtain a good position for the jawsing of your ball in 1-back.
Polarity in cross-wiring leaves
In reality, leaving both opponent balls together (albeit wired from each other) means that there is little-to-no polarity to be had; however, there are some things you can do to still encourage one ball to play over the other.  Imagine that blue has cross-wired red and yellow at H1  (black's hoop).  Red is for 4-back and yellow is for peg, and as such, the striker of blue and black would want to  encourage yellow to play by substantially lengthening red's shot - the following leave is able to achieve this:



A 1-back leave with a degree of polarity - red is the opponent's backward ball so its shot at blue/black has been lengthened


Red is placed very near the south boundary as a deliberately poor pioneer at H1, and the length of red's shot is increased by 5-6 yards over what it would be in a normal cross-wire.  Placing red as a deliberately poor pioneer at H1 may encourage yellow to play.  Be aware, of course, that placing balls deliberately close to the boundary should only be done if you are confident of picking up a break from those positions afterwards, particularly bearing in mind that yellow may choose to corner.
Cross-wiring summary
Advantages

Ultimate distance between the opponent's balls and yours - normally 30+ yards
Gives you an easy break with a ball at your hoop if they miss

Disadvantages

No grey area - opponent is generally compelled to shoot
Not much polarity to be had
Opponent generally has an easy break if they hit (depending on clips)

Third Turn Leaves
Generally when referring to a third-turn leave we are referring to when a player has hit on the third turn of the game and played a break to 4-back with 3 balls, then set a leave.  Bearing in mind that the fourth ball is not yet played into the game, the opponent does not have the option of which ball to play with their fourth-turn shot - they must play the remaining ball.  As such, there are opportunities to set a leave utilising the opponent's ball in close proximity to your own.
Three Ducks Leave
This leave is probably the most popular of all the third-turn leaves after a break to 4-back.



The standard Three Ducks leave after a break to 4-back by blue


The Three Ducks is so named because the balls are arranged like "ducks in a row", near the west boundary.  The best way to arrange this leave is to have your H1 ball near/on the west boundary, with the opponent ball about 1 yard further in-court and your 4-back ball another yard further in again - assuming an opponent miss, this then enables you to set an opponent ball as the H2 pioneer and take partner ball to H1 - which in turn will be sent to H3 / 4b for potential peeling opportunities later.
The Three Ducks is the most aggressive of the third-turn leaves and doesn't really leave any defensive option for the opponent.  Having said that, if the opponent takes the longer lift shot from C1 through to C2, it can be a bit tricky to dig the C2 ball out if you do not get a forward rush out of H1.  If no forward rush is achieved, you may choose to take off to C2 instead of croquet partner ball to H3.
Reverse Three Ducks Leave
A perfectly valid option, but far less frequently used.  This is a mirror image of the regular Three Ducks, although it is probably a bit more difficult to pick up a break from a missed lift.  It is easier to make than the regular Three Ducks as it doesn't require control out of 3b.



A reverse Three Ducks leave


If the opponent misses the shot from C3 to C4 there is an interesting opportunity to play a bombard on the in-lawn ball to H1 while approaching the ball in C4 - certainly it is not the kind of shot you would want to approach without having practised it, but if played successfully, gives an immediate 4-ball break.  
Third-Turn NSL
This leave is just like a regular NSL but obviously with a ball missing.  Again it's best to have your 4-back ball in the NSL position at H4, so the way you go about making this leave is slightly different than a normal NSL.



A third turn NSL by blue


After making 3-back you can rush partner out to the east boundary, then rush the opponent's ball back slightly south of 3-back.  A little stop shot is then played to send the opponent ball out towards partner while approaching the intended wired spot at H4 with striker's ball.
Another method would be to rush both partner and opponent out towards their east boundary positions, and then takeoff back to place your ball in the wired spot at H4. 
The fourth turn shot from the opponent is the exact equivalent of them lifting the ball from the west boundary and taking their lift shot.
Third-Turn Defensive Spread
The third-turn leave favoured by stronger players - this looks a lot like a DSL but with the peg ball missing.



A third-turn Defensive Spread by blue


After a fourth-turn miss from the opponent, the break pickup is similar to that of a DSL, but ideally the initial rush is left for the H1 ball on the opponent's ball, and your 4-back ball is placed on or near the west boundary. This gives the advantage of taking the rush to H1 with partner. 
When making this leave, very strong players will likely play their 4-back ball all the way to the west boundary with their final shot for blue, instead of lagging the ball a yard or two from the yardline - this adds more defence to the leave, and means that if the opponent does hit the long lift their break pick-up will be even more difficult.

Super Advanced Leaves

The Super Advanced game is a slightly modified version of association croquet that is played at championship level in England.  It incorporates an additional lift (at hoop 4) when compared to normal advanced rules, and hence changes the tactics and first-break leaves quite considerably.  As a result, all the golden rules for leave-making go out the window.  A separate article about super advanced first-break tactics and leaves is available here

Leaves


Leaves
A "leave" in croquet is the culmination of the process of arranging the balls at the end of your turn.  The idea is that you keep the "innings", which normally means laying the court in an adventageous way for your partner ball, and that the opponent balls will be far apart, or at least wired from each other, with no short shots available.
What makes a good leave?

Your two balls close together with a useful rush
No shot shorter than 13 yards for the opponent, and no double target

What makes a great leave?

Your next turn is easier if the opponent misses than their turn is if they hit
No shot shorter than 17 yards for the opponent
Leaving some grey area - options available for the opponent to take a longer, more defensive shot
Polarity - influencing the opponent to play one ball over another, due to where it is positioned

Golden rules for making leaves
When all four balls are on the lawn, there are really two golden rules to leave-making that you should try to adhere to at all times.  Firstly, you should ensure that the very final ball you roquet in your turn should be your partner ball - this helps to organise a good rush for starting your next turn.  Secondly, you should try and ensure to always make your final hoop of the turn off an opponent's ball.  These two points are somewhat interrelated in that if you make your final hoop off the opponent, you will be roqueting it first after making the hoop, leaving partner ball "live" to be roqueted in a few strokes' time.

Diagonal Spread
The diagonal spread leave, or DSL for short, is probably the most commonly-attempted leave in croquet.  The reasons for this are that it is relatively easy to make, it is relatively forgiving if it goes horribly wrong, and doesn't leave any short shots from any baulk line.  It is a fairly hoop-agnostic leave, meaning that it is generally pretty easy to pick up a break from a DSL after a miss by the opponent, regardless of the hoop you are for.  In the example below, a DSL has been made after a break to 4-back by blue, with partner ball (black) for hoop 1.

As discussed in the golden rules above, the opponent ball is sent to 3-back (the final hoop of the turn).  Interestingly a good way to help achieve this is to organise earlier in the break to send partner to 2-back as an early pioneer after hoop 5 - if you send partner to 2-back then the 3-back pioneer will naturally be one of the opponent balls.
Before making 3-back you should organise the other opponent ball near the peg, fairly close to where you want its final position to be, and organise your partner ball 1-2 yards east of it to act as the escape ball. After making 3-back and croqueting the reception ball out towards the west boundary, you should try and rush the opponent ball by the peg into a wired spot immediately - the closer you can get it to the wired spot using a rush, the easier your job will be to wire it with the croquet stroke. Once the ball at the peg has been placed in the wired spot, you rush your escape ball (partner) out to the east boundary and lay a rush into the court for your partner ball, with both balls being wired from the ball at the peg, and ideally also wired from the ball near the west boundary.
Reverse DSL
A reverse diagonal spread is made in exactly the same way, but just organising the balls in a mirror-image, as in the diagram below.  Actually this can be quite a useful leave after a break to the peg when your partner ball is on 2-back, 3-back or 4-back as it makes picking up a break from any of these hoops fairly straightforward - certainly easier than a normal DSL.



A reverse DSL


The "B" Spread
If the diagonal spread is the most commonly-attempted leave, the "B" spread is probably the most commonly-completed leave.  Basically a "B" spread is a diagonal spread that has gone wrong when it comes to the wiring of the opponent balls at the peg.  Because the peg is narrow, the margins for error are fairly small.
Taking a step back, it is important to identify one of the most crucial parts of setting a DSL, and where a DSL is liable to go wrong - running 3-back.  Because of the distance between 3-back and the peg, it is quite important to get a forward rush out of 3-back to ensure that you are playing the crucial croquet stroke to place one oppo ball near the west boundary while approaching the other, from fairly close range.  It is very easy to lose control of the striker's ball when sending it more than a few yards in a croquet stroke and so any inaccuracies with the croquet stroke after 3-back stroke will compound in the placement of the ball near the peg. All too often, players will fail to get a rush out of 3-back, play a croquet stroke that leaves them a 2-yard roquet on the ball near the peg, and then roquet it so far out of position that they are unable to reliably croquet it back to the wired spot at the peg - this is by far the most common cause of the "B" spread.  If the ball near the peg is left open on the other opponent ball near the west boundary it generally results in leaving a 10-yard shot for the opponent.  



The difference between a DSL and a "B" spread - the image on the left shows red and yellow wired; the image on the right shows yellow is fully open on red


If you have gotten into a position whereby the opponent balls are left open across the peg, then it is worth considering not laying a rush for your partner, but instead wide-joining near corner 4, or in some cases even splitting up your balls completely, with one on the east boundary and the other in or near corner 2.
Do keep in mind that, although the "B" spread is a bad leave, a 10-yard shot still requires hitting, and it is a shot that is missed surprisingly frequently, even by strong players.  This is the advantage of attempting a diagonal spread - if it does go badly wrong and balls are left open, the opponent will still not have any shorter shot than around 10 yards. 
Backing out of a DSL
If your DSL is headed towards being a "B" spread then you have options to back out of it.  After making 3-back and sending an opponent ball towards the west boundary, it is at this point that you need to make a decision to continue with the DSL and risk a "B" spread or to back out and set an OSL - which we will look at further down this article.

Old Standard Leave
The Old Standard Leave, or OSL, was popular in earlier times, particularly in the 1960s.  Traditionally, the standard first-break tactic was to play your break to 4-back, peeling your partner through hoop 1 after 2-back, then after making 3-back to set an OSL (or "standard leave", as they were referred to at that time).  These days, the tactic of peeling partner through hoop 1 after 2-back is almost entirely extinct, as it is generally considered unhelpful - but the OSL is still a strong leave in its own right, whether partner is for H1 or H2.  The leave is very simple to make and leaves a 13-yard shot for the opponent ball at your balls in C4 from A Baulk.  There is no defensive option shot for the opponent to consider and they will have a fairly simple break pickup if they hit.

New Standard Leave
A new leave became popular in the 1990s in favour of the OSL, and is somewhat originally named the "New Standard Leave".  This leave is still one of the most popular leaves done today at the end of a break to 4-back.

There are 2 popular methods of making this leave:

With partner at 2-back - make 1-back off an opponent ball and place it near the west boundary after the hoop, then rush the other opponent ball down the court, loading it to 3-back as a pioneer; make 2-back off partner ball and get a rush to 3-back where the other opponent ball is waiting
With opponent at 2-back - make 2-back and croquet the opponent towards the west boundary while gaining a rush on partner towards 3-back where the other opponent ball is waiting

The first method has the advantage of giving good control over the placement of the west boundary ball whereas the second method has the advantage of not requiring an easterly rush out of 2-back.  Whichever method you choose, it is imperative that the 3-back pioneer is the opponent ball, because after making 3-back, the reception ball will need to be left in a very specific spot a few inches north-east of the hoop.
Placement of ball at H4
The trickiest part of setting the NSL is getting the ball at H4 accurately placed - you need to place it close enough to H4 that the ball will not have a backswing to shoot at your two balls on the east boundary.  You must also ensure that none of the ball is visible from A Baulk - even if an edge is visible it is sometimes possible for the opponent to shoot from A Baulk at a pseudo-double target with the edge of the ball at H4 and one of your balls in the background on the east boundary.  Finally, the ball must not be positioned in such a way that it does not rush to H1
In order to place the ball in the best spot, it is quite important that the approach is played from close-by and slightly south-east of the hoop. The hoop approach should ideally place the opponent ball just north of the ideal wired spot so that the hoop can be run past the reception ball and then roquet it back onto the perfect wired line - see the animation below:



Tap on the image to play the animation.


In the animation above, the grey circle indicates the ideal wired spot for red and the diagonal lines show the area which is wired from A Baulk.  It is perfectly reasonable to try and place the opponent ball in the ideal spot with the hoop approach - doing so will mean that you don't need to roquet it at all after the hoop and can instead just roquet black, leaving red where it is; but beware that trying to place red ideally in the hoop approach and leaving it short will make correcting the wiring more difficult - any roquet on a short red will only be sending it further away from the ideal spot.
Polarity
Unlike the diagonal spread, there is a certain amount of polarity in a NSL, meaning that you can influence the opponent's decision of which ball to play (or at least gain an easier break if they miss with the ball that they want to play) based on whether you place their backward or forward ball at H4 after 3-back.  This is more of an important decision in a game between stronger players who are capable of TP'ing, and also particularly in doubles this can be a critical tactical choice - for example if one of the opponents is a much weaker shot than the other, you would probably want to influence them to take the lift.
If the opponent chooses to lift their ball from H4 and take the "long" lift and misses from C3 to C4, then it is quite difficult for you to dig that ball out of C4 and into your break until you are for H4 yourself; on the other hand if the opponent lifts their ball from the west boundary and shoots from C3 to C4, it gives you the opportunity to establish a 4-ball break before you've even made H1 - you can do this by roqueting partner with your first shot, taking off to the C4 ball and playing a drive from C4, sending a pioneer to H2 while gaining a rush to H1 on the ball near H4.
Now consider that the opponent's clips are on penult and peg for example - it is highly likely in this scenario that the opponent will play their penult ball regardless of the ball positions.  Bearing this in mind, if you place the opponent's penult ball near the west boundary and their peg ball at H4, any missed lift with the penult ball will give you a greater chance at a 4-ball break and a possible TP.
A counter argument on the above scenario may be this: if the opponent (peg and penult) is bound to play their penult ball regardless of the ball positions, placing their penult ball on the west boundary may influence them to take the shorter lift shot from A Baulk instead of the longer shot from B Baulk, as they may correctly decide that missing any shot with their penult ball will give you a 4-ball break before H1.  Consider, instead, that placing the balls the "wrong" way round (peg ball on west boundary; penult ball at H4) and you may find your opponent will ultimately decide to take a longer shot with the penult ball than they may otherwise have done.  There is a balance of probabilities to be made between your expectation of the opponent hitting the long shot vs the short shot, and your reduced chances of making a game-winning break if they miss a more defensive shot into C4.
NSL summary
Advantages

Polarity - can influence opponent to play one ball or the other

Disadvantages

More tricky to make than a DSL
Easy to leave a double target from A Baulk if the ball at H4 is not perfectly placed

MSL (Maugham Standard Leave)
This is a variation on the NSL and was popularised by David Maugham, a leading player in the UK.  Compared to the NSL, instead of leaving a ball floating near the west boundary, after running 1-back under control you will croquet one of the opponent balls onto the middle of the west upright of H2.  In this position it cannot be rushed to H1 but acts as a perfect pioneer for H2.  As the ball at H2 is not rushable to H1, the rush is left for your partner ball to H1.



A MSL after a break by blue


This leave is more difficult to make than a NSL as it requires very good control of your break, particularly around 1-back, but there is a strong case to be made for it.  Assuming all the other clips are for H1, if the opponent lifts the ball from H4 and hits one of your balls down the east boundary from C3, then they will need to get a rush to H1 immediately.  Unless they just managed to snick the lift shot, then they are probably going to be faced with a long and difficult croquet stroke in order to obtain the rush to H1 on your other ball.
Placement of the ball at H2 after 1-back
The exact placement of the opponent ball onto the wire of H2 after running 1-back is shown in the animation below - tap on it to play.



Tap on the image to play the animation.


Blue makes 1-back off yellow with red as the escape ball for the southwards rush; partner (black) is the pioneer at 2-back.  When placing the ball on the wire of H2 after 1-back, you should endeavour to arrange the balls so that the placement is done from close range and can be done with a straight, gentle stop shot; playing this shot with any amount of split will mean that both the pace and the line will be much harder to judge.  Because you want to place the ball using a small straight stop shot, you should give some thought to the placement of the escape ball so that you will automatically gain a rush down the court on it without having to do anything with the striker's ball. 
Another advantage is that if the opponent lifts the ball from H4 and misses the long lift, you will be making H1 off partner (which is always comforting) and will have a perfect H2 pioneer.  This will pretty much guarantee that you are approaching H2 from a matter of inches away, and you can even look to get a dolly rush out of H2 towards C4 to develop the C4 ball before you have made H3.  Additionally, if you are looking at TPs, then having made H1 off partner, it will naturally be sent to H3 / 4b as a pioneer and potential peeling opportunity.
MSL summary
Advantages

Polarity - can influence opponent to play one ball or the other
You start next break by making H1 off partner
Probably the best leave for developing a standard triple opportunity
Potentially difficult break pickup for the opponent

Disadvantages

More tricky to make than a NSL or DSL
Rush to H1 from east boundary is slightly more difficult and is unlikely to be a dolly rush

Bryant Leave
This leave is named after NZ player Greg Bryant, who first started performing it regularly in 1993.  It is really the ultimate in aggressive leaves and is very difficult to make.  One ball is placed in the NSL position at H4, and the other is placed ideally about 1cm directly north of H1, or alternatively against the inside of one of the uprights, on the northern side.  Placement of this ball is difficult to get right and it is very important that none of the ball is showing through H1 on the southern side where it may be easy to hit from A Baulk.  



A Bryant Leave by blue


If you are preparing to make a Bryant Leave, then you must have an opponent ball as your 2-back pioneer.  Having a very close pioneer is important here, and you may consider placing it at 2-back from close range after H5 - ideally the pioneer will be 12 inches or less from 2-back. You should also have the other opponent ball at 1-back as the pioneer, which will naturally be sent out afterwards as the 3-back pioneer
Placement of the opponent ball at H1
This is the crucial part of the Bryant leave.  After making 1-back and loading the opponent ball to 3-back, you need a good rush on the pivot ball towards 2-back.  The pivot should then be placed around 1 yard east and 1 foot north of 2-back as an escape ball before you make 2-back off the opponent ball.



Tap on the image to play the animation.


After 2-back, roquet the opponent reception ball back in front of 2-back as close as possible and then place it into the required position with a delicate stop shot.  After that, you can roquet your escape ball (partner) towards 3-back and make the hoop off the other opponent ball, setting it in the NSL position afterwards.
Bryant Leave summary
Advantages

Opponent has no defensive shot so any miss will give you all the balls immediately
Artificial polarity - the opponent will still be more inclined to lift the ball from H1 despite having no safe shots
If the ball placed at H4 is for H2, it can be very tough to pick up a break after hitting the lift
Looks really cool

Disadvantages

There is no grey area - opponent has no defensive shot so may as well take the shortest shot
Difficult to make

Defensive Spread
A very good, and probably under-used, leave.  This leave is great if you are the stronger player playing against a weaker player.  While it only leaves a 13-yard lift shot, it gives very poor break prospects if the lift is hit.

The leave above is one variation of the defensive spread - a mirror image of the same leave can also be made, with blue/black laid up in C4 and one opponent ball near C2 and the other peg-high on the east boundary.
The variation where blue and black are laid up in C2 is an incredibly strong leave when red is for H3 (either by breaking down or by POPs during blue's break) and yellow is for 4-back - if red hits any lift shot whatsoever, its break  prospects are slim at best; on the other hand, a miss by red gives black strong prospects of starting a second break.  Even a more defensive miss of yellow at black gives fairly good break prospects for black.
This leave is perhaps at its best on a difficult lawn where picking up breaks is more challenging, and so you do not want to gift the opponent a break with balls in the middle of the court if they happen to hit your lift.  
Defensive Spread summary
Advantages

Very strong - if the clips are right
Gives very slim break prospects to your opponent if they hit the lift
Polarity - the opponent has aggressive and defensive lift shot options

Disadvantages

13-yard lift shot is conceded
Requires several accurate rushes to get exactly right

Vertical Spread
The vertical spread is generally thought of as a second-break leave, meaning that you would look to make this leave at the end of a break to the peg, normally when your partner has well advanced clips.  It is quite common to see players make this leave when their partner ball is for 4-back, however I would not advise doing so - it can be very difficult to finish from 4-back and peg after a miss by the opponent, and there are generally better leave options available for these clips.

The Vertical Spread is actually quite easy to make, because the opponent balls can be placed from close range after running penult and rover without having to play any difficult shots.  The exact placement of the two balls at penult and rover is also not as crucial as it is when placing a ball on the back of H1 for example, because penult and rover are further from baulk.  Still, you should aim to achieve ideal position of the two opponent balls as it will give greater flexibility when deciding where to lay your own balls up at the conclusion of the turn.  The ball at penult should be placed in the front of the jaws of H6 - it is also fine to be up against one wire or the other, so long as it is on the inside of the wire and not visible from baulk, and the ball should ideally not be showing through the hoop on the non-playing side of H6.  The position for the ball at rover is essentially the same, but mirrored.
The most obvious use case for this leave is when partner (black in this case) is for penult, as it will give you an easy finishing turn from any missed lift.  Please note the diagram above has the opponent balls laid up on the east boundary, but you can just as easily lay up on the west boundary, which may enable an easier rush to penult.
You can also think of this leave as a fairly defensive leave.  If the opponent already has an advanced clip, e.g. they are for 4-back and H1, then you should try and arrange their forward ball to be the ball left south of penult. Doing this will encourage them to lift their forward ball, however if they do decide to shoot and hit with their backward ball, their break pick-up will be very difficult indeed, because the ball left in penult cannot be rushed to either H1 or H2.
Vertical spread summary
Advantages

Relatively easy to make
Very strong break prospects for your partner ball (if the clips are right)
Very poor break prospects for the opponent ball (if the clips are right)

Disadvantages

Limited value if partner clip is not for penult (or H5)

Cross-Peg
You can think of the cross-peg leave a bit like a diagonal spread, but with the west boundary ball about 12 yards further in court than normal.  The way you go about making the cross-peg is the essentially the same as that of the DSL, but after making your final hoop of the turn, you need to get a good rush to the peg where the other two balls are waiting.



A cross-peg after a break to the peg by blue


Because the rush out of your final hoop is so crucial to getting a good cross-peg, you would not frequently see this leave after a break to 4-back - making 3-back with control and a dolly rush to the peg is relatively difficult for relatively little gain in having a cross-peg instead of a DSL.  It is much more common to set this leave after running rover when your partner is for 4-back or penult.  Running rover and obtaining a dolly rush to the peg is significantly easier than the same out of 3-back, and what's more, rover is significantly closer to the peg than 3-back is.  The benefit of a cross-peg over a DSL is also more evident when for 4-back, because at the start of your next turn you will avoid the slightly tricky cross-court rushes from the east boundary to the west boundary, and also from there to 4-back.  



Tap on the image to play the animation.


The crucial thing to remember when setting the cross-peg leave (aside from the actual wiring itself) is that you should make sure the two opponent balls are placed slightly off horizontal to each other; the westerly ball should be just north of the peg and the easterly ball just south of the peg.  If this is not achieved, then it is likely that the opponent will have a 13-yard shot from somewhere on the court.

Advantages

Easy to finish from 4-back and peg after a missed lift

Cross-Wire
A cross-wiring leave is where you leave both opponent balls close together at a hoop, wired from each other.  Cross-wiring can be done at any hoop, although it is not considered a lift leave - you should only plan to cross-wire if you have not made a lift hoop during your turn, otherwise the opponent will probably have a very short shot from one of the baulk lines.



Red and yellow are cross-wired at black's hoop


There is a sequence you should try to follow when making most cross-wires, which is:

Before making your final hoop, arrange one opponent ball and partner ball at the intended cross-wiring hoop
Make your final hoop off the opponent ball and gain a rush towards the cross-wiring hoop
Wire the two opponent balls at the hoop
Rush the escape ball (partner) away to a far corner

Cross-wiring opportunities
Cross-wiring is not a lift leave, so unless you are planning on laying for sextuples, most of the opportunities to do so tend to arise more by chance.  For example, if your clips are for penult and 3-back, and you hit in with your ball for penult, you can safely make your last two hoops without conceding a lift. In the example below, blue is for penult, black for 3-back; yellow has just broken down at H6 on a break.  Click the solution button below the image to see how blue might go about playing its next turn.

As you can see, the cross-wire is an incredibly strong leave and you should always be on the lookout for opportunities to make it - it will give a very long shot to your opponent, and an easy break if they miss, putting you in a very strong game position.
The (delayed) sextuple leave (or "1-back leave")
The main reasoning for playing for sextuples at all is to avoid the conceding of a lift, and so it is here where we can take advantage of cross-wiring as a standard part of a leave.  Below is a common leave seen when laying for a sextuple, leaving red and yellow the longest possible shot on the court:  



A 1-back leave - red and yellow cross-wired at H1 with blue and black laid up near C3

To set this leave, you follow the same pattern outlined further above.  Before making hoop 6 (the final hoop of your turn), you should arrange one opponent and partner ball at hoop 1 (the cross-wiring hoop).  Make H6 with a rush back to H1 and cross-wire the opponent balls across the hoop, preferably diagonally, and gain a rush on partner ball towards C3.
The standard sextuple leave
Despite the name, this sextuple leave is rarely seen, both because it is much harder to get right, and also leaves a significantly shorter shot for the opponent.  The benefits of this leave as far as the sextuple goes is that it makes the sextuple turn a great deal easier, essentially nothing more than a quadruple peel. The standard sextuple leave is as follows:

As you can see, when setting this leave, you actually complete the cross-wiring after H5, then rush partner to H6 to score that hoop, afterwards gaining a rush to 1-back.  The reason this method is favoured for this particular leave is so that you can be rushing to 1-back from close range (near H6) instead of from near 2-back as you would have to do when performing the cross-wire after H6. Rushing to 1-back from close range helps you to obtain a good position for the jawsing of your ball in 1-back.
Polarity in cross-wiring leaves
In reality, leaving both opponent balls together (albeit wired from each other) means that there is little-to-no polarity to be had; however, there are some things you can do to still encourage one ball to play over the other.  Imagine that blue has cross-wired red and yellow at H1  (black's hoop).  Red is for 4-back and yellow is for peg, and as such, the striker of blue and black would want to  encourage yellow to play by substantially lengthening red's shot - the following leave is able to achieve this:



A 1-back leave with a degree of polarity - red is the opponent's backward ball so its shot at blue/black has been lengthened


Red is placed very near the south boundary as a deliberately poor pioneer at H1, and the length of red's shot is increased by 5-6 yards over what it would be in a normal cross-wire.  Placing red as a deliberately poor pioneer at H1 may encourage yellow to play.  Be aware, of course, that placing balls deliberately close to the boundary should only be done if you are confident of picking up a break from those positions afterwards, particularly bearing in mind that yellow may choose to corner.
Cross-wiring summary
Advantages

Ultimate distance between the opponent's balls and yours - normally 30+ yards
Gives you an easy break with a ball at your hoop if they miss

Disadvantages

No grey area - opponent is generally compelled to shoot
Not much polarity to be had
Opponent generally has an easy break if they hit (depending on clips)

Back to top

Third Turn Leaves
Generally when referring to a third-turn leave we are referring to when a player has hit on the third turn of the game and played a break to 4-back with 3 balls, then set a leave.  Bearing in mind that the fourth ball is not yet played into the game, the opponent does not have the option of which ball to play with their fourth-turn shot - they must play the remaining ball.  As such, there are opportunities to set a leave utilising the opponent's ball in close proximity to your own.
Three Ducks Leave
This leave is probably the most popular of all the third-turn leaves after a break to 4-back.



The standard Three Ducks leave after a break to 4-back by blue


The Three Ducks is so named because the balls are arranged like "ducks in a row", near the west boundary.  The best way to arrange this leave is to have your H1 ball near/on the west boundary, with the opponent ball about 1 yard further in-court and your 4-back ball another yard further in again - assuming an opponent miss, this then enables you to set an opponent ball as the H2 pioneer and take partner ball to H1 - which in turn will be sent to H3 / 4b for potential peeling opportunities later.
The Three Ducks is the most aggressive of the third-turn leaves and doesn't really leave any defensive option for the opponent.  Having said that, if the opponent takes the longer lift shot from C1 through to C2, it can be a bit tricky to dig the C2 ball out if you do not get a forward rush out of H1.  If no forward rush is achieved, you may choose to take off to C2 instead of croquet partner ball to H3.

A perfectly valid option, but far less frequently used.  This is a mirror image of the regular Three Ducks, although it is probably a bit more difficult to pick up a break from a missed lift.  It is easier to make than the regular Three Ducks as it doesn't require control out of 3b.



A reverse Three Ducks leave


If the opponent misses the shot from C3 to C4 there is an interesting opportunity to play a bombard on the in-lawn ball to H1 while approaching the ball in C4 - certainly it is not the kind of shot you would want to approach without having practised it, but if played successfully, gives an immediate 4-ball break.  
Third-Turn NSL
This leave is just like a regular NSL but obviously with a ball missing.  Again it's best to have your 4-back ball in the NSL position at H4, so the way you go about making this leave is slightly different than a normal NSL.



A third turn NSL by blue


After making 3-back you can rush partner out to the east boundary, then rush the opponent's ball back slightly south of 3-back.  A little stop shot is then played to send the opponent ball out towards partner while approaching the intended wired spot at H4 with striker's ball.
Another method would be to rush both partner and opponent out towards their east boundary positions, and then takeoff back to place your ball in the wired spot at H4. 
The fourth turn shot from the opponent is the exact equivalent of them lifting the ball from the west boundary and taking their lift shot.
Third-Turn Defensive Spread
The third-turn leave favoured by stronger players - this looks a lot like a DSL but with the peg ball missing.



A third-turn Defensive Spread by blue


After a fourth-turn miss from the opponent, the break pickup is similar to that of a DSL, but ideally the initial rush is left for the H1 ball on the opponent's ball, and your 4-back ball is placed on or near the west boundary. This gives the advantage of taking the rush to H1 with partner. 
When making this leave, very strong players will likely play their 4-back ball all the way to the west boundary with their final shot for blue, instead of lagging the ball a yard or two from the yardline - this adds more defence to the leave, and means that if the opponent does hit the long lift their break pick-up will be even more difficult.

Super Advanced Leaves

The Super Advanced game is a slightly modified version of association croquet that is played at championship level in England.  It incorporates an additional lift (at hoop 4) when compared to normal advanced rules, and hence changes the tactics and first-break leaves quite considerably.  As a result, all the golden rules for leave-making go out the window.  A separate article about super advanced first-break tactics and leaves is available here

Leaves


Leaves
A "leave" in croquet is the culmination of the process of arranging the balls at the end of your turn.  The idea is that you keep the "innings", which normally means laying the court in an adventageous way for your partner ball, and that the opponent balls will be far apart, or at least wired from each other, with no short shots available.
What makes a good leave?

Your two balls close together with a useful rush
No shot shorter than 13 yards for the opponent, and no double target

What makes a great leave?

Your next turn is easier if the opponent misses than their turn is if they hit
No shot shorter than 17 yards for the opponent
Leaving some grey area - options available for the opponent to take a longer, more defensive shot
Polarity - influencing the opponent to play one ball over another, due to where it is positioned

Golden rules for making leaves
When all four balls are on the lawn, there are really two golden rules to leave-making that you should try to adhere to at all times.  Firstly, you should ensure that the very final ball you roquet in your turn should be your partner ball - this helps to organise a good rush for starting your next turn.  Secondly, you should try and ensure to always make your final hoop of the turn off an opponent's ball.  These two points are somewhat interrelated in that if you make your final hoop off the opponent, you will be roqueting it first after making the hoop, leaving partner ball "live" to be roqueted in a few strokes' time.

Diagonal Spread
The diagonal spread leave, or DSL for short, is probably the most commonly-attempted leave in croquet.  The reasons for this are that it is relatively easy to make, it is relatively forgiving if it goes horribly wrong, and doesn't leave any short shots from any baulk line.  It is a fairly hoop-agnostic leave, meaning that it is generally pretty easy to pick up a break from a DSL after a miss by the opponent, regardless of the hoop you are for.  In the example below, a DSL has been made after a break to 4-back by blue, with partner ball (black) for hoop 1.

As discussed in the golden rules above, the opponent ball is sent to 3-back (the final hoop of the turn).  Interestingly a good way to help achieve this is to organise earlier in the break to send partner to 2-back as an early pioneer after hoop 5 - if you send partner to 2-back then the 3-back pioneer will naturally be one of the opponent balls.
Before making 3-back you should organise the other opponent ball near the peg, fairly close to where you want its final position to be, and organise your partner ball 1-2 yards east of it to act as the escape ball. After making 3-back and croqueting the reception ball out towards the west boundary, you should try and rush the opponent ball by the peg into a wired spot immediately - the closer you can get it to the wired spot using a rush, the easier your job will be to wire it with the croquet stroke. Once the ball at the peg has been placed in the wired spot, you rush your escape ball (partner) out to the east boundary and lay a rush into the court for your partner ball, with both balls being wired from the ball at the peg, and ideally also wired from the ball near the west boundary.
Reverse DSL
A reverse diagonal spread is made in exactly the same way, but just organising the balls in a mirror-image, as in the diagram below.  Actually this can be quite a useful leave after a break to the peg when your partner ball is on 2-back, 3-back or 4-back as it makes picking up a break from any of these hoops fairly straightforward - certainly easier than a normal DSL.



A reverse DSL


The "B" Spread
If the diagonal spread is the most commonly-attempted leave, the "B" spread is probably the most commonly-completed leave.  Basically a "B" spread is a diagonal spread that has gone wrong when it comes to the wiring of the opponent balls at the peg.  Because the peg is narrow, the margins for error are fairly small.
Taking a step back, it is important to identify one of the most crucial parts of setting a DSL, and where a DSL is liable to go wrong - running 3-back.  Because of the distance between 3-back and the peg, it is quite important to get a forward rush out of 3-back to ensure that you are playing the crucial croquet stroke to place one oppo ball near the west boundary while approaching the other, from fairly close range.  It is very easy to lose control of the striker's ball when sending it more than a few yards in a croquet stroke and so any inaccuracies with the croquet stroke after 3-back stroke will compound in the placement of the ball near the peg. All too often, players will fail to get a rush out of 3-back, play a croquet stroke that leaves them a 2-yard roquet on the ball near the peg, and then roquet it so far out of position that they are unable to reliably croquet it back to the wired spot at the peg - this is by far the most common cause of the "B" spread.  If the ball near the peg is left open on the other opponent ball near the west boundary it generally results in leaving a 10-yard shot for the opponent.  



The difference between a DSL and a "B" spread - the image on the left shows red and yellow wired; the image on the right shows yellow is fully open on red


If you have gotten into a position whereby the opponent balls are left open across the peg, then it is worth considering not laying a rush for your partner, but instead wide-joining near corner 4, or in some cases even splitting up your balls completely, with one on the east boundary and the other in or near corner 2.
Do keep in mind that, although the "B" spread is a bad leave, a 10-yard shot still requires hitting, and it is a shot that is missed surprisingly frequently, even by strong players.  This is the advantage of attempting a diagonal spread - if it does go badly wrong and balls are left open, the opponent will still not have any shorter shot than around 10 yards. 
Backing out of a DSL
If your DSL is headed towards being a "B" spread then you have options to back out of it.  After making 3-back and sending an opponent ball towards the west boundary, it is at this point that you need to make a decision to continue with the DSL and risk a "B" spread or to back out and set an OSL - which we will look at further down this article.

Old Standard Leave
The Old Standard Leave, or OSL, was popular in earlier times, particularly in the 1960s.  Traditionally, the standard first-break tactic was to play your break to 4-back, peeling your partner through hoop 1 after 2-back, then after making 3-back to set an OSL (or "standard leave", as they were referred to at that time).  These days, the tactic of peeling partner through hoop 1 after 2-back is almost entirely extinct, as it is generally considered unhelpful - but the OSL is still a strong leave in its own right, whether partner is for H1 or H2.  The leave is very simple to make and leaves a 13-yard shot for the opponent ball at your balls in C4 from A Baulk.  There is no defensive option shot for the opponent to consider and they will have a fairly simple break pickup if they hit.

New Standard Leave
A new leave became popular in the 1990s in favour of the OSL, and is somewhat originally named the "New Standard Leave".  This leave is still one of the most popular leaves done today at the end of a break to 4-back.

There are 2 popular methods of making this leave:

With partner at 2-back - make 1-back off an opponent ball and place it near the west boundary after the hoop, then rush the other opponent ball down the court, loading it to 3-back as a pioneer; make 2-back off partner ball and get a rush to 3-back where the other opponent ball is waiting
With opponent at 2-back - make 2-back and croquet the opponent towards the west boundary while gaining a rush on partner towards 3-back where the other opponent ball is waiting

The first method has the advantage of giving good control over the placement of the west boundary ball whereas the second method has the advantage of not requiring an easterly rush out of 2-back.  Whichever method you choose, it is imperative that the 3-back pioneer is the opponent ball, because after making 3-back, the reception ball will need to be left in a very specific spot a few inches north-east of the hoop.
Placement of ball at H4
The trickiest part of setting the NSL is getting the ball at H4 accurately placed - you need to place it close enough to H4 that the ball will not have a backswing to shoot at your two balls on the east boundary.  You must also ensure that none of the ball is visible from A Baulk - even if an edge is visible it is sometimes possible for the opponent to shoot from A Baulk at a pseudo-double target with the edge of the ball at H4 and one of your balls in the background on the east boundary.  Finally, the ball must not be positioned in such a way that it does not rush to H1
In order to place the ball in the best spot, it is quite important that the approach is played from close-by and slightly south-east of the hoop. The hoop approach should ideally place the opponent ball just north of the ideal wired spot so that the hoop can be run past the reception ball and then roquet it back onto the perfect wired line - see the animation below:



Tap on the image to play the animation.


In the animation above, the grey circle indicates the ideal wired spot for red and the diagonal lines show the area which is wired from A Baulk.  It is perfectly reasonable to try and place the opponent ball in the ideal spot with the hoop approach - doing so will mean that you don't need to roquet it at all after the hoop and can instead just roquet black, leaving red where it is; but beware that trying to place red ideally in the hoop approach and leaving it short will make correcting the wiring more difficult - any roquet on a short red will only be sending it further away from the ideal spot.
Polarity
Unlike the diagonal spread, there is a certain amount of polarity in a NSL, meaning that you can influence the opponent's decision of which ball to play (or at least gain an easier break if they miss with the ball that they want to play) based on whether you place their backward or forward ball at H4 after 3-back.  This is more of an important decision in a game between stronger players who are capable of TP'ing, and also particularly in doubles this can be a critical tactical choice - for example if one of the opponents is a much weaker shot than the other, you would probably want to influence them to take the lift.
If the opponent chooses to lift their ball from H4 and take the "long" lift and misses from C3 to C4, then it is quite difficult for you to dig that ball out of C4 and into your break until you are for H4 yourself; on the other hand if the opponent lifts their ball from the west boundary and shoots from C3 to C4, it gives you the opportunity to establish a 4-ball break before you've even made H1 - you can do this by roqueting partner with your first shot, taking off to the C4 ball and playing a drive from C4, sending a pioneer to H2 while gaining a rush to H1 on the ball near H4.
Now consider that the opponent's clips are on penult and peg for example - it is highly likely in this scenario that the opponent will play their penult ball regardless of the ball positions.  Bearing this in mind, if you place the opponent's penult ball near the west boundary and their peg ball at H4, any missed lift with the penult ball will give you a greater chance at a 4-ball break and a possible TP.
A counter argument on the above scenario may be this: if the opponent (peg and penult) is bound to play their penult ball regardless of the ball positions, placing their penult ball on the west boundary may influence them to take the shorter lift shot from A Baulk instead of the longer shot from B Baulk, as they may correctly decide that missing any shot with their penult ball will give you a 4-ball break before H1.  Consider, instead, that placing the balls the "wrong" way round (peg ball on west boundary; penult ball at H4) and you may find your opponent will ultimately decide to take a longer shot with the penult ball than they may otherwise have done.  There is a balance of probabilities to be made between your expectation of the opponent hitting the long shot vs the short shot, and your reduced chances of making a game-winning break if they miss a more defensive shot into C4.

Advantages

Polarity - can influence opponent to play one ball or the other

Disadvantages

More tricky to make than a DSL
Easy to leave a double target from A Baulk if the ball at H4 is not perfectly placed

MSL (Maugham Standard Leave)
This is a variation on the NSL and was popularised by David Maugham, a leading player in the UK.  Compared to the NSL, instead of leaving a ball floating near the west boundary, after running 1-back under control you will croquet one of the opponent balls onto the middle of the west upright of H2.  In this position it cannot be rushed to H1 but acts as a perfect pioneer for H2.  As the ball at H2 is not rushable to H1, the rush is left for your partner ball to H1.



A MSL after a break by blue


This leave is more difficult to make than a NSL as it requires very good control of your break, particularly around 1-back, but there is a strong case to be made for it.  Assuming all the other clips are for H1, if the opponent lifts the ball from H4 and hits one of your balls down the east boundary from C3, then they will need to get a rush to H1 immediately.  Unless they just managed to snick the lift shot, then they are probably going to be faced with a long and difficult croquet stroke in order to obtain the rush to H1 on your other ball.
Placement of the ball at H2 after 1-back
The exact placement of the opponent ball onto the wire of H2 after running 1-back is shown in the animation below - tap on it to play.



Tap on the image to play the animation.


Blue makes 1-back off yellow with red as the escape ball for the southwards rush; partner (black) is the pioneer at 2-back.  When placing the ball on the wire of H2 after 1-back, you should endeavour to arrange the balls so that the placement is done from close range and can be done with a straight, gentle stop shot; playing this shot with any amount of split will mean that both the pace and the line will be much harder to judge.  Because you want to place the ball using a small straight stop shot, you should give some thought to the placement of the escape ball so that you will automatically gain a rush down the court on it without having to do anything with the striker's ball. 
Another advantage is that if the opponent lifts the ball from H4 and misses the long lift, you will be making H1 off partner (which is always comforting) and will have a perfect H2 pioneer.  This will pretty much guarantee that you are approaching H2 from a matter of inches away, and you can even look to get a dolly rush out of H2 towards C4 to develop the C4 ball before you have made H3.  Additionally, if you are looking at TPs, then having made H1 off partner, it will naturally be sent to H3 / 4b as a pioneer and potential peeling opportunity.
MSL summary
Advantages

Polarity - can influence opponent to play one ball or the other
You start next break by making H1 off partner
Probably the best leave for developing a standard triple opportunity
Potentially difficult break pickup for the opponent

Disadvantages

More tricky to make than a NSL or DSL
Rush to H1 from east boundary is slightly more difficult and is unlikely to be a dolly rush

Bryant Leave
This leave is named after NZ player Greg Bryant, who first started performing it regularly in 1993.  It is really the ultimate in aggressive leaves and is very difficult to make.  One ball is placed in the NSL position at H4, and the other is placed ideally about 1cm directly north of H1, or alternatively against the inside of one of the uprights, on the northern side.  Placement of this ball is difficult to get right and it is very important that none of the ball is showing through H1 on the southern side where it may be easy to hit from A Baulk.  



A Bryant Leave by blue


If you are preparing to make a Bryant Leave, then you must have an opponent ball as your 2-back pioneer.  Having a very close pioneer is important here, and you may consider placing it at 2-back from close range after H5 - ideally the pioneer will be 12 inches or less from 2-back. You should also have the other opponent ball at 1-back as the pioneer, which will naturally be sent out afterwards as the 3-back pioneer
Placement of the opponent ball at H1
This is the crucial part of the Bryant leave.  After making 1-back and loading the opponent ball to 3-back, you need a good rush on the pivot ball towards 2-back.  The pivot should then be placed around 1 yard east and 1 foot north of 2-back as an escape ball before you make 2-back off the opponent ball.



Tap on the image to play the animation.


After 2-back, roquet the opponent reception ball back in front of 2-back as close as possible and then place it into the required position with a delicate stop shot.  After that, you can roquet your escape ball (partner) towards 3-back and make the hoop off the other opponent ball, setting it in the NSL position afterwards.
Bryant Leave summary
Advantages

Opponent has no defensive shot so any miss will give you all the balls immediately
Artificial polarity - the opponent will still be more inclined to lift the ball from H1 despite having no safe shots
If the ball placed at H4 is for H2, it can be very tough to pick up a break after hitting the lift
Looks really cool

Disadvantages

There is no grey area - opponent has no defensive shot so may as well take the shortest shot
Difficult to make

Defensive Spread
A very good, and probably under-used, leave.  This leave is great if you are the stronger player playing against a weaker player.  While it only leaves a 13-yard lift shot, it gives very poor break prospects if the lift is hit.

The leave above is one variation of the defensive spread - a mirror image of the same leave can also be made, with blue/black laid up in C4 and one opponent ball near C2 and the other peg-high on the east boundary.
The variation where blue and black are laid up in C2 is an incredibly strong leave when red is for H3 (either by breaking down or by POPs during blue's break) and yellow is for 4-back - if red hits any lift shot whatsoever, its break  prospects are slim at best; on the other hand, a miss by red gives black strong prospects of starting a second break.  Even a more defensive miss of yellow at black gives fairly good break prospects for black.
This leave is perhaps at its best on a difficult lawn where picking up breaks is more challenging, and so you do not want to gift the opponent a break with balls in the middle of the court if they happen to hit your lift.  
Defensive Spread summary
Advantages

Very strong - if the clips are right

Polarity - the opponent has aggressive and defensive lift shot options

Vertical Spread
The vertical spread is generally thought of as a second-break leave, meaning that you would look to make this leave at the end of a break to the peg, normally when your partner has well advanced clips.  It is quite common to see players make this leave when their partner ball is for 4-back, however I would not advise doing so - it can be very difficult to finish from 4-back and peg after a miss by the opponent, and there are generally better leave options available for these clips.

The Vertical Spread is actually quite easy to make, because the opponent balls can be placed from close range after running penult and rover without having to play any difficult shots.  The exact placement of the two balls at penult and rover is also not as crucial as it is when placing a ball on the back of H1 for example, because penult and rover are further from baulk.  Still, you should aim to achieve ideal position of the two opponent balls as it will give greater flexibility when deciding where to lay your own balls up at the conclusion of the turn.  The ball at penult should be placed in the front of the jaws of H6 - it is also fine to be up against one wire or the other, so long as it is on the inside of the wire and not visible from baulk, and the ball should ideally not be showing through the hoop on the non-playing side of H6.  The position for the ball at rover is essentially the same, but mirrored.
The most obvious use case for this leave is when partner (black in this case) is for penult, as it will give you an easy finishing turn from any missed lift.  Please note the diagram above has the opponent balls laid up on the east boundary, but you can just as easily lay up on the west boundary, which may enable an easier rush to penult.
You can also think of this leave as a fairly defensive leave.  If the opponent already has an advanced clip, e.g. they are for 4-back and H1, then you should try and arrange their forward ball to be the ball left south of penult. Doing this will encourage them to lift their forward ball, however if they do decide to shoot and hit with their backward ball, their break pick-up will be very difficult indeed, because the ball left in penult cannot be rushed to either H1 or H2.
Vertical spread summary
Advantages

Relatively easy to make
Very strong break prospects for your partner ball (if the clips are right)
Very poor break prospects for the opponent ball (if the clips are right)

Disadvantages

Limited value if partner clip is not for penult (or H5)

Cross-Peg
You can think of the cross-peg leave a bit like a diagonal spread, but with the west boundary ball about 12 yards further in court than normal.  The way you go about making the cross-peg is the essentially the same as that of the DSL, but after making your final hoop of the turn, you need to get a good rush to the peg where the other two balls are waiting.



A cross-peg after a break to the peg by blue


Because the rush out of your final hoop is so crucial to getting a good cross-peg, you would not frequently see this leave after a break to 4-back - making 3-back with control and a dolly rush to the peg is relatively difficult for relatively little gain in having a cross-peg instead of a DSL.  It is much more common to set this leave after running rover when your partner is for 4-back or penult.  Running rover and obtaining a dolly rush to the peg is significantly easier than the same out of 3-back, and what's more, rover is significantly closer to the peg than 3-back is.  The benefit of a cross-peg over a DSL is also more evident when for 4-back, because at the start of your next turn you will avoid the slightly tricky cross-court rushes from the east boundary to the west boundary, and also from there to 4-back.  



Tap on the image to play the animation.


The crucial thing to remember when setting the cross-peg leave (aside from the actual wiring itself) is that you should make sure the two opponent balls are placed slightly off horizontal to each other; the westerly ball should be just north of the peg and the easterly ball just south of the peg.  If this is not achieved, then it is likely that the opponent will have a 13-yard shot from somewhere on the court.

Advantages

Easy to finish from 4-back and peg after a missed lift

Disadvantages

Cross-Wire
A cross-wiring leave is where you leave both opponent balls close together at a hoop, wired from each other.  Cross-wiring can be done at any hoop, although it is not considered a lift leave - you should only plan to cross-wire if you have not made a lift hoop during your turn, otherwise the opponent will probably have a very short shot from one of the baulk lines.



Red and yellow are cross-wired at black's hoop


There is a sequence you should try to follow when making most cross-wires, which is:

Before making your final hoop, arrange one opponent ball and partner ball at the intended cross-wiring hoop
Make your final hoop off the opponent ball and gain a rush towards the cross-wiring hoop
Wire the two opponent balls at the hoop
Rush the escape ball (partner) away to a far corner

Cross-wiring opportunities
Cross-wiring is not a lift leave, so unless you are planning on laying for sextuples, most of the opportunities to do so tend to arise more by chance.  For example, if your clips are for penult and 3-back, and you hit in with your ball for penult, you can safely make your last two hoops without conceding a lift. In the example below, blue is for penult, black for 3-back; yellow has just broken down at H6 on a break.  Click the solution button below the image to see how blue might go about playing its next turn.

As you can see, the cross-wire is an incredibly strong leave and you should always be on the lookout for opportunities to make it - it will give a very long shot to your opponent, and an easy break if they miss, putting you in a very strong game position.
The (delayed) sextuple leave (or "1-back leave")
The main reasoning for playing for sextuples at all is to avoid the conceding of a lift, and so it is here where we can take advantage of cross-wiring as a standard part of a leave.  Below is a common leave seen when laying for a sextuple, leaving red and yellow the longest possible shot on the court:

To set this leave, you follow the same pattern outlined further above.  Before making hoop 6 (the final hoop of your turn), you should arrange one opponent and partner ball at hoop 1 (the cross-wiring hoop).  Make H6 with a rush back to H1 and cross-wire the opponent balls across the hoop, preferably diagonally, and gain a rush on partner ball towards C3.
The standard sextuple leave
Despite the name, this sextuple leave is rarely seen, both because it is much harder to get right, and also leaves a significantly shorter shot for the opponent.  The benefits of this leave as far as the sextuple goes is that it makes the sextuple turn a great deal easier, essentially nothing more than a quadruple peel. The standard sextuple leave is as follows:

Close





As you can see, when setting this leave, you actually complete the cross-wiring after H5, then rush partner to H6 to score that hoop, afterwards gaining a rush to 1-back.  The reason this method is favoured for this particular leave is so that you can be rushing to 1-back from close range (near H6) instead of from near 2-back as you would have to do when performing the cross-wire after H6. Rushing to 1-back from close range helps you to obtain a good position for the jawsing of your ball in 1-back.
Polarity in cross-wiring leaves
In reality, leaving both opponent balls together (albeit wired from each other) means that there is little-to-no polarity to be had; however, there are some things you can do to still encourage one ball to play over the other.  Imagine that blue has cross-wired red and yellow at H1  (black's hoop).  Red is for 4-back and yellow is for peg, and as such, the striker of blue and black would want to  encourage yellow to play by substantially lengthening red's shot - the following leave is able to achieve this:



A 1-back leave with a degree of polarity - red is the opponent's backward ball so its shot at blue/black has been lengthened


Red is placed very near the south boundary as a deliberately poor pioneer at H1, and the length of red's shot is increased by 5-6 yards over what it would be in a normal cross-wire.  Placing red as a deliberately poor pioneer at H1 may encourage yellow to play.  Be aware, of course, that placing balls deliberately close to the boundary should only be done if you are confident of picking up a break from those positions afterwards, particularly bearing in mind that yellow may choose to corner.
Cross-wiring summary
Advantages

Ultimate distance between the opponent's balls and yours - normally 30+ yards
Gives you an easy break with a ball at your hoop if they miss

Disadvantages

No grey area - opponent is generally compelled to shoot
Not much polarity to be had
Opponent generally has an easy break if they hit (depending on clips)

Third Turn Leaves
Generally when referring to a third-turn leave we are referring to when a player has hit on the third turn of the game and played a break to 4-back with 3 balls, then set a leave.  Bearing in mind that the fourth ball is not yet played into the game, the opponent does not have the option of which ball to play with their fourth-turn shot - they must play the remaining ball.  As such, there are opportunities to set a leave utilising the opponent's ball in close proximity to your own.
Three Ducks Leave
This leave is probably the most popular of all the third-turn leaves after a break to 4-back.



The standard Three Ducks leave after a break to 4-back by blue


The Three Ducks is so named because the balls are arranged like "ducks in a row", near the west boundary.  The best way to arrange this leave is to have your H1 ball near/on the west boundary, with the opponent ball about 1 yard further in-court and your 4-back ball another yard further in again - assuming an opponent miss, this then enables you to set an opponent ball as the H2 pioneer and take partner ball to H1 - which in turn will be sent to H3 / 4b for potential peeling opportunities later.
The Three Ducks is the most aggressive of the third-turn leaves and doesn't really leave any defensive option for the opponent.  Having said that, if the opponent takes the longer lift shot from C1 through to C2, it can be a bit tricky to dig the C2 ball out if you do not get a forward rush out of H1.  If no forward rush is achieved, you may choose to take off to C2 instead of croquet partner ball to H3.
Reverse Three Ducks Leave
A perfectly valid option, but far less frequently used.  This is a mirror image of the regular Three Ducks, although it is probably a bit more difficult to pick up a break from a missed lift.  It is easier to make than the regular Three Ducks as it doesn't require control out of 3b.



A reverse Three Ducks leave


If the opponent misses the shot from C3 to C4 there is an interesting opportunity to play a bombard on the in-lawn ball to H1 while approaching the ball in C4 - certainly it is not the kind of shot you would want to approach without having practised it, but if played successfully, gives an immediate 4-ball break.  
Third-Turn NSL
This leave is just like a regular NSL but obviously with a ball missing.  Again it's best to have your 4-back ball in the NSL position at H4, so the way you go about making this leave is slightly different than a normal NSL.



A third turn NSL by blue


After making 3-back you can rush partner out to the east boundary, then rush the opponent's ball back slightly south of 3-back.  A little stop shot is then played to send the opponent ball out towards partner while approaching the intended wired spot at H4 with striker's ball.
Another method would be to rush both partner and opponent out towards their east boundary positions, and then takeoff back to place your ball in the wired spot at H4. 
The fourth turn shot from the opponent is the exact equivalent of them lifting the ball from the west boundary and taking their lift shot.
Third-Turn Defensive Spread
The third-turn leave favoured by stronger players - this looks a lot like a DSL but with the peg ball missing.



A third-turn Defensive Spread by blue


After a fourth-turn miss from the opponent, the break pickup is similar to that of a DSL, but ideally the initial rush is left for the H1 ball on the opponent's ball, and your 4-back ball is placed on or near the west boundary. This gives the advantage of taking the rush to H1 with partner. 
When making this leave, very strong players will likely play their 4-back ball all the way to the west boundary with their final shot for blue, instead of lagging the ball a yard or two from the yardline - this adds more defence to the leave, and means that if the opponent does hit the long lift their break pick-up will be even more difficult.

Super Advanced Leaves

The Super Advanced game is a slightly modified version of association croquet that is played at championship level in England.  It incorporates an additional lift (at hoop 4) when compared to normal advanced rules, and hence changes the tactics and first-break leaves quite considerably.  As a result, all the golden rules for leave-making go out the window.  A separate article about super advanced first-break tactics and leaves is available here

Leaves


Leaves
A "leave" in croquet is the culmination of the process of arranging the balls at the end of your turn.  The idea is that you keep the "innings", which normally means laying the court in an adventageous way for your partner ball, and that the opponent balls will be far apart, or at least wired from each other, with no short shots available.
What makes a good leave?

Your two balls close together with a useful rush
No shot shorter than 13 yards for the opponent, and no double target

What makes a great leave?

Your next turn is easier if the opponent misses than their turn is if they hit
No shot shorter than 17 yards for the opponent
Leaving some grey area - options available for the opponent to take a longer, more defensive shot
Polarity - influencing the opponent to play one ball over another, due to where it is positioned

Golden rules for making leaves
When all four balls are on the lawn, there are really two golden rules to leave-making that you should try to adhere to at all times.  Firstly, you should ensure that the very final ball you roquet in your turn should be your partner ball - this helps to organise a good rush for starting your next turn.  Secondly, you should try and ensure to always make your final hoop of the turn off an opponent's ball.  These two points are somewhat interrelated in that if you make your final hoop off the opponent, you will be roqueting it first after making the hoop, leaving partner ball "live" to be roqueted in a few strokes' time.

Diagonal Spread
The diagonal spread leave, or DSL for short, is probably the most commonly-attempted leave in croquet.  The reasons for this are that it is relatively easy to make, it is relatively forgiving if it goes horribly wrong, and doesn't leave any short shots from any baulk line.  It is a fairly hoop-agnostic leave, meaning that it is generally pretty easy to pick up a break from a DSL after a miss by the opponent, regardless of the hoop you are for.  In the example below, a DSL has been made after a break to 4-back by blue, with partner ball (black) for hoop 1.

As discussed in the golden rules above, the opponent ball is sent to 3-back (the final hoop of the turn).  Interestingly a good way to help achieve this is to organise earlier in the break to send partner to 2-back as an early pioneer after hoop 5 - if you send partner to 2-back then the 3-back pioneer will naturally be one of the opponent balls.
Before making 3-back you should organise the other opponent ball near the peg, fairly close to where you want its final position to be, and organise your partner ball 1-2 yards east of it to act as the escape ball. After making 3-back and croqueting the reception ball out towards the west boundary, you should try and rush the opponent ball by the peg into a wired spot immediately - the closer you can get it to the wired spot using a rush, the easier your job will be to wire it with the croquet stroke. Once the ball at the peg has been placed in the wired spot, you rush your escape ball (partner) out to the east boundary and lay a rush into the court for your partner ball, with both balls being wired from the ball at the peg, and ideally also wired from the ball near the west boundary.
Reverse DSL
A reverse diagonal spread is made in exactly the same way, but just organising the balls in a mirror-image, as in the diagram below.  Actually this can be quite a useful leave after a break to the peg when your partner ball is on 2-back, 3-back or 4-back as it makes picking up a break from any of these hoops fairly straightforward - certainly easier than a normal DSL.



A reverse DSL


The "B" Spread
If the diagonal spread is the most commonly-attempted leave, the "B" spread is probably the most commonly-completed leave.  Basically a "B" spread is a diagonal spread that has gone wrong when it comes to the wiring of the opponent balls at the peg.  Because the peg is narrow, the margins for error are fairly small.
Taking a step back, it is important to identify one of the most crucial parts of setting a DSL, and where a DSL is liable to go wrong - running 3-back.  Because of the distance between 3-back and the peg, it is quite important to get a forward rush out of 3-back to ensure that you are playing the crucial croquet stroke to place one oppo ball near the west boundary while approaching the other, from fairly close range.  It is very easy to lose control of the striker's ball when sending it more than a few yards in a croquet stroke and so any inaccuracies with the croquet stroke after 3-back stroke will compound in the placement of the ball near the peg. All too often, players will fail to get a rush out of 3-back, play a croquet stroke that leaves them a 2-yard roquet on the ball near the peg, and then roquet it so far out of position that they are unable to reliably croquet it back to the wired spot at the peg - this is by far the most common cause of the "B" spread.  If the ball near the peg is left open on the other opponent ball near the west boundary it generally results in leaving a 10-yard shot for the opponent.  



The difference between a DSL and a "B" spread - the image on the left shows red and yellow wired; the image on the right shows yellow is fully open on red


If you have gotten into a position whereby the opponent balls are left open across the peg, then it is worth considering not laying a rush for your partner, but instead wide-joining near corner 4, or in some cases even splitting up your balls completely, with one on the east boundary and the other in or near corner 2.
Do keep in mind that, although the "B" spread is a bad leave, a 10-yard shot still requires hitting, and it is a shot that is missed surprisingly frequently, even by strong players.  This is the advantage of attempting a diagonal spread - if it does go badly wrong and balls are left open, the opponent will still not have any shorter shot than around 10 yards. 
Backing out of a DSL
If your DSL is headed towards being a "B" spread then you have options to back out of it.  After making 3-back and sending an opponent ball towards the west boundary, it is at this point that you need to make a decision to continue with the DSL and risk a "B" spread or to back out and set an OSL - which we will look at further down this article.

Advantages

Easy to make

Old Standard Leave
The Old Standard Leave, or OSL, was popular in earlier times, particularly in the 1960s.  Traditionally, the standard first-break tactic was to play your break to 4-back, peeling your partner through hoop 1 after 2-back, then after making 3-back to set an OSL (or "standard leave", as they were referred to at that time).  These days, the tactic of peeling partner through hoop 1 after 2-back is almost entirely extinct, as it is generally considered unhelpful - but the OSL is still a strong leave in its own right, whether partner is for H1 or H2.  The leave is very simple to make and leaves a 13-yard shot for the opponent ball at your balls in C4 from A Baulk.  There is no defensive option shot for the opponent to consider and they will have a fairly simple break pickup if they hit.

New Standard Leave
A new leave became popular in the 1990s in favour of the OSL, and is somewhat originally named the "New Standard Leave".  This leave is still one of the most popular leaves done today at the end of a break to 4-back.

There are 2 popular methods of making this leave:

With partner at 2-back - make 1-back off an opponent ball and place it near the west boundary after the hoop, then rush the other opponent ball down the court, loading it to 3-back as a pioneer; make 2-back off partner ball and get a rush to 3-back where the other opponent ball is waiting
With opponent at 2-back - make 2-back and croquet the opponent towards the west boundary while gaining a rush on partner towards 3-back where the other opponent ball is waiting

The first method has the advantage of giving good control over the placement of the west boundary ball whereas the second method has the advantage of not requiring an easterly rush out of 2-back.  Whichever method you choose, it is imperative that the 3-back pioneer is the opponent ball, because after making 3-back, the reception ball will need to be left in a very specific spot a few inches north-east of the hoop.
Placement of ball at H4
The trickiest part of setting the NSL is getting the ball at H4 accurately placed - you need to place it close enough to H4 that the ball will not have a backswing to shoot at your two balls on the east boundary.  You must also ensure that none of the ball is visible from A Baulk - even if an edge is visible it is sometimes possible for the opponent to shoot from A Baulk at a pseudo-double target with the edge of the ball at H4 and one of your balls in the background on the east boundary.  Finally, the ball must not be positioned in such a way that it does not rush to H1
In order to place the ball in the best spot, it is quite important that the approach is played from close-by and slightly south-east of the hoop. The hoop approach should ideally place the opponent ball just north of the ideal wired spot so that the hoop can be run past the reception ball and then roquet it back onto the perfect wired line - see the animation below:



Tap on the image to play the animation.


In the animation above, the grey circle indicates the ideal wired spot for red and the diagonal lines show the area which is wired from A Baulk.  It is perfectly reasonable to try and place the opponent ball in the ideal spot with the hoop approach - doing so will mean that you don't need to roquet it at all after the hoop and can instead just roquet black, leaving red where it is; but beware that trying to place red ideally in the hoop approach and leaving it short will make correcting the wiring more difficult - any roquet on a short red will only be sending it further away from the ideal spot.
Polarity
Unlike the diagonal spread, there is a certain amount of polarity in a NSL, meaning that you can influence the opponent's decision of which ball to play (or at least gain an easier break if they miss with the ball that they want to play) based on whether you place their backward or forward ball at H4 after 3-back.  This is more of an important decision in a game between stronger players who are capable of TP'ing, and also particularly in doubles this can be a critical tactical choice - for example if one of the opponents is a much weaker shot than the other, you would probably want to influence them to take the lift.
If the opponent chooses to lift their ball from H4 and take the "long" lift and misses from C3 to C4, then it is quite difficult for you to dig that ball out of C4 and into your break until you are for H4 yourself; on the other hand if the opponent lifts their ball from the west boundary and shoots from C3 to C4, it gives you the opportunity to establish a 4-ball break before you've even made H1 - you can do this by roqueting partner with your first shot, taking off to the C4 ball and playing a drive from C4, sending a pioneer to H2 while gaining a rush to H1 on the ball near H4.
Now consider that the opponent's clips are on penult and peg for example - it is highly likely in this scenario that the opponent will play their penult ball regardless of the ball positions.  Bearing this in mind, if you place the opponent's penult ball near the west boundary and their peg ball at H4, any missed lift with the penult ball will give you a greater chance at a 4-ball break and a possible TP.
A counter argument on the above scenario may be this: if the opponent (peg and penult) is bound to play their penult ball regardless of the ball positions, placing their penult ball on the west boundary may influence them to take the shorter lift shot from A Baulk instead of the longer shot from B Baulk, as they may correctly decide that missing any shot with their penult ball will give you a 4-ball break before H1.  Consider, instead, that placing the balls the "wrong" way round (peg ball on west boundary; penult ball at H4) and you may find your opponent will ultimately decide to take a longer shot with the penult ball than they may otherwise have done.  There is a balance of probabilities to be made between your expectation of the opponent hitting the long shot vs the short shot, and your reduced chances of making a game-winning break if they miss a more defensive shot into C4.

Advantages

Polarity - can influence opponent to play one ball or the other

Disadvantages

More tricky to make than a DSL
Easy to leave a double target from A Baulk if the ball at H4 is not perfectly placed

MSL (Maugham Standard Leave)
This is a variation on the NSL and was popularised by David Maugham, a leading player in the UK.  Compared to the NSL, instead of leaving a ball floating near the west boundary, after running 1-back under control you will croquet one of the opponent balls onto the middle of the west upright of H2.  In this position it cannot be rushed to H1 but acts as a perfect pioneer for H2.  As the ball at H2 is not rushable to H1, the rush is left for your partner ball to H1.



A MSL after a break by blue


This leave is more difficult to make than a NSL as it requires very good control of your break, particularly around 1-back, but there is a strong case to be made for it.  Assuming all the other clips are for H1, if the opponent lifts the ball from H4 and hits one of your balls down the east boundary from C3, then they will need to get a rush to H1 immediately.  Unless they just managed to snick the lift shot, then they are probably going to be faced with a long and difficult croquet stroke in order to obtain the rush to H1 on your other ball.
Placement of the ball at H2 after 1-back
The exact placement of the opponent ball onto the wire of H2 after running 1-back is shown in the animation below - tap on it to play.



Tap on the image to play the animation.


Blue makes 1-back off yellow with red as the escape ball for the southwards rush; partner (black) is the pioneer at 2-back.  When placing the ball on the wire of H2 after 1-back, you should endeavour to arrange the balls so that the placement is done from close range and can be done with a straight, gentle stop shot; playing this shot with any amount of split will mean that both the pace and the line will be much harder to judge.  Because you want to place the ball using a small straight stop shot, you should give some thought to the placement of the escape ball so that you will automatically gain a rush down the court on it without having to do anything with the striker's ball. 
Another advantage is that if the opponent lifts the ball from H4 and misses the long lift, you will be making H1 off partner (which is always comforting) and will have a perfect H2 pioneer.  This will pretty much guarantee that you are approaching H2 from a matter of inches away, and you can even look to get a dolly rush out of H2 towards C4 to develop the C4 ball before you have made H3.  Additionally, if you are looking at TPs, then having made H1 off partner, it will naturally be sent to H3 / 4b as a pioneer and potential peeling opportunity.
MSL summary
Advantages

Polarity - can influence opponent to play one ball or the other
You start next break by making H1 off partner
Probably the best leave for developing a standard triple opportunity
Potentially difficult break pickup for the opponent

Disadvantages

More tricky to make than a NSL or DSL
Rush to H1 from east boundary is slightly more difficult and is unlikely to be a dolly rush

Bryant Leave
This leave is named after NZ player Greg Bryant, who first started performing it regularly in 1993.  It is really the ultimate in aggressive leaves and is very difficult to make.  One ball is placed in the NSL position at H4, and the other is placed ideally about 1cm directly north of H1, or alternatively against the inside of one of the uprights, on the northern side.  Placement of this ball is difficult to get right and it is very important that none of the ball is showing through H1 on the southern side where it may be easy to hit from A Baulk.  



A Bryant Leave by blue


If you are preparing to make a Bryant Leave, then you must have an opponent ball as your 2-back pioneer.  Having a very close pioneer is important here, and you may consider placing it at 2-back from close range after H5 - ideally the pioneer will be 12 inches or less from 2-back. You should also have the other opponent ball at 1-back as the pioneer, which will naturally be sent out afterwards as the 3-back pioneer
Placement of the opponent ball at H1
This is the crucial part of the Bryant leave.  After making 1-back and loading the opponent ball to 3-back, you need a good rush on the pivot ball towards 2-back.  The pivot should then be placed around 1 yard east and 1 foot north of 2-back as an escape ball before you make 2-back off the opponent ball.



Tap on the image to play the animation.


After 2-back, roquet the opponent reception ball back in front of 2-back as close as possible and then place it into the required position with a delicate stop shot.  After that, you can roquet your escape ball (partner) towards 3-back and make the hoop off the other opponent ball, setting it in the NSL position afterwards.
Bryant Leave summary
Advantages

Opponent has no defensive shot so any miss will give you all the balls immediately
Artificial polarity - the opponent will still be more inclined to lift the ball from H1 despite having no safe shots
If the ball placed at H4 is for H2, it can be very tough to pick up a break after hitting the lift
Looks really cool

Disadvantages

There is no grey area - opponent has no defensive shot so may as well take the shortest shot
Difficult to make

Defensive Spread
A very good, and probably under-used, leave.  This leave is great if you are the stronger player playing against a weaker player.  While it only leaves a 13-yard lift shot, it gives very poor break prospects if the lift is hit.

The leave above is one variation of the defensive spread - a mirror image of the same leave can also be made, with blue/black laid up in C4 and one opponent ball near C2 and the other peg-high on the east boundary.
The variation where blue and black are laid up in C2 is an incredibly strong leave when red is for H3 (either by breaking down or by POPs during blue's break) and yellow is for 4-back - if red hits any lift shot whatsoever, its break  prospects are slim at best; on the other hand, a miss by red gives black strong prospects of starting a second break.  Even a more defensive miss of yellow at black gives fairly good break prospects for black.
This leave is perhaps at its best on a difficult lawn where picking up breaks is more challenging, and so you do not want to gift the opponent a break with balls in the middle of the court if they happen to hit your lift.  
Defensive Spread summary
Advantages

Very strong - if the clips are right

Polarity - the opponent has aggressive and defensive lift shot options

Vertical Spread
The vertical spread is generally thought of as a second-break leave, meaning that you would look to make this leave at the end of a break to the peg, normally when your partner has well advanced clips.  It is quite common to see players make this leave when their partner ball is for 4-back, however I would not advise doing so - it can be very difficult to finish from 4-back and peg after a miss by the opponent, and there are generally better leave options available for these clips.

The Vertical Spread is actually quite easy to make, because the opponent balls can be placed from close range after running penult and rover without having to play any difficult shots.  The exact placement of the two balls at penult and rover is also not as crucial as it is when placing a ball on the back of H1 for example, because penult and rover are further from baulk.  Still, you should aim to achieve ideal position of the two opponent balls as it will give greater flexibility when deciding where to lay your own balls up at the conclusion of the turn.  The ball at penult should be placed in the front of the jaws of H6 - it is also fine to be up against one wire or the other, so long as it is on the inside of the wire and not visible from baulk, and the ball should ideally not be showing through the hoop on the non-playing side of H6.  The position for the ball at rover is essentially the same, but mirrored.
The most obvious use case for this leave is when partner (black in this case) is for penult, as it will give you an easy finishing turn from any missed lift.  Please note the diagram above has the opponent balls laid up on the east boundary, but you can just as easily lay up on the west boundary, which may enable an easier rush to penult.
You can also think of this leave as a fairly defensive leave.  If the opponent already has an advanced clip, e.g. they are for 4-back and H1, then you should try and arrange their forward ball to be the ball left south of penult. Doing this will encourage them to lift their forward ball, however if they do decide to shoot and hit with their backward ball, their break pick-up will be very difficult indeed, because the ball left in penult cannot be rushed to either H1 or H2.
Vertical spread summary
Advantages

Relatively easy to make
Very strong break prospects for your partner ball (if the clips are right)
Very poor break prospects for the opponent ball (if the clips are right)

Disadvantages

Limited value if partner clip is not for penult (or H5)

Cross-Peg
You can think of the cross-peg leave a bit like a diagonal spread, but with the west boundary ball about 12 yards further in court than normal.  The way you go about making the cross-peg is the essentially the same as that of the DSL, but after making your final hoop of the turn, you need to get a good rush to the peg where the other two balls are waiting.



A cross-peg after a break to the peg by blue


Because the rush out of your final hoop is so crucial to getting a good cross-peg, you would not frequently see this leave after a break to 4-back - making 3-back with control and a dolly rush to the peg is relatively difficult for relatively little gain in having a cross-peg instead of a DSL.  It is much more common to set this leave after running rover when your partner is for 4-back or penult.  Running rover and obtaining a dolly rush to the peg is significantly easier than the same out of 3-back, and what's more, rover is significantly closer to the peg than 3-back is.  The benefit of a cross-peg over a DSL is also more evident when for 4-back, because at the start of your next turn you will avoid the slightly tricky cross-court rushes from the east boundary to the west boundary, and also from there to 4-back.  



Tap on the image to play the animation.


The crucial thing to remember when setting the cross-peg leave (aside from the actual wiring itself) is that you should make sure the two opponent balls are placed slightly off horizontal to each other; the westerly ball should be just north of the peg and the easterly ball just south of the peg.  If this is not achieved, then it is likely that the opponent will have a 13-yard shot from somewhere on the court.

Advantages

Easy to finish from 4-back and peg after a missed lift

Disadvantages

Wiring at close range at the peg can easily go wrong

Cross-Wire
A cross-wiring leave is where you leave both opponent balls close together at a hoop, wired from each other.  Cross-wiring can be done at any hoop, although it is not considered a lift leave - you should only plan to cross-wire if you have not made a lift hoop during your turn, otherwise the opponent will probably have a very short shot from one of the baulk lines.



Red and yellow are cross-wired at black's hoop


There is a sequence you should try to follow when making most cross-wires, which is:

Before making your final hoop, arrange one opponent ball and partner ball at the intended cross-wiring hoop
Make your final hoop off the opponent ball and gain a rush towards the cross-wiring hoop
Wire the two opponent balls at the hoop
Rush the escape ball (partner) away to a far corner

Cross-wiring opportunities
Cross-wiring is not a lift leave, so unless you are planning on laying for sextuples, most of the opportunities to do so tend to arise more by chance.  For example, if your clips are for penult and 3-back, and you hit in with your ball for penult, you can safely make your last two hoops without conceding a lift. In the example below, blue is for penult, black for 3-back; yellow has just broken down at H6 on a break.  Click the solution button below the image to see how blue might go about playing its next turn.

As you can see, the cross-wire is an incredibly strong leave and you should always be on the lookout for opportunities to make it - it will give a very long shot to your opponent, and an easy break if they miss, putting you in a very strong game position.
The (delayed) sextuple leave (or "1-back leave")
The main reasoning for playing for sextuples at all is to avoid the conceding of a lift, and so it is here where we can take advantage of cross-wiring as a standard part of a leave.  Below is a common leave seen when laying for a sextuple, leaving red and yellow the longest possible shot on the court:  



A 1-back leave - red and yellow cross-wired at H1 with blue and black laid up near C3

To set this leave, you follow the same pattern outlined further above.  Before making hoop 6 (the final hoop of your turn), you should arrange one opponent and partner ball at hoop 1 (the cross-wiring hoop).  Make H6 with a rush back to H1 and cross-wire the opponent balls across the hoop, preferably diagonally, and gain a rush on partner ball towards C3.
The standard sextuple leave
Despite the name, this sextuple leave is rarely seen, both because it is much harder to get right, and also leaves a significantly shorter shot for the opponent.  The benefits of this leave as far as the sextuple goes is that it makes the sextuple turn a great deal easier, essentially nothing more than a quadruple peel. The standard sextuple leave is as follows:

As you can see, when setting this leave, you actually complete the cross-wiring after H5, then rush partner to H6 to score that hoop, afterwards gaining a rush to 1-back.  The reason this method is favoured for this particular leave is so that you can be rushing to 1-back from close range (near H6) instead of from near 2-back as you would have to do when performing the cross-wire after H6. Rushing to 1-back from close range helps you to obtain a good position for the jawsing of your ball in 1-back.
Polarity in cross-wiring leaves
In reality, leaving both opponent balls together (albeit wired from each other) means that there is little-to-no polarity to be had; however, there are some things you can do to still encourage one ball to play over the other.  Imagine that blue has cross-wired red and yellow at H1  (black's hoop).  Red is for 4-back and yellow is for peg, and as such, the striker of blue and black would want to  encourage yellow to play by substantially lengthening red's shot - the following leave is able to achieve this:



A 1-back leave with a degree of polarity - red is the opponent's backward ball so its shot at blue/black has been lengthened


Red is placed very near the south boundary as a deliberately poor pioneer at H1, and the length of red's shot is increased by 5-6 yards over what it would be in a normal cross-wire.  Placing red as a deliberately poor pioneer at H1 may encourage yellow to play.  Be aware, of course, that placing balls deliberately close to the boundary should only be done if you are confident of picking up a break from those positions afterwards, particularly bearing in mind that yellow may choose to corner.
Cross-wiring summary
Advantages

Ultimate distance between the opponent's balls and yours - normally 30+ yards
Gives you an easy break with a ball at your hoop if they miss

Disadvantages

No grey area - opponent is generally compelled to shoot
Not much polarity to be had
Opponent generally has an easy break if they hit (depending on clips)

Third Turn Leaves
Generally when referring to a third-turn leave we are referring to when a player has hit on the third turn of the game and played a break to 4-back with 3 balls, then set a leave.  Bearing in mind that the fourth ball is not yet played into the game, the opponent does not have the option of which ball to play with their fourth-turn shot - they must play the remaining ball.  As such, there are opportunities to set a leave utilising the opponent's ball in close proximity to your own.
Three Ducks Leave
This leave is probably the most popular of all the third-turn leaves after a break to 4-back.



The standard Three Ducks leave after a break to 4-back by blue


The Three Ducks is so named because the balls are arranged like "ducks in a row", near the west boundary.  The best way to arrange this leave is to have your H1 ball near/on the west boundary, with the opponent ball about 1 yard further in-court and your 4-back ball another yard further in again - assuming an opponent miss, this then enables you to set an opponent ball as the H2 pioneer and take partner ball to H1 - which in turn will be sent to H3 / 4b for potential peeling opportunities later.
The Three Ducks is the most aggressive of the third-turn leaves and doesn't really leave any defensive option for the opponent.  Having said that, if the opponent takes the longer lift shot from C1 through to C2, it can be a bit tricky to dig the C2 ball out if you do not get a forward rush out of H1.  If no forward rush is achieved, you may choose to take off to C2 instead of croquet partner ball to H3.
Reverse Three Ducks Leave
A perfectly valid option, but far less frequently used.  This is a mirror image of the regular Three Ducks, although it is probably a bit more difficult to pick up a break from a missed lift.  It is easier to make than the regular Three Ducks as it doesn't require control out of 3b.



A reverse Three Ducks leave


If the opponent misses the shot from C3 to C4 there is an interesting opportunity to play a bombard on the in-lawn ball to H1 while approaching the ball in C4 - certainly it is not the kind of shot you would want to approach without having practised it, but if played successfully, gives an immediate 4-ball break.  
Third-Turn NSL
This leave is just like a regular NSL but obviously with a ball missing.  Again it's best to have your 4-back ball in the NSL position at H4, so the way you go about making this leave is slightly different than a normal NSL.



A third turn NSL by blue


After making 3-back you can rush partner out to the east boundary, then rush the opponent's ball back slightly south of 3-back.  A little stop shot is then played to send the opponent ball out towards partner while approaching the intended wired spot at H4 with striker's ball.
Another method would be to rush both partner and opponent out towards their east boundary positions, and then takeoff back to place your ball in the wired spot at H4. 
The fourth turn shot from the opponent is the exact equivalent of them lifting the ball from the west boundary and taking their lift shot.
Third-Turn Defensive Spread
The third-turn leave favoured by stronger players - this looks a lot like a DSL but with the peg ball missing.



A third-turn Defensive Spread by blue


After a fourth-turn miss from the opponent, the break pickup is similar to that of a DSL, but ideally the initial rush is left for the H1 ball on the opponent's ball, and your 4-back ball is placed on or near the west boundary. This gives the advantage of taking the rush to H1 with partner. 
When making this leave, very strong players will likely play their 4-back ball all the way to the west boundary with their final shot for blue, instead of lagging the ball a yard or two from the yardline - this adds more defence to the leave, and means that if the opponent does hit the long lift their break pick-up will be even more difficult.

Super Advanced Leaves

The Super Advanced game is a slightly modified version of association croquet that is played at championship level in England.  It incorporates an additional lift (at hoop 4) when compared to normal advanced rules, and hence changes the tactics and first-break leaves quite considerably.  As a result, all the golden rules for leave-making go out the window.  A separate article about super advanced first-break tactics and leaves is available here

Leaves


Leaves
A "leave" in croquet is the culmination of the process of arranging the balls at the end of your turn.  The idea is that you keep the "innings", which normally means laying the court in an adventageous way for your partner ball, and that the opponent balls will be far apart, or at least wired from each other, with no short shots available.
What makes a good leave?

Your two balls close together with a useful rush
No shot shorter than 13 yards for the opponent, and no double target

What makes a great leave?

Your next turn is easier if the opponent misses than their turn is if they hit
No shot shorter than 17 yards for the opponent
Leaving some grey area - options available for the opponent to take a longer, more defensive shot
Polarity - influencing the opponent to play one ball over another, due to where it is positioned

Golden rules for making leaves
When all four balls are on the lawn, there are really two golden rules to leave-making that you should try to adhere to at all times.  Firstly, you should ensure that the very final ball you roquet in your turn should be your partner ball - this helps to organise a good rush for starting your next turn.  Secondly, you should try and ensure to always make your final hoop of the turn off an opponent's ball.  These two points are somewhat interrelated in that if you make your final hoop off the opponent, you will be roqueting it first after making the hoop, leaving partner ball "live" to be roqueted in a few strokes' time.

Diagonal Spread
The diagonal spread leave, or DSL for short, is probably the most commonly-attempted leave in croquet.  The reasons for this are that it is relatively easy to make, it is relatively forgiving if it goes horribly wrong, and doesn't leave any short shots from any baulk line.  It is a fairly hoop-agnostic leave, meaning that it is generally pretty easy to pick up a break from a DSL after a miss by the opponent, regardless of the hoop you are for.  In the example below, a DSL has been made after a break to 4-back by blue, with partner ball (black) for hoop 1.

As discussed in the golden rules above, the opponent ball is sent to 3-back (the final hoop of the turn).  Interestingly a good way to help achieve this is to organise earlier in the break to send partner to 2-back as an early pioneer after hoop 5 - if you send partner to 2-back then the 3-back pioneer will naturally be one of the opponent balls.
Before making 3-back you should organise the other opponent ball near the peg, fairly close to where you want its final position to be, and organise your partner ball 1-2 yards east of it to act as the escape ball. After making 3-back and croqueting the reception ball out towards the west boundary, you should try and rush the opponent ball by the peg into a wired spot immediately - the closer you can get it to the wired spot using a rush, the easier your job will be to wire it with the croquet stroke. Once the ball at the peg has been placed in the wired spot, you rush your escape ball (partner) out to the east boundary and lay a rush into the court for your partner ball, with both balls being wired from the ball at the peg, and ideally also wired from the ball near the west boundary.
Reverse DSL
A reverse diagonal spread is made in exactly the same way, but just organising the balls in a mirror-image, as in the diagram below.  Actually this can be quite a useful leave after a break to the peg when your partner ball is on 2-back, 3-back or 4-back as it makes picking up a break from any of these hoops fairly straightforward - certainly easier than a normal DSL.



A reverse DSL


The "B" Spread
If the diagonal spread is the most commonly-attempted leave, the "B" spread is probably the most commonly-completed leave.  Basically a "B" spread is a diagonal spread that has gone wrong when it comes to the wiring of the opponent balls at the peg.  Because the peg is narrow, the margins for error are fairly small.
Taking a step back, it is important to identify one of the most crucial parts of setting a DSL, and where a DSL is liable to go wrong - running 3-back.  Because of the distance between 3-back and the peg, it is quite important to get a forward rush out of 3-back to ensure that you are playing the crucial croquet stroke to place one oppo ball near the west boundary while approaching the other, from fairly close range.  It is very easy to lose control of the striker's ball when sending it more than a few yards in a croquet stroke and so any inaccuracies with the croquet stroke after 3-back stroke will compound in the placement of the ball near the peg. All too often, players will fail to get a rush out of 3-back, play a croquet stroke that leaves them a 2-yard roquet on the ball near the peg, and then roquet it so far out of position that they are unable to reliably croquet it back to the wired spot at the peg - this is by far the most common cause of the "B" spread.  If the ball near the peg is left open on the other opponent ball near the west boundary it generally results in leaving a 10-yard shot for the opponent.  



The difference between a DSL and a "B" spread - the image on the left shows red and yellow wired; the image on the right shows yellow is fully open on red


If you have gotten into a position whereby the opponent balls are left open across the peg, then it is worth considering not laying a rush for your partner, but instead wide-joining near corner 4, or in some cases even splitting up your balls completely, with one on the east boundary and the other in or near corner 2.
Do keep in mind that, although the "B" spread is a bad leave, a 10-yard shot still requires hitting, and it is a shot that is missed surprisingly frequently, even by strong players.  This is the advantage of attempting a diagonal spread - if it does go badly wrong and balls are left open, the opponent will still not have any shorter shot than around 10 yards. 
Backing out of a DSL
If your DSL is headed towards being a "B" spread then you have options to back out of it.  After making 3-back and sending an opponent ball towards the west boundary, it is at this point that you need to make a decision to continue with the DSL and risk a "B" spread or to back out and set an OSL - which we will look at further down this article.

Old Standard Leave
The Old Standard Leave, or OSL, was popular in earlier times, particularly in the 1960s.  Traditionally, the standard first-break tactic was to play your break to 4-back, peeling your partner through hoop 1 after 2-back, then after making 3-back to set an OSL (or "standard leave", as they were referred to at that time).  These days, the tactic of peeling partner through hoop 1 after 2-back is almost entirely extinct, as it is generally considered unhelpful - but the OSL is still a strong leave in its own right, whether partner is for H1 or H2.  The leave is very simple to make and leaves a 13-yard shot for the opponent ball at your balls in C4 from A Baulk.  There is no defensive option shot for the opponent to consider and they will have a fairly simple break pickup if they hit.

New Standard Leave
A new leave became popular in the 1990s in favour of the OSL, and is somewhat originally named the "New Standard Leave".  This leave is still one of the most popular leaves done today at the end of a break to 4-back.

There are 2 popular methods of making this leave:

With partner at 2-back - make 1-back off an opponent ball and place it near the west boundary after the hoop, then rush the other opponent ball down the court, loading it to 3-back as a pioneer; make 2-back off partner ball and get a rush to 3-back where the other opponent ball is waiting
With opponent at 2-back - make 2-back and croquet the opponent towards the west boundary while gaining a rush on partner towards 3-back where the other opponent ball is waiting

The first method has the advantage of giving good control over the placement of the west boundary ball whereas the second method has the advantage of not requiring an easterly rush out of 2-back.  Whichever method you choose, it is imperative that the 3-back pioneer is the opponent ball, because after making 3-back, the reception ball will need to be left in a very specific spot a few inches north-east of the hoop.
Placement of ball at H4
The trickiest part of setting the NSL is getting the ball at H4 accurately placed - you need to place it close enough to H4 that the ball will not have a backswing to shoot at your two balls on the east boundary.  You must also ensure that none of the ball is visible from A Baulk - even if an edge is visible it is sometimes possible for the opponent to shoot from A Baulk at a pseudo-double target with the edge of the ball at H4 and one of your balls in the background on the east boundary.  Finally, the ball must not be positioned in such a way that it does not rush to H1
In order to place the ball in the best spot, it is quite important that the approach is played from close-by and slightly south-east of the hoop. The hoop approach should ideally place the opponent ball just north of the ideal wired spot so that the hoop can be run past the reception ball and then roquet it back onto the perfect wired line - see the animation below:



Tap on the image to play the animation.


In the animation above, the grey circle indicates the ideal wired spot for red and the diagonal lines show the area which is wired from A Baulk.  It is perfectly reasonable to try and place the opponent ball in the ideal spot with the hoop approach - doing so will mean that you don't need to roquet it at all after the hoop and can instead just roquet black, leaving red where it is; but beware that trying to place red ideally in the hoop approach and leaving it short will make correcting the wiring more difficult - any roquet on a short red will only be sending it further away from the ideal spot.
Polarity
Unlike the diagonal spread, there is a certain amount of polarity in a NSL, meaning that you can influence the opponent's decision of which ball to play (or at least gain an easier break if they miss with the ball that they want to play) based on whether you place their backward or forward ball at H4 after 3-back.  This is more of an important decision in a game between stronger players who are capable of TP'ing, and also particularly in doubles this can be a critical tactical choice - for example if one of the opponents is a much weaker shot than the other, you would probably want to influence them to take the lift.
If the opponent chooses to lift their ball from H4 and take the "long" lift and misses from C3 to C4, then it is quite difficult for you to dig that ball out of C4 and into your break until you are for H4 yourself; on the other hand if the opponent lifts their ball from the west boundary and shoots from C3 to C4, it gives you the opportunity to establish a 4-ball break before you've even made H1 - you can do this by roqueting partner with your first shot, taking off to the C4 ball and playing a drive from C4, sending a pioneer to H2 while gaining a rush to H1 on the ball near H4.
Now consider that the opponent's clips are on penult and peg for example - it is highly likely in this scenario that the opponent will play their penult ball regardless of the ball positions.  Bearing this in mind, if you place the opponent's penult ball near the west boundary and their peg ball at H4, any missed lift with the penult ball will give you a greater chance at a 4-ball break and a possible TP.
A counter argument on the above scenario may be this: if the opponent (peg and penult) is bound to play their penult ball regardless of the ball positions, placing their penult ball on the west boundary may influence them to take the shorter lift shot from A Baulk instead of the longer shot from B Baulk, as they may correctly decide that missing any shot with their penult ball will give you a 4-ball break before H1.  Consider, instead, that placing the balls the "wrong" way round (peg ball on west boundary; penult ball at H4) and you may find your opponent will ultimately decide to take a longer shot with the penult ball than they may otherwise have done.  There is a balance of probabilities to be made between your expectation of the opponent hitting the long shot vs the short shot, and your reduced chances of making a game-winning break if they miss a more defensive shot into C4.

Advantages

Polarity - can influence opponent to play one ball or the other

Disadvantages

More tricky to make than a DSL
Easy to leave a double target from A Baulk if the ball at H4 is not perfectly placed

MSL (Maugham Standard Leave)
This is a variation on the NSL and was popularised by David Maugham, a leading player in the UK.  Compared to the NSL, instead of leaving a ball floating near the west boundary, after running 1-back under control you will croquet one of the opponent balls onto the middle of the west upright of H2.  In this position it cannot be rushed to H1 but acts as a perfect pioneer for H2.  As the ball at H2 is not rushable to H1, the rush is left for your partner ball to H1.



A MSL after a break by blue


This leave is more difficult to make than a NSL as it requires very good control of your break, particularly around 1-back, but there is a strong case to be made for it.  Assuming all the other clips are for H1, if the opponent lifts the ball from H4 and hits one of your balls down the east boundary from C3, then they will need to get a rush to H1 immediately.  Unless they just managed to snick the lift shot, then they are probably going to be faced with a long and difficult croquet stroke in order to obtain the rush to H1 on your other ball.
Placement of the ball at H2 after 1-back
The exact placement of the opponent ball onto the wire of H2 after running 1-back is shown in the animation below - tap on it to play.



Tap on the image to play the animation.


Blue makes 1-back off yellow with red as the escape ball for the southwards rush; partner (black) is the pioneer at 2-back.  When placing the ball on the wire of H2 after 1-back, you should endeavour to arrange the balls so that the placement is done from close range and can be done with a straight, gentle stop shot; playing this shot with any amount of split will mean that both the pace and the line will be much harder to judge.  Because you want to place the ball using a small straight stop shot, you should give some thought to the placement of the escape ball so that you will automatically gain a rush down the court on it without having to do anything with the striker's ball. 
Another advantage is that if the opponent lifts the ball from H4 and misses the long lift, you will be making H1 off partner (which is always comforting) and will have a perfect H2 pioneer.  This will pretty much guarantee that you are approaching H2 from a matter of inches away, and you can even look to get a dolly rush out of H2 towards C4 to develop the C4 ball before you have made H3.  Additionally, if you are looking at TPs, then having made H1 off partner, it will naturally be sent to H3 / 4b as a pioneer and potential peeling opportunity.
MSL summary
Advantages

Polarity - can influence opponent to play one ball or the other
You start next break by making H1 off partner
Probably the best leave for developing a standard triple opportunity
Potentially difficult break pickup for the opponent

Disadvantages

More tricky to make than a NSL or DSL
Rush to H1 from east boundary is slightly more difficult and is unlikely to be a dolly rush

Bryant Leave
This leave is named after NZ player Greg Bryant, who first started performing it regularly in 1993.  It is really the ultimate in aggressive leaves and is very difficult to make.  One ball is placed in the NSL position at H4, and the other is placed ideally about 1cm directly north of H1, or alternatively against the inside of one of the uprights, on the northern side.  Placement of this ball is difficult to get right and it is very important that none of the ball is showing through H1 on the southern side where it may be easy to hit from A Baulk.  



A Bryant Leave by blue


If you are preparing to make a Bryant Leave, then you must have an opponent ball as your 2-back pioneer.  Having a very close pioneer is important here, and you may consider placing it at 2-back from close range after H5 - ideally the pioneer will be 12 inches or less from 2-back. You should also have the other opponent ball at 1-back as the pioneer, which will naturally be sent out afterwards as the 3-back pioneer
Placement of the opponent ball at H1
This is the crucial part of the Bryant leave.  After making 1-back and loading the opponent ball to 3-back, you need a good rush on the pivot ball towards 2-back.  The pivot should then be placed around 1 yard east and 1 foot north of 2-back as an escape ball before you make 2-back off the opponent ball.



Tap on the image to play the animation.


After 2-back, roquet the opponent reception ball back in front of 2-back as close as possible and then place it into the required position with a delicate stop shot.  After that, you can roquet your escape ball (partner) towards 3-back and make the hoop off the other opponent ball, setting it in the NSL position afterwards.
Bryant Leave summary
Advantages

Opponent has no defensive shot so any miss will give you all the balls immediately
Artificial polarity - the opponent will still be more inclined to lift the ball from H1 despite having no safe shots
If the ball placed at H4 is for H2, it can be very tough to pick up a break after hitting the lift
Looks really cool

Disadvantages

There is no grey area - opponent has no defensive shot so may as well take the shortest shot
Difficult to make

Defensive Spread
A very good, and probably under-used, leave.  This leave is great if you are the stronger player playing against a weaker player.  While it only leaves a 13-yard lift shot, it gives very poor break prospects if the lift is hit.

The leave above is one variation of the defensive spread - a mirror image of the same leave can also be made, with blue/black laid up in C4 and one opponent ball near C2 and the other peg-high on the east boundary.
The variation where blue and black are laid up in C2 is an incredibly strong leave when red is for H3 (either by breaking down or by POPs during blue's break) and yellow is for 4-back - if red hits any lift shot whatsoever, its break  prospects are slim at best; on the other hand, a miss by red gives black strong prospects of starting a second break.  Even a more defensive miss of yellow at black gives fairly good break prospects for black.
This leave is perhaps at its best on a difficult lawn where picking up breaks is more challenging, and so you do not want to gift the opponent a break with balls in the middle of the court if they happen to hit your lift.  
Defensive Spread summary
Advantages

Very strong - if the clips are right
Gives very slim break prospects to your opponent if they hit the lift
Polarity - the opponent has aggressive and defensive lift shot options

Disadvantages

13-yard lift shot is conceded
Requires several accurate rushes to get exactly right

Vertical Spread
The vertical spread is generally thought of as a second-break leave, meaning that you would look to make this leave at the end of a break to the peg, normally when your partner has well advanced clips.  It is quite common to see players make this leave when their partner ball is for 4-back, however I would not advise doing so - it can be very difficult to finish from 4-back and peg after a miss by the opponent, and there are generally better leave options available for these clips.

The Vertical Spread is actually quite easy to make, because the opponent balls can be placed from close range after running penult and rover without having to play any difficult shots.  The exact placement of the two balls at penult and rover is also not as crucial as it is when placing a ball on the back of H1 for example, because penult and rover are further from baulk.  Still, you should aim to achieve ideal position of the two opponent balls as it will give greater flexibility when deciding where to lay your own balls up at the conclusion of the turn.  The ball at penult should be placed in the front of the jaws of H6 - it is also fine to be up against one wire or the other, so long as it is on the inside of the wire and not visible from baulk, and the ball should ideally not be showing through the hoop on the non-playing side of H6.  The position for the ball at rover is essentially the same, but mirrored.
The most obvious use case for this leave is when partner (black in this case) is for penult, as it will give you an easy finishing turn from any missed lift.  Please note the diagram above has the opponent balls laid up on the east boundary, but you can just as easily lay up on the west boundary, which may enable an easier rush to penult.
You can also think of this leave as a fairly defensive leave.  If the opponent already has an advanced clip, e.g. they are for 4-back and H1, then you should try and arrange their forward ball to be the ball left south of penult. Doing this will encourage them to lift their forward ball, however if they do decide to shoot and hit with their backward ball, their break pick-up will be very difficult indeed, because the ball left in penult cannot be rushed to either H1 or H2.
Vertical spread summary
Advantages

Relatively easy to make
Very strong break prospects for your partner ball (if the clips are right)
Very poor break prospects for the opponent ball (if the clips are right)

Disadvantages

Limited value if partner clip is not for penult (or H5)

Cross-Peg
You can think of the cross-peg leave a bit like a diagonal spread, but with the west boundary ball about 12 yards further in court than normal.  The way you go about making the cross-peg is the essentially the same as that of the DSL, but after making your final hoop of the turn, you need to get a good rush to the peg where the other two balls are waiting.



A cross-peg after a break to the peg by blue


Because the rush out of your final hoop is so crucial to getting a good cross-peg, you would not frequently see this leave after a break to 4-back - making 3-back with control and a dolly rush to the peg is relatively difficult for relatively little gain in having a cross-peg instead of a DSL.  It is much more common to set this leave after running rover when your partner is for 4-back or penult.  Running rover and obtaining a dolly rush to the peg is significantly easier than the same out of 3-back, and what's more, rover is significantly closer to the peg than 3-back is.  The benefit of a cross-peg over a DSL is also more evident when for 4-back, because at the start of your next turn you will avoid the slightly tricky cross-court rushes from the east boundary to the west boundary, and also from there to 4-back.

The crucial thing to remember when setting the cross-peg leave (aside from the actual wiring itself) is that you should make sure the two opponent balls are placed slightly off horizontal to each other; the westerly ball should be just north of the peg and the easterly ball just south of the peg.  If this is not achieved, then it is likely that the opponent will have a 13-yard shot from somewhere on the court.

Cross-Wire
A cross-wiring leave is where you leave both opponent balls close together at a hoop, wired from each other.  Cross-wiring can be done at any hoop, although it is not considered a lift leave - you should only plan to cross-wire if you have not made a lift hoop during your turn, otherwise the opponent will probably have a very short shot from one of the baulk lines.



Red and yellow are cross-wired at black's hoop


There is a sequence you should try to follow when making most cross-wires, which is:

Before making your final hoop, arrange one opponent ball and partner ball at the intended cross-wiring hoop
Make your final hoop off the opponent ball and gain a rush towards the cross-wiring hoop
Wire the two opponent balls at the hoop
Rush the escape ball (partner) away to a far corner

Cross-wiring opportunities
Cross-wiring is not a lift leave, so unless you are planning on laying for sextuples, most of the opportunities to do so tend to arise more by chance.  For example, if your clips are for penult and 3-back, and you hit in with your ball for penult, you can safely make your last two hoops without conceding a lift. In the example below, blue is for penult, black for 3-back; yellow has just broken down at H6 on a break.  Click the solution button below the image to see how blue might go about playing its next turn.

As you can see, the cross-wire is an incredibly strong leave and you should always be on the lookout for opportunities to make it - it will give a very long shot to your opponent, and an easy break if they miss, putting you in a very strong game position.
The (delayed) sextuple leave (or "1-back leave")
The main reasoning for playing for sextuples at all is to avoid the conceding of a lift, and so it is here where we can take advantage of cross-wiring as a standard part of a leave.  Below is a common leave seen when laying for a sextuple, leaving red and yellow the longest possible shot on the court:  



A 1-back leave - red and yellow cross-wired at H1 with blue and black laid up near C3

To set this leave, you follow the same pattern outlined further above.  Before making hoop 6 (the final hoop of your turn), you should arrange one opponent and partner ball at hoop 1 (the cross-wiring hoop).  Make H6 with a rush back to H1 and cross-wire the opponent balls across the hoop, preferably diagonally, and gain a rush on partner ball towards C3.
The standard sextuple leave
Despite the name, this sextuple leave is rarely seen, both because it is much harder to get right, and also leaves a significantly shorter shot for the opponent.  The benefits of this leave as far as the sextuple goes is that it makes the sextuple turn a great deal easier, essentially nothing more than a quadruple peel. The standard sextuple leave is as follows:

As you can see, when setting this leave, you actually complete the cross-wiring after H5, then rush partner to H6 to score that hoop, afterwards gaining a rush to 1-back.  The reason this method is favoured for this particular leave is so that you can be rushing to 1-back from close range (near H6) instead of from near 2-back as you would have to do when performing the cross-wire after H6. Rushing to 1-back from close range helps you to obtain a good position for the jawsing of your ball in 1-back.
Polarity in cross-wiring leaves
In reality, leaving both opponent balls together (albeit wired from each other) means that there is little-to-no polarity to be had; however, there are some things you can do to still encourage one ball to play over the other.  Imagine that blue has cross-wired red and yellow at H1  (black's hoop).  Red is for 4-back and yellow is for peg, and as such, the striker of blue and black would want to  encourage yellow to play by substantially lengthening red's shot - the following leave is able to achieve this:



A 1-back leave with a degree of polarity - red is the opponent's backward ball so its shot at blue/black has been lengthened


Red is placed very near the south boundary as a deliberately poor pioneer at H1, and the length of red's shot is increased by 5-6 yards over what it would be in a normal cross-wire.  Placing red as a deliberately poor pioneer at H1 may encourage yellow to play.  Be aware, of course, that placing balls deliberately close to the boundary should only be done if you are confident of picking up a break from those positions afterwards, particularly bearing in mind that yellow may choose to corner.
Cross-wiring summary
Advantages

Ultimate distance between the opponent's balls and yours - normally 30+ yards
Gives you an easy break with a ball at your hoop if they miss

Disadvantages

No grey area - opponent is generally compelled to shoot
Not much polarity to be had
Opponent generally has an easy break if they hit (depending on clips)

Third Turn Leaves
Generally when referring to a third-turn leave we are referring to when a player has hit on the third turn of the game and played a break to 4-back with 3 balls, then set a leave.  Bearing in mind that the fourth ball is not yet played into the game, the opponent does not have the option of which ball to play with their fourth-turn shot - they must play the remaining ball.  As such, there are opportunities to set a leave utilising the opponent's ball in close proximity to your own.
Three Ducks Leave
This leave is probably the most popular of all the third-turn leaves after a break to 4-back.



The standard Three Ducks leave after a break to 4-back by blue


The Three Ducks is so named because the balls are arranged like "ducks in a row", near the west boundary.  The best way to arrange this leave is to have your H1 ball near/on the west boundary, with the opponent ball about 1 yard further in-court and your 4-back ball another yard further in again - assuming an opponent miss, this then enables you to set an opponent ball as the H2 pioneer and take partner ball to H1 - which in turn will be sent to H3 / 4b for potential peeling opportunities later.
The Three Ducks is the most aggressive of the third-turn leaves and doesn't really leave any defensive option for the opponent.  Having said that, if the opponent takes the longer lift shot from C1 through to C2, it can be a bit tricky to dig the C2 ball out if you do not get a forward rush out of H1.  If no forward rush is achieved, you may choose to take off to C2 instead of croquet partner ball to H3.
Reverse Three Ducks Leave
A perfectly valid option, but far less frequently used.  This is a mirror image of the regular Three Ducks, although it is probably a bit more difficult to pick up a break from a missed lift.  It is easier to make than the regular Three Ducks as it doesn't require control out of 3b.



A reverse Three Ducks leave


If the opponent misses the shot from C3 to C4 there is an interesting opportunity to play a bombard on the in-lawn ball to H1 while approaching the ball in C4 - certainly it is not the kind of shot you would want to approach without having practised it, but if played successfully, gives an immediate 4-ball break.  
Third-Turn NSL
This leave is just like a regular NSL but obviously with a ball missing.  Again it's best to have your 4-back ball in the NSL position at H4, so the way you go about making this leave is slightly different than a normal NSL.



A third turn NSL by blue


After making 3-back you can rush partner out to the east boundary, then rush the opponent's ball back slightly south of 3-back.  A little stop shot is then played to send the opponent ball out towards partner while approaching the intended wired spot at H4 with striker's ball.
Another method would be to rush both partner and opponent out towards their east boundary positions, and then takeoff back to place your ball in the wired spot at H4. 
The fourth turn shot from the opponent is the exact equivalent of them lifting the ball from the west boundary and taking their lift shot.
Third-Turn Defensive Spread
The third-turn leave favoured by stronger players - this looks a lot like a DSL but with the peg ball missing.



A third-turn Defensive Spread by blue


After a fourth-turn miss from the opponent, the break pickup is similar to that of a DSL, but ideally the initial rush is left for the H1 ball on the opponent's ball, and your 4-back ball is placed on or near the west boundary. This gives the advantage of taking the rush to H1 with partner. 
When making this leave, very strong players will likely play their 4-back ball all the way to the west boundary with their final shot for blue, instead of lagging the ball a yard or two from the yardline - this adds more defence to the leave, and means that if the opponent does hit the long lift their break pick-up will be even more difficult.

Super Advanced Leaves

The Super Advanced game is a slightly modified version of association croquet that is played at championship level in England.  It incorporates an additional lift (at hoop 4) when compared to normal advanced rules, and hence changes the tactics and first-break leaves quite considerably.  As a result, all the golden rules for leave-making go out the window.  A separate article about super advanced first-break tactics and leaves is available here

Leaves
A "leave" in croquet is the culmination of the process of arranging the balls at the end of your turn.  The idea is that you keep the "innings", which normally means laying the court in an adventageous way for your partner ball, and that the opponent balls will be far apart, or at least wired from each other, with no short shots available.
What makes a good leave?

Your two balls close together with a useful rush
No shot shorter than 13 yards for the opponent, and no double target

What makes a great leave?

Your next turn is easier if the opponent misses than their turn is if they hit
No shot shorter than 17 yards for the opponent
Leaving some grey area - options available for the opponent to take a longer, more defensive shot
Polarity - influencing the opponent to play one ball over another, due to where it is positioned

Golden rules for making leaves
When all four balls are on the lawn, there are really two golden rules to leave-making that you should try to adhere to at all times.  Firstly, you should ensure that the very final ball you roquet in your turn should be your partner ball - this helps to organise a good rush for starting your next turn.  Secondly, you should try and ensure to always make your final hoop of the turn off an opponent's ball.  These two points are somewhat interrelated in that if you make your final hoop off the opponent, you will be roqueting it first after making the hoop, leaving partner ball "live" to be roqueted in a few strokes' time.

Diagonal Spread
The diagonal spread leave, or DSL for short, is probably the most commonly-attempted leave in croquet.  The reasons for this are that it is relatively easy to make, it is relatively forgiving if it goes horribly wrong, and doesn't leave any short shots from any baulk line.  It is a fairly hoop-agnostic leave, meaning that it is generally pretty easy to pick up a break from a DSL after a miss by the opponent, regardless of the hoop you are for.  In the example below, a DSL has been made after a break to 4-back by blue, with partner ball (black) for hoop 1.

As discussed in the golden rules above, the opponent ball is sent to 3-back (the final hoop of the turn).  Interestingly a good way to help achieve this is to organise earlier in the break to send partner to 2-back as an early pioneer after hoop 5 - if you send partner to 2-back then the 3-back pioneer will naturally be one of the opponent balls.
Before making 3-back you should organise the other opponent ball near the peg, fairly close to where you want its final position to be, and organise your partner ball 1-2 yards east of it to act as the escape ball. After making 3-back and croqueting the reception ball out towards the west boundary, you should try and rush the opponent ball by the peg into a wired spot immediately - the closer you can get it to the wired spot using a rush, the easier your job will be to wire it with the croquet stroke. Once the ball at the peg has been placed in the wired spot, you rush your escape ball (partner) out to the east boundary and lay a rush into the court for your partner ball, with both balls being wired from the ball at the peg, and ideally also wired from the ball near the west boundary.
Reverse DSL
A reverse diagonal spread is made in exactly the same way, but just organising the balls in a mirror-image, as in the diagram below.  Actually this can be quite a useful leave after a break to the peg when your partner ball is on 2-back, 3-back or 4-back as it makes picking up a break from any of these hoops fairly straightforward - certainly easier than a normal DSL.



A reverse DSL


The "B" Spread
If the diagonal spread is the most commonly-attempted leave, the "B" spread is probably the most commonly-completed leave.  Basically a "B" spread is a diagonal spread that has gone wrong when it comes to the wiring of the opponent balls at the peg.  Because the peg is narrow, the margins for error are fairly small.
Taking a step back, it is important to identify one of the most crucial parts of setting a DSL, and where a DSL is liable to go wrong - running 3-back.  Because of the distance between 3-back and the peg, it is quite important to get a forward rush out of 3-back to ensure that you are playing the crucial croquet stroke to place one oppo ball near the west boundary while approaching the other, from fairly close range.  It is very easy to lose control of the striker's ball when sending it more than a few yards in a croquet stroke and so any inaccuracies with the croquet stroke after 3-back stroke will compound in the placement of the ball near the peg. All too often, players will fail to get a rush out of 3-back, play a croquet stroke that leaves them a 2-yard roquet on the ball near the peg, and then roquet it so far out of position that they are unable to reliably croquet it back to the wired spot at the peg - this is by far the most common cause of the "B" spread.  If the ball near the peg is left open on the other opponent ball near the west boundary it generally results in leaving a 10-yard shot for the opponent.  



The difference between a DSL and a "B" spread - the image on the left shows red and yellow wired; the image on the right shows yellow is fully open on red


If you have gotten into a position whereby the opponent balls are left open across the peg, then it is worth considering not laying a rush for your partner, but instead wide-joining near corner 4, or in some cases even splitting up your balls completely, with one on the east boundary and the other in or near corner 2.
Do keep in mind that, although the "B" spread is a bad leave, a 10-yard shot still requires hitting, and it is a shot that is missed surprisingly frequently, even by strong players.  This is the advantage of attempting a diagonal spread - if it does go badly wrong and balls are left open, the opponent will still not have any shorter shot than around 10 yards. 
Backing out of a DSL
If your DSL is headed towards being a "B" spread then you have options to back out of it.  After making 3-back and sending an opponent ball towards the west boundary, it is at this point that you need to make a decision to continue with the DSL and risk a "B" spread or to back out and set an OSL - which we will look at further down this article.

Old Standard Leave
The Old Standard Leave, or OSL, was popular in earlier times, particularly in the 1960s.  Traditionally, the standard first-break tactic was to play your break to 4-back, peeling your partner through hoop 1 after 2-back, then after making 3-back to set an OSL (or "standard leave", as they were referred to at that time).  These days, the tactic of peeling partner through hoop 1 after 2-back is almost entirely extinct, as it is generally considered unhelpful - but the OSL is still a strong leave in its own right, whether partner is for H1 or H2.  The leave is very simple to make and leaves a 13-yard shot for the opponent ball at your balls in C4 from A Baulk.  There is no defensive option shot for the opponent to consider and they will have a fairly simple break pickup if they hit.

New Standard Leave
A new leave became popular in the 1990s in favour of the OSL, and is somewhat originally named the "New Standard Leave".  This leave is still one of the most popular leaves done today at the end of a break to 4-back.

There are 2 popular methods of making this leave:

With partner at 2-back - make 1-back off an opponent ball and place it near the west boundary after the hoop, then rush the other opponent ball down the court, loading it to 3-back as a pioneer; make 2-back off partner ball and get a rush to 3-back where the other opponent ball is waiting
With opponent at 2-back - make 2-back and croquet the opponent towards the west boundary while gaining a rush on partner towards 3-back where the other opponent ball is waiting

The first method has the advantage of giving good control over the placement of the west boundary ball whereas the second method has the advantage of not requiring an easterly rush out of 2-back.  Whichever method you choose, it is imperative that the 3-back pioneer is the opponent ball, because after making 3-back, the reception ball will need to be left in a very specific spot a few inches north-east of the hoop.
Placement of ball at H4
The trickiest part of setting the NSL is getting the ball at H4 accurately placed - you need to place it close enough to H4 that the ball will not have a backswing to shoot at your two balls on the east boundary.  You must also ensure that none of the ball is visible from A Baulk - even if an edge is visible it is sometimes possible for the opponent to shoot from A Baulk at a pseudo-double target with the edge of the ball at H4 and one of your balls in the background on the east boundary.  Finally, the ball must not be positioned in such a way that it does not rush to H1
In order to place the ball in the best spot, it is quite important that the approach is played from close-by and slightly south-east of the hoop. The hoop approach should ideally place the opponent ball just north of the ideal wired spot so that the hoop can be run past the reception ball and then roquet it back onto the perfect wired line - see the animation below:



Tap on the image to play the animation.


In the animation above, the grey circle indicates the ideal wired spot for red and the diagonal lines show the area which is wired from A Baulk.  It is perfectly reasonable to try and place the opponent ball in the ideal spot with the hoop approach - doing so will mean that you don't need to roquet it at all after the hoop and can instead just roquet black, leaving red where it is; but beware that trying to place red ideally in the hoop approach and leaving it short will make correcting the wiring more difficult - any roquet on a short red will only be sending it further away from the ideal spot.
Polarity
Unlike the diagonal spread, there is a certain amount of polarity in a NSL, meaning that you can influence the opponent's decision of which ball to play (or at least gain an easier break if they miss with the ball that they want to play) based on whether you place their backward or forward ball at H4 after 3-back.  This is more of an important decision in a game between stronger players who are capable of TP'ing, and also particularly in doubles this can be a critical tactical choice - for example if one of the opponents is a much weaker shot than the other, you would probably want to influence them to take the lift.
If the opponent chooses to lift their ball from H4 and take the "long" lift and misses from C3 to C4, then it is quite difficult for you to dig that ball out of C4 and into your break until you are for H4 yourself; on the other hand if the opponent lifts their ball from the west boundary and shoots from C3 to C4, it gives you the opportunity to establish a 4-ball break before you've even made H1 - you can do this by roqueting partner with your first shot, taking off to the C4 ball and playing a drive from C4, sending a pioneer to H2 while gaining a rush to H1 on the ball near H4.
Now consider that the opponent's clips are on penult and peg for example - it is highly likely in this scenario that the opponent will play their penult ball regardless of the ball positions.  Bearing this in mind, if you place the opponent's penult ball near the west boundary and their peg ball at H4, any missed lift with the penult ball will give you a greater chance at a 4-ball break and a possible TP.
A counter argument on the above scenario may be this: if the opponent (peg and penult) is bound to play their penult ball regardless of the ball positions, placing their penult ball on the west boundary may influence them to take the shorter lift shot from A Baulk instead of the longer shot from B Baulk, as they may correctly decide that missing any shot with their penult ball will give you a 4-ball break before H1.  Consider, instead, that placing the balls the "wrong" way round (peg ball on west boundary; penult ball at H4) and you may find your opponent will ultimately decide to take a longer shot with the penult ball than they may otherwise have done.  There is a balance of probabilities to be made between your expectation of the opponent hitting the long shot vs the short shot, and your reduced chances of making a game-winning break if they miss a more defensive shot into C4.

Advantages

Polarity - can influence opponent to play one ball or the other

Disadvantages

More tricky to make than a DSL
Easy to leave a double target from A Baulk if the ball at H4 is not perfectly placed

MSL (Maugham Standard Leave)
This is a variation on the NSL and was popularised by David Maugham, a leading player in the UK.  Compared to the NSL, instead of leaving a ball floating near the west boundary, after running 1-back under control you will croquet one of the opponent balls onto the middle of the west upright of H2.  In this position it cannot be rushed to H1 but acts as a perfect pioneer for H2.  As the ball at H2 is not rushable to H1, the rush is left for your partner ball to H1.



A MSL after a break by blue


This leave is more difficult to make than a NSL as it requires very good control of your break, particularly around 1-back, but there is a strong case to be made for it.  Assuming all the other clips are for H1, if the opponent lifts the ball from H4 and hits one of your balls down the east boundary from C3, then they will need to get a rush to H1 immediately.  Unless they just managed to snick the lift shot, then they are probably going to be faced with a long and difficult croquet stroke in order to obtain the rush to H1 on your other ball.
Placement of the ball at H2 after 1-back
The exact placement of the opponent ball onto the wire of H2 after running 1-back is shown in the animation below - tap on it to play.



Tap on the image to play the animation.


Blue makes 1-back off yellow with red as the escape ball for the southwards rush; partner (black) is the pioneer at 2-back.  When placing the ball on the wire of H2 after 1-back, you should endeavour to arrange the balls so that the placement is done from close range and can be done with a straight, gentle stop shot; playing this shot with any amount of split will mean that both the pace and the line will be much harder to judge.  Because you want to place the ball using a small straight stop shot, you should give some thought to the placement of the escape ball so that you will automatically gain a rush down the court on it without having to do anything with the striker's ball. 
Another advantage is that if the opponent lifts the ball from H4 and misses the long lift, you will be making H1 off partner (which is always comforting) and will have a perfect H2 pioneer.  This will pretty much guarantee that you are approaching H2 from a matter of inches away, and you can even look to get a dolly rush out of H2 towards C4 to develop the C4 ball before you have made H3.  Additionally, if you are looking at TPs, then having made H1 off partner, it will naturally be sent to H3 / 4b as a pioneer and potential peeling opportunity.
MSL summary
Advantages

Polarity - can influence opponent to play one ball or the other
You start next break by making H1 off partner
Probably the best leave for developing a standard triple opportunity
Potentially difficult break pickup for the opponent

Disadvantages

More tricky to make than a NSL or DSL
Rush to H1 from east boundary is slightly more difficult and is unlikely to be a dolly rush

Bryant Leave
This leave is named after NZ player Greg Bryant, who first started performing it regularly in 1993.  It is really the ultimate in aggressive leaves and is very difficult to make.  One ball is placed in the NSL position at H4, and the other is placed ideally about 1cm directly north of H1, or alternatively against the inside of one of the uprights, on the northern side.  Placement of this ball is difficult to get right and it is very important that none of the ball is showing through H1 on the southern side where it may be easy to hit from A Baulk.  



A Bryant Leave by blue


If you are preparing to make a Bryant Leave, then you must have an opponent ball as your 2-back pioneer.  Having a very close pioneer is important here, and you may consider placing it at 2-back from close range after H5 - ideally the pioneer will be 12 inches or less from 2-back. You should also have the other opponent ball at 1-back as the pioneer, which will naturally be sent out afterwards as the 3-back pioneer
Placement of the opponent ball at H1
This is the crucial part of the Bryant leave.  After making 1-back and loading the opponent ball to 3-back, you need a good rush on the pivot ball towards 2-back.  The pivot should then be placed around 1 yard east and 1 foot north of 2-back as an escape ball before you make 2-back off the opponent ball.



Tap on the image to play the animation.


After 2-back, roquet the opponent reception ball back in front of 2-back as close as possible and then place it into the required position with a delicate stop shot.  After that, you can roquet your escape ball (partner) towards 3-back and make the hoop off the other opponent ball, setting it in the NSL position afterwards.
Bryant Leave summary
Advantages

Opponent has no defensive shot so any miss will give you all the balls immediately
Artificial polarity - the opponent will still be more inclined to lift the ball from H1 despite having no safe shots
If the ball placed at H4 is for H2, it can be very tough to pick up a break after hitting the lift
Looks really cool

Disadvantages

There is no grey area - opponent has no defensive shot so may as well take the shortest shot
Difficult to make

Defensive Spread
A very good, and probably under-used, leave.  This leave is great if you are the stronger player playing against a weaker player.  While it only leaves a 13-yard lift shot, it gives very poor break prospects if the lift is hit.

The leave above is one variation of the defensive spread - a mirror image of the same leave can also be made, with blue/black laid up in C4 and one opponent ball near C2 and the other peg-high on the east boundary.
The variation where blue and black are laid up in C2 is an incredibly strong leave when red is for H3 (either by breaking down or by POPs during blue's break) and yellow is for 4-back - if red hits any lift shot whatsoever, its break  prospects are slim at best; on the other hand, a miss by red gives black strong prospects of starting a second break.  Even a more defensive miss of yellow at black gives fairly good break prospects for black.
This leave is perhaps at its best on a difficult lawn where picking up breaks is more challenging, and so you do not want to gift the opponent a break with balls in the middle of the court if they happen to hit your lift.  
Defensive Spread summary
Advantages

Polarity - the opponent has aggressive and defensive lift shot options

Disadvantages

Vertical Spread
The vertical spread is generally thought of as a second-break leave, meaning that you would look to make this leave at the end of a break to the peg, normally when your partner has well advanced clips.  It is quite common to see players make this leave when their partner ball is for 4-back, however I would not advise doing so - it can be very difficult to finish from 4-back and peg after a miss by the opponent, and there are generally better leave options available for these clips.

The Vertical Spread is actually quite easy to make, because the opponent balls can be placed from close range after running penult and rover without having to play any difficult shots.  The exact placement of the two balls at penult and rover is also not as crucial as it is when placing a ball on the back of H1 for example, because penult and rover are further from baulk.  Still, you should aim to achieve ideal position of the two opponent balls as it will give greater flexibility when deciding where to lay your own balls up at the conclusion of the turn.  The ball at penult should be placed in the front of the jaws of H6 - it is also fine to be up against one wire or the other, so long as it is on the inside of the wire and not visible from baulk, and the ball should ideally not be showing through the hoop on the non-playing side of H6.  The position for the ball at rover is essentially the same, but mirrored.
The most obvious use case for this leave is when partner (black in this case) is for penult, as it will give you an easy finishing turn from any missed lift.  Please note the diagram above has the opponent balls laid up on the east boundary, but you can just as easily lay up on the west boundary, which may enable an easier rush to penult.
You can also think of this leave as a fairly defensive leave.  If the opponent already has an advanced clip, e.g. they are for 4-back and H1, then you should try and arrange their forward ball to be the ball left south of penult. Doing this will encourage them to lift their forward ball, however if they do decide to shoot and hit with their backward ball, their break pick-up will be very difficult indeed, because the ball left in penult cannot be rushed to either H1 or H2.
Vertical spread summary
Advantages

Relatively easy to make
Very strong break prospects for your partner ball (if the clips are right)
Very poor break prospects for the opponent ball (if the clips are right)

Disadvantages

Limited value if partner clip is not for penult (or H5)

Cross-Peg
You can think of the cross-peg leave a bit like a diagonal spread, but with the west boundary ball about 12 yards further in court than normal.  The way you go about making the cross-peg is the essentially the same as that of the DSL, but after making your final hoop of the turn, you need to get a good rush to the peg where the other two balls are waiting.



A cross-peg after a break to the peg by blue


Because the rush out of your final hoop is so crucial to getting a good cross-peg, you would not frequently see this leave after a break to 4-back - making 3-back with control and a dolly rush to the peg is relatively difficult for relatively little gain in having a cross-peg instead of a DSL.  It is much more common to set this leave after running rover when your partner is for 4-back or penult.  Running rover and obtaining a dolly rush to the peg is significantly easier than the same out of 3-back, and what's more, rover is significantly closer to the peg than 3-back is.  The benefit of a cross-peg over a DSL is also more evident when for 4-back, because at the start of your next turn you will avoid the slightly tricky cross-court rushes from the east boundary to the west boundary, and also from there to 4-back.  



Tap on the image to play the animation.


The crucial thing to remember when setting the cross-peg leave (aside from the actual wiring itself) is that you should make sure the two opponent balls are placed slightly off horizontal to each other; the westerly ball should be just north of the peg and the easterly ball just south of the peg.  If this is not achieved, then it is likely that the opponent will have a 13-yard shot from somewhere on the court.

Easy to finish from 4-back and peg after a missed lift

Disadvantages

Wiring at close range at the peg can easily go wrong

Cross-Wire
A cross-wiring leave is where you leave both opponent balls close together at a hoop, wired from each other.  Cross-wiring can be done at any hoop, although it is not considered a lift leave - you should only plan to cross-wire if you have not made a lift hoop during your turn, otherwise the opponent will probably have a very short shot from one of the baulk lines.



Red and yellow are cross-wired at black's hoop


There is a sequence you should try to follow when making most cross-wires, which is:

Before making your final hoop, arrange one opponent ball and partner ball at the intended cross-wiring hoop
Make your final hoop off the opponent ball and gain a rush towards the cross-wiring hoop
Wire the two opponent balls at the hoop
Rush the escape ball (partner) away to a far corner

Cross-wiring opportunities
Cross-wiring is not a lift leave, so unless you are planning on laying for sextuples, most of the opportunities to do so tend to arise more by chance.  For example, if your clips are for penult and 3-back, and you hit in with your ball for penult, you can safely make your last two hoops without conceding a lift. In the example below, blue is for penult, black for 3-back; yellow has just broken down at H6 on a break.  Click the solution button below the image to see how blue might go about playing its next turn.

As you can see, the cross-wire is an incredibly strong leave and you should always be on the lookout for opportunities to make it - it will give a very long shot to your opponent, and an easy break if they miss, putting you in a very strong game position.
The (delayed) sextuple leave (or "1-back leave")
The main reasoning for playing for sextuples at all is to avoid the conceding of a lift, and so it is here where we can take advantage of cross-wiring as a standard part of a leave.  Below is a common leave seen when laying for a sextuple, leaving red and yellow the longest possible shot on the court:  



A 1-back leave - red and yellow cross-wired at H1 with blue and black laid up near C3

To set this leave, you follow the same pattern outlined further above.  Before making hoop 6 (the final hoop of your turn), you should arrange one opponent and partner ball at hoop 1 (the cross-wiring hoop).  Make H6 with a rush back to H1 and cross-wire the opponent balls across the hoop, preferably diagonally, and gain a rush on partner ball towards C3.
The standard sextuple leave
Despite the name, this sextuple leave is rarely seen, both because it is much harder to get right, and also leaves a significantly shorter shot for the opponent.  The benefits of this leave as far as the sextuple goes is that it makes the sextuple turn a great deal easier, essentially nothing more than a quadruple peel. The standard sextuple leave is as follows:

As you can see, when setting this leave, you actually complete the cross-wiring after H5, then rush partner to H6 to score that hoop, afterwards gaining a rush to 1-back.  The reason this method is favoured for this particular leave is so that you can be rushing to 1-back from close range (near H6) instead of from near 2-back as you would have to do when performing the cross-wire after H6. Rushing to 1-back from close range helps you to obtain a good position for the jawsing of your ball in 1-back.
Polarity in cross-wiring leaves
In reality, leaving both opponent balls together (albeit wired from each other) means that there is little-to-no polarity to be had; however, there are some things you can do to still encourage one ball to play over the other.  Imagine that blue has cross-wired red and yellow at H1  (black's hoop).  Red is for 4-back and yellow is for peg, and as such, the striker of blue and black would want to  encourage yellow to play by substantially lengthening red's shot - the following leave is able to achieve this:



A 1-back leave with a degree of polarity - red is the opponent's backward ball so its shot at blue/black has been lengthened


Red is placed very near the south boundary as a deliberately poor pioneer at H1, and the length of red's shot is increased by 5-6 yards over what it would be in a normal cross-wire.  Placing red as a deliberately poor pioneer at H1 may encourage yellow to play.  Be aware, of course, that placing balls deliberately close to the boundary should only be done if you are confident of picking up a break from those positions afterwards, particularly bearing in mind that yellow may choose to corner.
Cross-wiring summary
Advantages

Ultimate distance between the opponent's balls and yours - normally 30+ yards
Gives you an easy break with a ball at your hoop if they miss

Disadvantages

No grey area - opponent is generally compelled to shoot
Not much polarity to be had
Opponent generally has an easy break if they hit (depending on clips)

Third Turn Leaves
Generally when referring to a third-turn leave we are referring to when a player has hit on the third turn of the game and played a break to 4-back with 3 balls, then set a leave.  Bearing in mind that the fourth ball is not yet played into the game, the opponent does not have the option of which ball to play with their fourth-turn shot - they must play the remaining ball.  As such, there are opportunities to set a leave utilising the opponent's ball in close proximity to your own.
Three Ducks Leave
This leave is probably the most popular of all the third-turn leaves after a break to 4-back.



The standard Three Ducks leave after a break to 4-back by blue


The Three Ducks is so named because the balls are arranged like "ducks in a row", near the west boundary.  The best way to arrange this leave is to have your H1 ball near/on the west boundary, with the opponent ball about 1 yard further in-court and your 4-back ball another yard further in again - assuming an opponent miss, this then enables you to set an opponent ball as the H2 pioneer and take partner ball to H1 - which in turn will be sent to H3 / 4b for potential peeling opportunities later.
The Three Ducks is the most aggressive of the third-turn leaves and doesn't really leave any defensive option for the opponent.  Having said that, if the opponent takes the longer lift shot from C1 through to C2, it can be a bit tricky to dig the C2 ball out if you do not get a forward rush out of H1.  If no forward rush is achieved, you may choose to take off to C2 instead of croquet partner ball to H3.
Reverse Three Ducks Leave
A perfectly valid option, but far less frequently used.  This is a mirror image of the regular Three Ducks, although it is probably a bit more difficult to pick up a break from a missed lift.  It is easier to make than the regular Three Ducks as it doesn't require control out of 3b.



A reverse Three Ducks leave


If the opponent misses the shot from C3 to C4 there is an interesting opportunity to play a bombard on the in-lawn ball to H1 while approaching the ball in C4 - certainly it is not the kind of shot you would want to approach without having practised it, but if played successfully, gives an immediate 4-ball break.  
Third-Turn NSL
This leave is just like a regular NSL but obviously with a ball missing.  Again it's best to have your 4-back ball in the NSL position at H4, so the way you go about making this leave is slightly different than a normal NSL.



A third turn NSL by blue


After making 3-back you can rush partner out to the east boundary, then rush the opponent's ball back slightly south of 3-back.  A little stop shot is then played to send the opponent ball out towards partner while approaching the intended wired spot at H4 with striker's ball.
Another method would be to rush both partner and opponent out towards their east boundary positions, and then takeoff back to place your ball in the wired spot at H4. 
The fourth turn shot from the opponent is the exact equivalent of them lifting the ball from the west boundary and taking their lift shot.
Third-Turn Defensive Spread
The third-turn leave favoured by stronger players - this looks a lot like a DSL but with the peg ball missing.



A third-turn Defensive Spread by blue


After a fourth-turn miss from the opponent, the break pickup is similar to that of a DSL, but ideally the initial rush is left for the H1 ball on the opponent's ball, and your 4-back ball is placed on or near the west boundary. This gives the advantage of taking the rush to H1 with partner. 
When making this leave, very strong players will likely play their 4-back ball all the way to the west boundary with their final shot for blue, instead of lagging the ball a yard or two from the yardline - this adds more defence to the leave, and means that if the opponent does hit the long lift their break pick-up will be even more difficult.

Super Advanced Leaves

The Super Advanced game is a slightly modified version of association croquet that is played at championship level in England.  It incorporates an additional lift (at hoop 4) when compared to normal advanced rules, and hence changes the tactics and first-break leaves quite considerably.  As a result, all the golden rules for leave-making go out the window.  A separate article about super advanced first-break tactics and leaves is available here

Leaves
A "leave" in croquet is the culmination of the process of arranging the balls at the end of your turn.  The idea is that you keep the "innings", which normally means laying the court in an adventageous way for your partner ball, and that the opponent balls will be far apart, or at least wired from each other, with no short shots available.
What makes a good leave?

Your two balls close together with a useful rush
No shot shorter than 13 yards for the opponent, and no double target

What makes a great leave?

Your next turn is easier if the opponent misses than their turn is if they hit
No shot shorter than 17 yards for the opponent
Leaving some grey area - options available for the opponent to take a longer, more defensive shot
Polarity - influencing the opponent to play one ball over another, due to where it is positioned

Golden rules for making leaves
When all four balls are on the lawn, there are really two golden rules to leave-making that you should try to adhere to at all times.  Firstly, you should ensure that the very final ball you roquet in your turn should be your partner ball - this helps to organise a good rush for starting your next turn.  Secondly, you should try and ensure to always make your final hoop of the turn off an opponent's ball.  These two points are somewhat interrelated in that if you make your final hoop off the opponent, you will be roqueting it first after making the hoop, leaving partner ball "live" to be roqueted in a few strokes' time.

Diagonal Spread
The diagonal spread leave, or DSL for short, is probably the most commonly-attempted leave in croquet.  The reasons for this are that it is relatively easy to make, it is relatively forgiving if it goes horribly wrong, and doesn't leave any short shots from any baulk line.  It is a fairly hoop-agnostic leave, meaning that it is generally pretty easy to pick up a break from a DSL after a miss by the opponent, regardless of the hoop you are for.  In the example below, a DSL has been made after a break to 4-back by blue, with partner ball (black) for hoop 1.

As discussed in the golden rules above, the opponent ball is sent to 3-back (the final hoop of the turn).  Interestingly a good way to help achieve this is to organise earlier in the break to send partner to 2-back as an early pioneer after hoop 5 - if you send partner to 2-back then the 3-back pioneer will naturally be one of the opponent balls.
Before making 3-back you should organise the other opponent ball near the peg, fairly close to where you want its final position to be, and organise your partner ball 1-2 yards east of it to act as the escape ball. After making 3-back and croqueting the reception ball out towards the west boundary, you should try and rush the opponent ball by the peg into a wired spot immediately - the closer you can get it to the wired spot using a rush, the easier your job will be to wire it with the croquet stroke. Once the ball at the peg has been placed in the wired spot, you rush your escape ball (partner) out to the east boundary and lay a rush into the court for your partner ball, with both balls being wired from the ball at the peg, and ideally also wired from the ball near the west boundary.
Reverse DSL
A reverse diagonal spread is made in exactly the same way, but just organising the balls in a mirror-image, as in the diagram below.  Actually this can be quite a useful leave after a break to the peg when your partner ball is on 2-back, 3-back or 4-back as it makes picking up a break from any of these hoops fairly straightforward - certainly easier than a normal DSL.



A reverse DSL


The "B" Spread
If the diagonal spread is the most commonly-attempted leave, the "B" spread is probably the most commonly-completed leave.  Basically a "B" spread is a diagonal spread that has gone wrong when it comes to the wiring of the opponent balls at the peg.  Because the peg is narrow, the margins for error are fairly small.
Taking a step back, it is important to identify one of the most crucial parts of setting a DSL, and where a DSL is liable to go wrong - running 3-back.  Because of the distance between 3-back and the peg, it is quite important to get a forward rush out of 3-back to ensure that you are playing the crucial croquet stroke to place one oppo ball near the west boundary while approaching the other, from fairly close range.  It is very easy to lose control of the striker's ball when sending it more than a few yards in a croquet stroke and so any inaccuracies with the croquet stroke after 3-back stroke will compound in the placement of the ball near the peg. All too often, players will fail to get a rush out of 3-back, play a croquet stroke that leaves them a 2-yard roquet on the ball near the peg, and then roquet it so far out of position that they are unable to reliably croquet it back to the wired spot at the peg - this is by far the most common cause of the "B" spread.  If the ball near the peg is left open on the other opponent ball near the west boundary it generally results in leaving a 10-yard shot for the opponent.  



The difference between a DSL and a "B" spread - the image on the left shows red and yellow wired; the image on the right shows yellow is fully open on red


If you have gotten into a position whereby the opponent balls are left open across the peg, then it is worth considering not laying a rush for your partner, but instead wide-joining near corner 4, or in some cases even splitting up your balls completely, with one on the east boundary and the other in or near corner 2.
Do keep in mind that, although the "B" spread is a bad leave, a 10-yard shot still requires hitting, and it is a shot that is missed surprisingly frequently, even by strong players.  This is the advantage of attempting a diagonal spread - if it does go badly wrong and balls are left open, the opponent will still not have any shorter shot than around 10 yards. 
Backing out of a DSL
If your DSL is headed towards being a "B" spread then you have options to back out of it.  After making 3-back and sending an opponent ball towards the west boundary, it is at this point that you need to make a decision to continue with the DSL and risk a "B" spread or to back out and set an OSL - which we will look at further down this article.

Old Standard Leave
The Old Standard Leave, or OSL, was popular in earlier times, particularly in the 1960s.  Traditionally, the standard first-break tactic was to play your break to 4-back, peeling your partner through hoop 1 after 2-back, then after making 3-back to set an OSL (or "standard leave", as they were referred to at that time).  These days, the tactic of peeling partner through hoop 1 after 2-back is almost entirely extinct, as it is generally considered unhelpful - but the OSL is still a strong leave in its own right, whether partner is for H1 or H2.  The leave is very simple to make and leaves a 13-yard shot for the opponent ball at your balls in C4 from A Baulk.  There is no defensive option shot for the opponent to consider and they will have a fairly simple break pickup if they hit.

New Standard Leave
A new leave became popular in the 1990s in favour of the OSL, and is somewhat originally named the "New Standard Leave".  This leave is still one of the most popular leaves done today at the end of a break to 4-back.

There are 2 popular methods of making this leave:

With partner at 2-back - make 1-back off an opponent ball and place it near the west boundary after the hoop, then rush the other opponent ball down the court, loading it to 3-back as a pioneer; make 2-back off partner ball and get a rush to 3-back where the other opponent ball is waiting
With opponent at 2-back - make 2-back and croquet the opponent towards the west boundary while gaining a rush on partner towards 3-back where the other opponent ball is waiting

The first method has the advantage of giving good control over the placement of the west boundary ball whereas the second method has the advantage of not requiring an easterly rush out of 2-back.  Whichever method you choose, it is imperative that the 3-back pioneer is the opponent ball, because after making 3-back, the reception ball will need to be left in a very specific spot a few inches north-east of the hoop.
Placement of ball at H4
The trickiest part of setting the NSL is getting the ball at H4 accurately placed - you need to place it close enough to H4 that the ball will not have a backswing to shoot at your two balls on the east boundary.  You must also ensure that none of the ball is visible from A Baulk - even if an edge is visible it is sometimes possible for the opponent to shoot from A Baulk at a pseudo-double target with the edge of the ball at H4 and one of your balls in the background on the east boundary.  Finally, the ball must not be positioned in such a way that it does not rush to H1
In order to place the ball in the best spot, it is quite important that the approach is played from close-by and slightly south-east of the hoop. The hoop approach should ideally place the opponent ball just north of the ideal wired spot so that the hoop can be run past the reception ball and then roquet it back onto the perfect wired line - see the animation below:



Tap on the image to play the animation.


In the animation above, the grey circle indicates the ideal wired spot for red and the diagonal lines show the area which is wired from A Baulk.  It is perfectly reasonable to try and place the opponent ball in the ideal spot with the hoop approach - doing so will mean that you don't need to roquet it at all after the hoop and can instead just roquet black, leaving red where it is; but beware that trying to place red ideally in the hoop approach and leaving it short will make correcting the wiring more difficult - any roquet on a short red will only be sending it further away from the ideal spot.
Polarity
Unlike the diagonal spread, there is a certain amount of polarity in a NSL, meaning that you can influence the opponent's decision of which ball to play (or at least gain an easier break if they miss with the ball that they want to play) based on whether you place their backward or forward ball at H4 after 3-back.  This is more of an important decision in a game between stronger players who are capable of TP'ing, and also particularly in doubles this can be a critical tactical choice - for example if one of the opponents is a much weaker shot than the other, you would probably want to influence them to take the lift.
If the opponent chooses to lift their ball from H4 and take the "long" lift and misses from C3 to C4, then it is quite difficult for you to dig that ball out of C4 and into your break until you are for H4 yourself; on the other hand if the opponent lifts their ball from the west boundary and shoots from C3 to C4, it gives you the opportunity to establish a 4-ball break before you've even made H1 - you can do this by roqueting partner with your first shot, taking off to the C4 ball and playing a drive from C4, sending a pioneer to H2 while gaining a rush to H1 on the ball near H4.
Now consider that the opponent's clips are on penult and peg for example - it is highly likely in this scenario that the opponent will play their penult ball regardless of the ball positions.  Bearing this in mind, if you place the opponent's penult ball near the west boundary and their peg ball at H4, any missed lift with the penult ball will give you a greater chance at a 4-ball break and a possible TP.
A counter argument on the above scenario may be this: if the opponent (peg and penult) is bound to play their penult ball regardless of the ball positions, placing their penult ball on the west boundary may influence them to take the shorter lift shot from A Baulk instead of the longer shot from B Baulk, as they may correctly decide that missing any shot with their penult ball will give you a 4-ball break before H1.  Consider, instead, that placing the balls the "wrong" way round (peg ball on west boundary; penult ball at H4) and you may find your opponent will ultimately decide to take a longer shot with the penult ball than they may otherwise have done.  There is a balance of probabilities to be made between your expectation of the opponent hitting the long shot vs the short shot, and your reduced chances of making a game-winning break if they miss a more defensive shot into C4.

Polarity - can influence opponent to play one ball or the other

MSL (Maugham Standard Leave)
This is a variation on the NSL and was popularised by David Maugham, a leading player in the UK.  Compared to the NSL, instead of leaving a ball floating near the west boundary, after running 1-back under control you will croquet one of the opponent balls onto the middle of the west upright of H2.  In this position it cannot be rushed to H1 but acts as a perfect pioneer for H2.  As the ball at H2 is not rushable to H1, the rush is left for your partner ball to H1.



A MSL after a break by blue


This leave is more difficult to make than a NSL as it requires very good control of your break, particularly around 1-back, but there is a strong case to be made for it.  Assuming all the other clips are for H1, if the opponent lifts the ball from H4 and hits one of your balls down the east boundary from C3, then they will need to get a rush to H1 immediately.  Unless they just managed to snick the lift shot, then they are probably going to be faced with a long and difficult croquet stroke in order to obtain the rush to H1 on your other ball.
Placement of the ball at H2 after 1-back
The exact placement of the opponent ball onto the wire of H2 after running 1-back is shown in the animation below - tap on it to play.



Tap on the image to play the animation.


Blue makes 1-back off yellow with red as the escape ball for the southwards rush; partner (black) is the pioneer at 2-back.  When placing the ball on the wire of H2 after 1-back, you should endeavour to arrange the balls so that the placement is done from close range and can be done with a straight, gentle stop shot; playing this shot with any amount of split will mean that both the pace and the line will be much harder to judge.  Because you want to place the ball using a small straight stop shot, you should give some thought to the placement of the escape ball so that you will automatically gain a rush down the court on it without having to do anything with the striker's ball. 
Another advantage is that if the opponent lifts the ball from H4 and misses the long lift, you will be making H1 off partner (which is always comforting) and will have a perfect H2 pioneer.  This will pretty much guarantee that you are approaching H2 from a matter of inches away, and you can even look to get a dolly rush out of H2 towards C4 to develop the C4 ball before you have made H3.  Additionally, if you are looking at TPs, then having made H1 off partner, it will naturally be sent to H3 / 4b as a pioneer and potential peeling opportunity.
MSL summary
Advantages

Polarity - can influence opponent to play one ball or the other
You start next break by making H1 off partner
Probably the best leave for developing a standard triple opportunity
Potentially difficult break pickup for the opponent

Disadvantages

More tricky to make than a NSL or DSL
Rush to H1 from east boundary is slightly more difficult and is unlikely to be a dolly rush

Bryant Leave
This leave is named after NZ player Greg Bryant, who first started performing it regularly in 1993.  It is really the ultimate in aggressive leaves and is very difficult to make.  One ball is placed in the NSL position at H4, and the other is placed ideally about 1cm directly north of H1, or alternatively against the inside of one of the uprights, on the northern side.  Placement of this ball is difficult to get right and it is very important that none of the ball is showing through H1 on the southern side where it may be easy to hit from A Baulk.  



A Bryant Leave by blue


If you are preparing to make a Bryant Leave, then you must have an opponent ball as your 2-back pioneer.  Having a very close pioneer is important here, and you may consider placing it at 2-back from close range after H5 - ideally the pioneer will be 12 inches or less from 2-back. You should also have the other opponent ball at 1-back as the pioneer, which will naturally be sent out afterwards as the 3-back pioneer

This is the crucial part of the Bryant leave.  After making 1-back and loading the opponent ball to 3-back, you need a good rush on the pivot ball towards 2-back.  The pivot should then be placed around 1 yard east and 1 foot north of 2-back as an escape ball before you make 2-back off the opponent ball.

After 2-back, roquet the opponent reception ball back in front of 2-back as close as possible and then place it into the required position with a delicate stop shot.  After that, you can roquet your escape ball (partner) towards 3-back and make the hoop off the other opponent ball, setting it in the NSL position afterwards.
Bryant Leave summary
Advantages

Opponent has no defensive shot so any miss will give you all the balls immediately
Artificial polarity - the opponent will still be more inclined to lift the ball from H1 despite having no safe shots
If the ball placed at H4 is for H2, it can be very tough to pick up a break after hitting the lift
Looks really cool

Disadvantages

There is no grey area - opponent has no defensive shot so may as well take the shortest shot
Difficult to make

Defensive Spread
A very good, and probably under-used, leave.  This leave is great if you are the stronger player playing against a weaker player.  While it only leaves a 13-yard lift shot, it gives very poor break prospects if the lift is hit.

The leave above is one variation of the defensive spread - a mirror image of the same leave can also be made, with blue/black laid up in C4 and one opponent ball near C2 and the other peg-high on the east boundary.
The variation where blue and black are laid up in C2 is an incredibly strong leave when red is for H3 (either by breaking down or by POPs during blue's break) and yellow is for 4-back - if red hits any lift shot whatsoever, its break  prospects are slim at best; on the other hand, a miss by red gives black strong prospects of starting a second break.  Even a more defensive miss of yellow at black gives fairly good break prospects for black.
This leave is perhaps at its best on a difficult lawn where picking up breaks is more challenging, and so you do not want to gift the opponent a break with balls in the middle of the court if they happen to hit your lift.  
Defensive Spread summary
Advantages

Very strong - if the clips are right

Polarity - the opponent has aggressive and defensive lift shot options

Disadvantages

13-yard lift shot is conceded

Vertical Spread
The vertical spread is generally thought of as a second-break leave, meaning that you would look to make this leave at the end of a break to the peg, normally when your partner has well advanced clips.  It is quite common to see players make this leave when their partner ball is for 4-back, however I would not advise doing so - it can be very difficult to finish from 4-back and peg after a miss by the opponent, and there are generally better leave options available for these clips.

The Vertical Spread is actually quite easy to make, because the opponent balls can be placed from close range after running penult and rover without having to play any difficult shots.  The exact placement of the two balls at penult and rover is also not as crucial as it is when placing a ball on the back of H1 for example, because penult and rover are further from baulk.  Still, you should aim to achieve ideal position of the two opponent balls as it will give greater flexibility when deciding where to lay your own balls up at the conclusion of the turn.  The ball at penult should be placed in the front of the jaws of H6 - it is also fine to be up against one wire or the other, so long as it is on the inside of the wire and not visible from baulk, and the ball should ideally not be showing through the hoop on the non-playing side of H6.  The position for the ball at rover is essentially the same, but mirrored.
The most obvious use case for this leave is when partner (black in this case) is for penult, as it will give you an easy finishing turn from any missed lift.  Please note the diagram above has the opponent balls laid up on the east boundary, but you can just as easily lay up on the west boundary, which may enable an easier rush to penult.
You can also think of this leave as a fairly defensive leave.  If the opponent already has an advanced clip, e.g. they are for 4-back and H1, then you should try and arrange their forward ball to be the ball left south of penult. Doing this will encourage them to lift their forward ball, however if they do decide to shoot and hit with their backward ball, their break pick-up will be very difficult indeed, because the ball left in penult cannot be rushed to either H1 or H2.
Vertical spread summary
Advantages

Relatively easy to make
Very strong break prospects for your partner ball (if the clips are right)
Very poor break prospects for the opponent ball (if the clips are right)

Disadvantages

Limited value if partner clip is not for penult (or H5)

Cross-Peg
You can think of the cross-peg leave a bit like a diagonal spread, but with the west boundary ball about 12 yards further in court than normal.  The way you go about making the cross-peg is the essentially the same as that of the DSL, but after making your final hoop of the turn, you need to get a good rush to the peg where the other two balls are waiting.



A cross-peg after a break to the peg by blue


Because the rush out of your final hoop is so crucial to getting a good cross-peg, you would not frequently see this leave after a break to 4-back - making 3-back with control and a dolly rush to the peg is relatively difficult for relatively little gain in having a cross-peg instead of a DSL.  It is much more common to set this leave after running rover when your partner is for 4-back or penult.  Running rover and obtaining a dolly rush to the peg is significantly easier than the same out of 3-back, and what's more, rover is significantly closer to the peg than 3-back is.  The benefit of a cross-peg over a DSL is also more evident when for 4-back, because at the start of your next turn you will avoid the slightly tricky cross-court rushes from the east boundary to the west boundary, and also from there to 4-back.  



Tap on the image to play the animation.


The crucial thing to remember when setting the cross-peg leave (aside from the actual wiring itself) is that you should make sure the two opponent balls are placed slightly off horizontal to each other; the westerly ball should be just north of the peg and the easterly ball just south of the peg.  If this is not achieved, then it is likely that the opponent will have a 13-yard shot from somewhere on the court.

Advantages

Easy to finish from 4-back and peg after a missed lift

Disadvantages

Wiring at close range at the peg can easily go wrong
No polarity

Cross-Wire
A cross-wiring leave is where you leave both opponent balls close together at a hoop, wired from each other.  Cross-wiring can be done at any hoop, although it is not considered a lift leave - you should only plan to cross-wire if you have not made a lift hoop during your turn, otherwise the opponent will probably have a very short shot from one of the baulk lines.



Red and yellow are cross-wired at black's hoop


There is a sequence you should try to follow when making most cross-wires, which is:

Before making your final hoop, arrange one opponent ball and partner ball at the intended cross-wiring hoop
Make your final hoop off the opponent ball and gain a rush towards the cross-wiring hoop
Wire the two opponent balls at the hoop
Rush the escape ball (partner) away to a far corner

Cross-wiring opportunities
Cross-wiring is not a lift leave, so unless you are planning on laying for sextuples, most of the opportunities to do so tend to arise more by chance.  For example, if your clips are for penult and 3-back, and you hit in with your ball for penult, you can safely make your last two hoops without conceding a lift. In the example below, blue is for penult, black for 3-back; yellow has just broken down at H6 on a break.  Click the solution button below the image to see how blue might go about playing its next turn.

As you can see, the cross-wire is an incredibly strong leave and you should always be on the lookout for opportunities to make it - it will give a very long shot to your opponent, and an easy break if they miss, putting you in a very strong game position.
The (delayed) sextuple leave (or "1-back leave")
The main reasoning for playing for sextuples at all is to avoid the conceding of a lift, and so it is here where we can take advantage of cross-wiring as a standard part of a leave.  Below is a common leave seen when laying for a sextuple, leaving red and yellow the longest possible shot on the court:

To set this leave, you follow the same pattern outlined further above.  Before making hoop 6 (the final hoop of your turn), you should arrange one opponent and partner ball at hoop 1 (the cross-wiring hoop).  Make H6 with a rush back to H1 and cross-wire the opponent balls across the hoop, preferably diagonally, and gain a rush on partner ball towards C3.
The standard sextuple leave
Despite the name, this sextuple leave is rarely seen, both because it is much harder to get right, and also leaves a significantly shorter shot for the opponent.  The benefits of this leave as far as the sextuple goes is that it makes the sextuple turn a great deal easier, essentially nothing more than a quadruple peel. The standard sextuple leave is as follows:

As you can see, when setting this leave, you actually complete the cross-wiring after H5, then rush partner to H6 to score that hoop, afterwards gaining a rush to 1-back.  The reason this method is favoured for this particular leave is so that you can be rushing to 1-back from close range (near H6) instead of from near 2-back as you would have to do when performing the cross-wire after H6. Rushing to 1-back from close range helps you to obtain a good position for the jawsing of your ball in 1-back.
Polarity in cross-wiring leaves
In reality, leaving both opponent balls together (albeit wired from each other) means that there is little-to-no polarity to be had; however, there are some things you can do to still encourage one ball to play over the other.  Imagine that blue has cross-wired red and yellow at H1  (black's hoop).  Red is for 4-back and yellow is for peg, and as such, the striker of blue and black would want to  encourage yellow to play by substantially lengthening red's shot - the following leave is able to achieve this:



A 1-back leave with a degree of polarity - red is the opponent's backward ball so its shot at blue/black has been lengthened


Red is placed very near the south boundary as a deliberately poor pioneer at H1, and the length of red's shot is increased by 5-6 yards over what it would be in a normal cross-wire.  Placing red as a deliberately poor pioneer at H1 may encourage yellow to play.  Be aware, of course, that placing balls deliberately close to the boundary should only be done if you are confident of picking up a break from those positions afterwards, particularly bearing in mind that yellow may choose to corner.
Cross-wiring summary
Advantages

Ultimate distance between the opponent's balls and yours - normally 30+ yards
Gives you an easy break with a ball at your hoop if they miss

Disadvantages

No grey area - opponent is generally compelled to shoot
Not much polarity to be had
Opponent generally has an easy break if they hit (depending on clips)

Back to top

Third Turn Leaves
Generally when referring to a third-turn leave we are referring to when a player has hit on the third turn of the game and played a break to 4-back with 3 balls, then set a leave.  Bearing in mind that the fourth ball is not yet played into the game, the opponent does not have the option of which ball to play with their fourth-turn shot - they must play the remaining ball.  As such, there are opportunities to set a leave utilising the opponent's ball in close proximity to your own.
Three Ducks Leave
This leave is probably the most popular of all the third-turn leaves after a break to 4-back.



The standard Three Ducks leave after a break to 4-back by blue


The Three Ducks is so named because the balls are arranged like "ducks in a row", near the west boundary.  The best way to arrange this leave is to have your H1 ball near/on the west boundary, with the opponent ball about 1 yard further in-court and your 4-back ball another yard further in again - assuming an opponent miss, this then enables you to set an opponent ball as the H2 pioneer and take partner ball to H1 - which in turn will be sent to H3 / 4b for potential peeling opportunities later.
The Three Ducks is the most aggressive of the third-turn leaves and doesn't really leave any defensive option for the opponent.  Having said that, if the opponent takes the longer lift shot from C1 through to C2, it can be a bit tricky to dig the C2 ball out if you do not get a forward rush out of H1.  If no forward rush is achieved, you may choose to take off to C2 instead of croquet partner ball to H3.
Reverse Three Ducks Leave
A perfectly valid option, but far less frequently used.  This is a mirror image of the regular Three Ducks, although it is probably a bit more difficult to pick up a break from a missed lift.  It is easier to make than the regular Three Ducks as it doesn't require control out of 3b.



A reverse Three Ducks leave


If the opponent misses the shot from C3 to C4 there is an interesting opportunity to play a bombard on the in-lawn ball to H1 while approaching the ball in C4 - certainly it is not the kind of shot you would want to approach without having practised it, but if played successfully, gives an immediate 4-ball break.  
Third-Turn NSL
This leave is just like a regular NSL but obviously with a ball missing.  Again it's best to have your 4-back ball in the NSL position at H4, so the way you go about making this leave is slightly different than a normal NSL.



A third turn NSL by blue


After making 3-back you can rush partner out to the east boundary, then rush the opponent's ball back slightly south of 3-back.  A little stop shot is then played to send the opponent ball out towards partner while approaching the intended wired spot at H4 with striker's ball.
Another method would be to rush both partner and opponent out towards their east boundary positions, and then takeoff back to place your ball in the wired spot at H4. 
The fourth turn shot from the opponent is the exact equivalent of them lifting the ball from the west boundary and taking their lift shot.
Third-Turn Defensive Spread
The third-turn leave favoured by stronger players - this looks a lot like a DSL but with the peg ball missing.



A third-turn Defensive Spread by blue


After a fourth-turn miss from the opponent, the break pickup is similar to that of a DSL, but ideally the initial rush is left for the H1 ball on the opponent's ball, and your 4-back ball is placed on or near the west boundary. This gives the advantage of taking the rush to H1 with partner. 
When making this leave, very strong players will likely play their 4-back ball all the way to the west boundary with their final shot for blue, instead of lagging the ball a yard or two from the yardline - this adds more defence to the leave, and means that if the opponent does hit the long lift their break pick-up will be even more difficult.

Super Advanced Leaves

The Super Advanced game is a slightly modified version of association croquet that is played at championship level in England.  It incorporates an additional lift (at hoop 4) when compared to normal advanced rules, and hence changes the tactics and first-break leaves quite considerably.  As a result, all the golden rules for leave-making go out the window.  A separate article about super advanced first-break tactics and leaves is available here

Leaves
A "leave" in croquet is the culmination of the process of arranging the balls at the end of your turn.  The idea is that you keep the "innings", which normally means laying the court in an adventageous way for your partner ball, and that the opponent balls will be far apart, or at least wired from each other, with no short shots available.
What makes a good leave?

Your two balls close together with a useful rush
No shot shorter than 13 yards for the opponent, and no double target

What makes a great leave?

Your next turn is easier if the opponent misses than their turn is if they hit
No shot shorter than 17 yards for the opponent
Leaving some grey area - options available for the opponent to take a longer, more defensive shot
Polarity - influencing the opponent to play one ball over another, due to where it is positioned

Golden rules for making leaves
When all four balls are on the lawn, there are really two golden rules to leave-making that you should try to adhere to at all times.  Firstly, you should ensure that the very final ball you roquet in your turn should be your partner ball - this helps to organise a good rush for starting your next turn.  Secondly, you should try and ensure to always make your final hoop of the turn off an opponent's ball.  These two points are somewhat interrelated in that if you make your final hoop off the opponent, you will be roqueting it first after making the hoop, leaving partner ball "live" to be roqueted in a few strokes' time.

Diagonal Spread
The diagonal spread leave, or DSL for short, is probably the most commonly-attempted leave in croquet.  The reasons for this are that it is relatively easy to make, it is relatively forgiving if it goes horribly wrong, and doesn't leave any short shots from any baulk line.  It is a fairly hoop-agnostic leave, meaning that it is generally pretty easy to pick up a break from a DSL after a miss by the opponent, regardless of the hoop you are for.  In the example below, a DSL has been made after a break to 4-back by blue, with partner ball (black) for hoop 1.

As discussed in the golden rules above, the opponent ball is sent to 3-back (the final hoop of the turn).  Interestingly a good way to help achieve this is to organise earlier in the break to send partner to 2-back as an early pioneer after hoop 5 - if you send partner to 2-back then the 3-back pioneer will naturally be one of the opponent balls.
Before making 3-back you should organise the other opponent ball near the peg, fairly close to where you want its final position to be, and organise your partner ball 1-2 yards east of it to act as the escape ball. After making 3-back and croqueting the reception ball out towards the west boundary, you should try and rush the opponent ball by the peg into a wired spot immediately - the closer you can get it to the wired spot using a rush, the easier your job will be to wire it with the croquet stroke. Once the ball at the peg has been placed in the wired spot, you rush your escape ball (partner) out to the east boundary and lay a rush into the court for your partner ball, with both balls being wired from the ball at the peg, and ideally also wired from the ball near the west boundary.
Reverse DSL
A reverse diagonal spread is made in exactly the same way, but just organising the balls in a mirror-image, as in the diagram below.  Actually this can be quite a useful leave after a break to the peg when your partner ball is on 2-back, 3-back or 4-back as it makes picking up a break from any of these hoops fairly straightforward - certainly easier than a normal DSL.



A reverse DSL


The "B" Spread
If the diagonal spread is the most commonly-attempted leave, the "B" spread is probably the most commonly-completed leave.  Basically a "B" spread is a diagonal spread that has gone wrong when it comes to the wiring of the opponent balls at the peg.  Because the peg is narrow, the margins for error are fairly small.
Taking a step back, it is important to identify one of the most crucial parts of setting a DSL, and where a DSL is liable to go wrong - running 3-back.  Because of the distance between 3-back and the peg, it is quite important to get a forward rush out of 3-back to ensure that you are playing the crucial croquet stroke to place one oppo ball near the west boundary while approaching the other, from fairly close range.  It is very easy to lose control of the striker's ball when sending it more than a few yards in a croquet stroke and so any inaccuracies with the croquet stroke after 3-back stroke will compound in the placement of the ball near the peg. All too often, players will fail to get a rush out of 3-back, play a croquet stroke that leaves them a 2-yard roquet on the ball near the peg, and then roquet it so far out of position that they are unable to reliably croquet it back to the wired spot at the peg - this is by far the most common cause of the "B" spread.  If the ball near the peg is left open on the other opponent ball near the west boundary it generally results in leaving a 10-yard shot for the opponent.  



The difference between a DSL and a "B" spread - the image on the left shows red and yellow wired; the image on the right shows yellow is fully open on red


If you have gotten into a position whereby the opponent balls are left open across the peg, then it is worth considering not laying a rush for your partner, but instead wide-joining near corner 4, or in some cases even splitting up your balls completely, with one on the east boundary and the other in or near corner 2.
Do keep in mind that, although the "B" spread is a bad leave, a 10-yard shot still requires hitting, and it is a shot that is missed surprisingly frequently, even by strong players.  This is the advantage of attempting a diagonal spread - if it does go badly wrong and balls are left open, the opponent will still not have any shorter shot than around 10 yards. 
Backing out of a DSL
If your DSL is headed towards being a "B" spread then you have options to back out of it.  After making 3-back and sending an opponent ball towards the west boundary, it is at this point that you need to make a decision to continue with the DSL and risk a "B" spread or to back out and set an OSL - which we will look at further down this article.

Old Standard Leave
The Old Standard Leave, or OSL, was popular in earlier times, particularly in the 1960s.  Traditionally, the standard first-break tactic was to play your break to 4-back, peeling your partner through hoop 1 after 2-back, then after making 3-back to set an OSL (or "standard leave", as they were referred to at that time).  These days, the tactic of peeling partner through hoop 1 after 2-back is almost entirely extinct, as it is generally considered unhelpful - but the OSL is still a strong leave in its own right, whether partner is for H1 or H2.  The leave is very simple to make and leaves a 13-yard shot for the opponent ball at your balls in C4 from A Baulk.  There is no defensive option shot for the opponent to consider and they will have a fairly simple break pickup if they hit.

New Standard Leave
A new leave became popular in the 1990s in favour of the OSL, and is somewhat originally named the "New Standard Leave".  This leave is still one of the most popular leaves done today at the end of a break to 4-back.

There are 2 popular methods of making this leave:

With partner at 2-back - make 1-back off an opponent ball and place it near the west boundary after the hoop, then rush the other opponent ball down the court, loading it to 3-back as a pioneer; make 2-back off partner ball and get a rush to 3-back where the other opponent ball is waiting
With opponent at 2-back - make 2-back and croquet the opponent towards the west boundary while gaining a rush on partner towards 3-back where the other opponent ball is waiting

The first method has the advantage of giving good control over the placement of the west boundary ball whereas the second method has the advantage of not requiring an easterly rush out of 2-back.  Whichever method you choose, it is imperative that the 3-back pioneer is the opponent ball, because after making 3-back, the reception ball will need to be left in a very specific spot a few inches north-east of the hoop.
Placement of ball at H4
The trickiest part of setting the NSL is getting the ball at H4 accurately placed - you need to place it close enough to H4 that the ball will not have a backswing to shoot at your two balls on the east boundary.  You must also ensure that none of the ball is visible from A Baulk - even if an edge is visible it is sometimes possible for the opponent to shoot from A Baulk at a pseudo-double target with the edge of the ball at H4 and one of your balls in the background on the east boundary.  Finally, the ball must not be positioned in such a way that it does not rush to H1
In order to place the ball in the best spot, it is quite important that the approach is played from close-by and slightly south-east of the hoop. The hoop approach should ideally place the opponent ball just north of the ideal wired spot so that the hoop can be run past the reception ball and then roquet it back onto the perfect wired line - see the animation below:



Tap on the image to play the animation.


In the animation above, the grey circle indicates the ideal wired spot for red and the diagonal lines show the area which is wired from A Baulk.  It is perfectly reasonable to try and place the opponent ball in the ideal spot with the hoop approach - doing so will mean that you don't need to roquet it at all after the hoop and can instead just roquet black, leaving red where it is; but beware that trying to place red ideally in the hoop approach and leaving it short will make correcting the wiring more difficult - any roquet on a short red will only be sending it further away from the ideal spot.
Polarity
Unlike the diagonal spread, there is a certain amount of polarity in a NSL, meaning that you can influence the opponent's decision of which ball to play (or at least gain an easier break if they miss with the ball that they want to play) based on whether you place their backward or forward ball at H4 after 3-back.  This is more of an important decision in a game between stronger players who are capable of TP'ing, and also particularly in doubles this can be a critical tactical choice - for example if one of the opponents is a much weaker shot than the other, you would probably want to influence them to take the lift.
If the opponent chooses to lift their ball from H4 and take the "long" lift and misses from C3 to C4, then it is quite difficult for you to dig that ball out of C4 and into your break until you are for H4 yourself; on the other hand if the opponent lifts their ball from the west boundary and shoots from C3 to C4, it gives you the opportunity to establish a 4-ball break before you've even made H1 - you can do this by roqueting partner with your first shot, taking off to the C4 ball and playing a drive from C4, sending a pioneer to H2 while gaining a rush to H1 on the ball near H4.
Now consider that the opponent's clips are on penult and peg for example - it is highly likely in this scenario that the opponent will play their penult ball regardless of the ball positions.  Bearing this in mind, if you place the opponent's penult ball near the west boundary and their peg ball at H4, any missed lift with the penult ball will give you a greater chance at a 4-ball break and a possible TP.
A counter argument on the above scenario may be this: if the opponent (peg and penult) is bound to play their penult ball regardless of the ball positions, placing their penult ball on the west boundary may influence them to take the shorter lift shot from A Baulk instead of the longer shot from B Baulk, as they may correctly decide that missing any shot with their penult ball will give you a 4-ball break before H1.  Consider, instead, that placing the balls the "wrong" way round (peg ball on west boundary; penult ball at H4) and you may find your opponent will ultimately decide to take a longer shot with the penult ball than they may otherwise have done.  There is a balance of probabilities to be made between your expectation of the opponent hitting the long shot vs the short shot, and your reduced chances of making a game-winning break if they miss a more defensive shot into C4.

MSL (Maugham Standard Leave)
This is a variation on the NSL and was popularised by David Maugham, a leading player in the UK.  Compared to the NSL, instead of leaving a ball floating near the west boundary, after running 1-back under control you will croquet one of the opponent balls onto the middle of the west upright of H2.  In this position it cannot be rushed to H1 but acts as a perfect pioneer for H2.  As the ball at H2 is not rushable to H1, the rush is left for your partner ball to H1.



A MSL after a break by blue


This leave is more difficult to make than a NSL as it requires very good control of your break, particularly around 1-back, but there is a strong case to be made for it.  Assuming all the other clips are for H1, if the opponent lifts the ball from H4 and hits one of your balls down the east boundary from C3, then they will need to get a rush to H1 immediately.  Unless they just managed to snick the lift shot, then they are probably going to be faced with a long and difficult croquet stroke in order to obtain the rush to H1 on your other ball.

Blue makes 1-back off yellow with red as the escape ball for the southwards rush; partner (black) is the pioneer at 2-back.  When placing the ball on the wire of H2 after 1-back, you should endeavour to arrange the balls so that the placement is done from close range and can be done with a straight, gentle stop shot; playing this shot with any amount of split will mean that both the pace and the line will be much harder to judge.  Because you want to place the ball using a small straight stop shot, you should give some thought to the placement of the escape ball so that you will automatically gain a rush down the court on it without having to do anything with the striker's ball. 
Another advantage is that if the opponent lifts the ball from H4 and misses the long lift, you will be making H1 off partner (which is always comforting) and will have a perfect H2 pioneer.  This will pretty much guarantee that you are approaching H2 from a matter of inches away, and you can even look to get a dolly rush out of H2 towards C4 to develop the C4 ball before you have made H3.  Additionally, if you are looking at TPs, then having made H1 off partner, it will naturally be sent to H3 / 4b as a pioneer and potential peeling opportunity.
MSL summary
Advantages

Polarity - can influence opponent to play one ball or the other
You start next break by making H1 off partner
Probably the best leave for developing a standard triple opportunity
Potentially difficult break pickup for the opponent

Disadvantages

More tricky to make than a NSL or DSL
Rush to H1 from east boundary is slightly more difficult and is unlikely to be a dolly rush

Bryant Leave
This leave is named after NZ player Greg Bryant, who first started performing it regularly in 1993.  It is really the ultimate in aggressive leaves and is very difficult to make.  One ball is placed in the NSL position at H4, and the other is placed ideally about 1cm directly north of H1, or alternatively against the inside of one of the uprights, on the northern side.  Placement of this ball is difficult to get right and it is very important that none of the ball is showing through H1 on the southern side where it may be easy to hit from A Baulk.  



A Bryant Leave by blue


If you are preparing to make a Bryant Leave, then you must have an opponent ball as your 2-back pioneer.  Having a very close pioneer is important here, and you may consider placing it at 2-back from close range after H5 - ideally the pioneer will be 12 inches or less from 2-back. You should also have the other opponent ball at 1-back as the pioneer, which will naturally be sent out afterwards as the 3-back pioneer
Placement of the opponent ball at H1
This is the crucial part of the Bryant leave.  After making 1-back and loading the opponent ball to 3-back, you need a good rush on the pivot ball towards 2-back.  The pivot should then be placed around 1 yard east and 1 foot north of 2-back as an escape ball before you make 2-back off the opponent ball.



Tap on the image to play the animation.


After 2-back, roquet the opponent reception ball back in front of 2-back as close as possible and then place it into the required position with a delicate stop shot.  After that, you can roquet your escape ball (partner) towards 3-back and make the hoop off the other opponent ball, setting it in the NSL position afterwards.
Bryant Leave summary
Advantages

Opponent has no defensive shot so any miss will give you all the balls immediately
Artificial polarity - the opponent will still be more inclined to lift the ball from H1 despite having no safe shots
If the ball placed at H4 is for H2, it can be very tough to pick up a break after hitting the lift
Looks really cool

Disadvantages

There is no grey area - opponent has no defensive shot so may as well take the shortest shot
Difficult to make

Defensive Spread
A very good, and probably under-used, leave.  This leave is great if you are the stronger player playing against a weaker player.  While it only leaves a 13-yard lift shot, it gives very poor break prospects if the lift is hit.

The leave above is one variation of the defensive spread - a mirror image of the same leave can also be made, with blue/black laid up in C4 and one opponent ball near C2 and the other peg-high on the east boundary.
The variation where blue and black are laid up in C2 is an incredibly strong leave when red is for H3 (either by breaking down or by POPs during blue's break) and yellow is for 4-back - if red hits any lift shot whatsoever, its break  prospects are slim at best; on the other hand, a miss by red gives black strong prospects of starting a second break.  Even a more defensive miss of yellow at black gives fairly good break prospects for black.
This leave is perhaps at its best on a difficult lawn where picking up breaks is more challenging, and so you do not want to gift the opponent a break with balls in the middle of the court if they happen to hit your lift.  
Defensive Spread summary
Advantages

Very strong - if the clips are right
Gives very slim break prospects to your opponent if they hit the lift
Polarity - the opponent has aggressive and defensive lift shot options

Vertical Spread
The vertical spread is generally thought of as a second-break leave, meaning that you would look to make this leave at the end of a break to the peg, normally when your partner has well advanced clips.  It is quite common to see players make this leave when their partner ball is for 4-back, however I would not advise doing so - it can be very difficult to finish from 4-back and peg after a miss by the opponent, and there are generally better leave options available for these clips.

The Vertical Spread is actually quite easy to make, because the opponent balls can be placed from close range after running penult and rover without having to play any difficult shots.  The exact placement of the two balls at penult and rover is also not as crucial as it is when placing a ball on the back of H1 for example, because penult and rover are further from baulk.  Still, you should aim to achieve ideal position of the two opponent balls as it will give greater flexibility when deciding where to lay your own balls up at the conclusion of the turn.  The ball at penult should be placed in the front of the jaws of H6 - it is also fine to be up against one wire or the other, so long as it is on the inside of the wire and not visible from baulk, and the ball should ideally not be showing through the hoop on the non-playing side of H6.  The position for the ball at rover is essentially the same, but mirrored.
The most obvious use case for this leave is when partner (black in this case) is for penult, as it will give you an easy finishing turn from any missed lift.  Please note the diagram above has the opponent balls laid up on the east boundary, but you can just as easily lay up on the west boundary, which may enable an easier rush to penult.
You can also think of this leave as a fairly defensive leave.  If the opponent already has an advanced clip, e.g. they are for 4-back and H1, then you should try and arrange their forward ball to be the ball left south of penult. Doing this will encourage them to lift their forward ball, however if they do decide to shoot and hit with their backward ball, their break pick-up will be very difficult indeed, because the ball left in penult cannot be rushed to either H1 or H2.
Vertical spread summary
Advantages

Relatively easy to make
Very strong break prospects for your partner ball (if the clips are right)
Very poor break prospects for the opponent ball (if the clips are right)

Disadvantages

Limited value if partner clip is not for penult (or H5)

Cross-Peg
You can think of the cross-peg leave a bit like a diagonal spread, but with the west boundary ball about 12 yards further in court than normal.  The way you go about making the cross-peg is the essentially the same as that of the DSL, but after making your final hoop of the turn, you need to get a good rush to the peg where the other two balls are waiting.



A cross-peg after a break to the peg by blue


Because the rush out of your final hoop is so crucial to getting a good cross-peg, you would not frequently see this leave after a break to 4-back - making 3-back with control and a dolly rush to the peg is relatively difficult for relatively little gain in having a cross-peg instead of a DSL.  It is much more common to set this leave after running rover when your partner is for 4-back or penult.  Running rover and obtaining a dolly rush to the peg is significantly easier than the same out of 3-back, and what's more, rover is significantly closer to the peg than 3-back is.  The benefit of a cross-peg over a DSL is also more evident when for 4-back, because at the start of your next turn you will avoid the slightly tricky cross-court rushes from the east boundary to the west boundary, and also from there to 4-back.  



Tap on the image to play the animation.


The crucial thing to remember when setting the cross-peg leave (aside from the actual wiring itself) is that you should make sure the two opponent balls are placed slightly off horizontal to each other; the westerly ball should be just north of the peg and the easterly ball just south of the peg.  If this is not achieved, then it is likely that the opponent will have a 13-yard shot from somewhere on the court.

Advantages

Easy to finish from 4-back and peg after a missed lift

Disadvantages

Wiring at close range at the peg can easily go wrong
No polarity
Easy break pick-up if lift is hit

Cross-Wire
A cross-wiring leave is where you leave both opponent balls close together at a hoop, wired from each other.  Cross-wiring can be done at any hoop, although it is not considered a lift leave - you should only plan to cross-wire if you have not made a lift hoop during your turn, otherwise the opponent will probably have a very short shot from one of the baulk lines.



Red and yellow are cross-wired at black's hoop


There is a sequence you should try to follow when making most cross-wires, which is:

Before making your final hoop, arrange one opponent ball and partner ball at the intended cross-wiring hoop
Make your final hoop off the opponent ball and gain a rush towards the cross-wiring hoop
Wire the two opponent balls at the hoop
Rush the escape ball (partner) away to a far corner

Cross-wiring opportunities
Cross-wiring is not a lift leave, so unless you are planning on laying for sextuples, most of the opportunities to do so tend to arise more by chance.  For example, if your clips are for penult and 3-back, and you hit in with your ball for penult, you can safely make your last two hoops without conceding a lift. In the example below, blue is for penult, black for 3-back; yellow has just broken down at H6 on a break.  Click the solution button below the image to see how blue might go about playing its next turn.

As you can see, the cross-wire is an incredibly strong leave and you should always be on the lookout for opportunities to make it - it will give a very long shot to your opponent, and an easy break if they miss, putting you in a very strong game position.
The (delayed) sextuple leave (or "1-back leave")
The main reasoning for playing for sextuples at all is to avoid the conceding of a lift, and so it is here where we can take advantage of cross-wiring as a standard part of a leave.  Below is a common leave seen when laying for a sextuple, leaving red and yellow the longest possible shot on the court:  



A 1-back leave - red and yellow cross-wired at H1 with blue and black laid up near C3

To set this leave, you follow the same pattern outlined further above.  Before making hoop 6 (the final hoop of your turn), you should arrange one opponent and partner ball at hoop 1 (the cross-wiring hoop).  Make H6 with a rush back to H1 and cross-wire the opponent balls across the hoop, preferably diagonally, and gain a rush on partner ball towards C3.
The standard sextuple leave
Despite the name, this sextuple leave is rarely seen, both because it is much harder to get right, and also leaves a significantly shorter shot for the opponent.  The benefits of this leave as far as the sextuple goes is that it makes the sextuple turn a great deal easier, essentially nothing more than a quadruple peel. The standard sextuple leave is as follows:

                Click on the court to play the animation.  The action starts with blue running H4.



Close





As you can see, when setting this leave, you actually complete the cross-wiring after H5, then rush partner to H6 to score that hoop, afterwards gaining a rush to 1-back.  The reason this method is favoured for this particular leave is so that you can be rushing to 1-back from close range (near H6) instead of from near 2-back as you would have to do when performing the cross-wire after H6. Rushing to 1-back from close range helps you to obtain a good position for the jawsing of your ball in 1-back.
Polarity in cross-wiring leaves
In reality, leaving both opponent balls together (albeit wired from each other) means that there is little-to-no polarity to be had; however, there are some things you can do to still encourage one ball to play over the other.  Imagine that blue has cross-wired red and yellow at H1  (black's hoop).  Red is for 4-back and yellow is for peg, and as such, the striker of blue and black would want to  encourage yellow to play by substantially lengthening red's shot - the following leave is able to achieve this:



A 1-back leave with a degree of polarity - red is the opponent's backward ball so its shot at blue/black has been lengthened


Red is placed very near the south boundary as a deliberately poor pioneer at H1, and the length of red's shot is increased by 5-6 yards over what it would be in a normal cross-wire.  Placing red as a deliberately poor pioneer at H1 may encourage yellow to play.  Be aware, of course, that placing balls deliberately close to the boundary should only be done if you are confident of picking up a break from those positions afterwards, particularly bearing in mind that yellow may choose to corner.
Cross-wiring summary
Advantages

Ultimate distance between the opponent's balls and yours - normally 30+ yards
Gives you an easy break with a ball at your hoop if they miss

Disadvantages

No grey area - opponent is generally compelled to shoot
Not much polarity to be had
Opponent generally has an easy break if they hit (depending on clips)

Back to top

Third Turn Leaves
Generally when referring to a third-turn leave we are referring to when a player has hit on the third turn of the game and played a break to 4-back with 3 balls, then set a leave.  Bearing in mind that the fourth ball is not yet played into the game, the opponent does not have the option of which ball to play with their fourth-turn shot - they must play the remaining ball.  As such, there are opportunities to set a leave utilising the opponent's ball in close proximity to your own.
Three Ducks Leave
This leave is probably the most popular of all the third-turn leaves after a break to 4-back.



The standard Three Ducks leave after a break to 4-back by blue


The Three Ducks is so named because the balls are arranged like "ducks in a row", near the west boundary.  The best way to arrange this leave is to have your H1 ball near/on the west boundary, with the opponent ball about 1 yard further in-court and your 4-back ball another yard further in again - assuming an opponent miss, this then enables you to set an opponent ball as the H2 pioneer and take partner ball to H1 - which in turn will be sent to H3 / 4b for potential peeling opportunities later.
The Three Ducks is the most aggressive of the third-turn leaves and doesn't really leave any defensive option for the opponent.  Having said that, if the opponent takes the longer lift shot from C1 through to C2, it can be a bit tricky to dig the C2 ball out if you do not get a forward rush out of H1.  If no forward rush is achieved, you may choose to take off to C2 instead of croquet partner ball to H3.
Reverse Three Ducks Leave
A perfectly valid option, but far less frequently used.  This is a mirror image of the regular Three Ducks, although it is probably a bit more difficult to pick up a break from a missed lift.  It is easier to make than the regular Three Ducks as it doesn't require control out of 3b.



A reverse Three Ducks leave


If the opponent misses the shot from C3 to C4 there is an interesting opportunity to play a bombard on the in-lawn ball to H1 while approaching the ball in C4 - certainly it is not the kind of shot you would want to approach without having practised it, but if played successfully, gives an immediate 4-ball break.  
Third-Turn NSL
This leave is just like a regular NSL but obviously with a ball missing.  Again it's best to have your 4-back ball in the NSL position at H4, so the way you go about making this leave is slightly different than a normal NSL.



A third turn NSL by blue


After making 3-back you can rush partner out to the east boundary, then rush the opponent's ball back slightly south of 3-back.  A little stop shot is then played to send the opponent ball out towards partner while approaching the intended wired spot at H4 with striker's ball.
Another method would be to rush both partner and opponent out towards their east boundary positions, and then takeoff back to place your ball in the wired spot at H4. 
The fourth turn shot from the opponent is the exact equivalent of them lifting the ball from the west boundary and taking their lift shot.
Third-Turn Defensive Spread
The third-turn leave favoured by stronger players - this looks a lot like a DSL but with the peg ball missing.



A third-turn Defensive Spread by blue


After a fourth-turn miss from the opponent, the break pickup is similar to that of a DSL, but ideally the initial rush is left for the H1 ball on the opponent's ball, and your 4-back ball is placed on or near the west boundary. This gives the advantage of taking the rush to H1 with partner. 
When making this leave, very strong players will likely play their 4-back ball all the way to the west boundary with their final shot for blue, instead of lagging the ball a yard or two from the yardline - this adds more defence to the leave, and means that if the opponent does hit the long lift their break pick-up will be even more difficult.

Super Advanced Leaves

The Super Advanced game is a slightly modified version of association croquet that is played at championship level in England.  It incorporates an additional lift (at hoop 4) when compared to normal advanced rules, and hence changes the tactics and first-break leaves quite considerably.  As a result, all the golden rules for leave-making go out the window.  A separate article about super advanced first-break tactics and leaves is available here

Leaves
A "leave" in croquet is the culmination of the process of arranging the balls at the end of your turn.  The idea is that you keep the "innings", which normally means laying the court in an adventageous way for your partner ball, and that the opponent balls will be far apart, or at least wired from each other, with no short shots available.
What makes a good leave?

Your two balls close together with a useful rush
No shot shorter than 13 yards for the opponent, and no double target

What makes a great leave?

Your next turn is easier if the opponent misses than their turn is if they hit
No shot shorter than 17 yards for the opponent
Leaving some grey area - options available for the opponent to take a longer, more defensive shot
Polarity - influencing the opponent to play one ball over another, due to where it is positioned

Golden rules for making leaves
When all four balls are on the lawn, there are really two golden rules to leave-making that you should try to adhere to at all times.  Firstly, you should ensure that the very final ball you roquet in your turn should be your partner ball - this helps to organise a good rush for starting your next turn.  Secondly, you should try and ensure to always make your final hoop of the turn off an opponent's ball.  These two points are somewhat interrelated in that if you make your final hoop off the opponent, you will be roqueting it first after making the hoop, leaving partner ball "live" to be roqueted in a few strokes' time.

Diagonal Spread
The diagonal spread leave, or DSL for short, is probably the most commonly-attempted leave in croquet.  The reasons for this are that it is relatively easy to make, it is relatively forgiving if it goes horribly wrong, and doesn't leave any short shots from any baulk line.  It is a fairly hoop-agnostic leave, meaning that it is generally pretty easy to pick up a break from a DSL after a miss by the opponent, regardless of the hoop you are for.  In the example below, a DSL has been made after a break to 4-back by blue, with partner ball (black) for hoop 1.

As discussed in the golden rules above, the opponent ball is sent to 3-back (the final hoop of the turn).  Interestingly a good way to help achieve this is to organise earlier in the break to send partner to 2-back as an early pioneer after hoop 5 - if you send partner to 2-back then the 3-back pioneer will naturally be one of the opponent balls.
Before making 3-back you should organise the other opponent ball near the peg, fairly close to where you want its final position to be, and organise your partner ball 1-2 yards east of it to act as the escape ball. After making 3-back and croqueting the reception ball out towards the west boundary, you should try and rush the opponent ball by the peg into a wired spot immediately - the closer you can get it to the wired spot using a rush, the easier your job will be to wire it with the croquet stroke. Once the ball at the peg has been placed in the wired spot, you rush your escape ball (partner) out to the east boundary and lay a rush into the court for your partner ball, with both balls being wired from the ball at the peg, and ideally also wired from the ball near the west boundary.
Reverse DSL
A reverse diagonal spread is made in exactly the same way, but just organising the balls in a mirror-image, as in the diagram below.  Actually this can be quite a useful leave after a break to the peg when your partner ball is on 2-back, 3-back or 4-back as it makes picking up a break from any of these hoops fairly straightforward - certainly easier than a normal DSL.



A reverse DSL


The "B" Spread
If the diagonal spread is the most commonly-attempted leave, the "B" spread is probably the most commonly-completed leave.  Basically a "B" spread is a diagonal spread that has gone wrong when it comes to the wiring of the opponent balls at the peg.  Because the peg is narrow, the margins for error are fairly small.
Taking a step back, it is important to identify one of the most crucial parts of setting a DSL, and where a DSL is liable to go wrong - running 3-back.  Because of the distance between 3-back and the peg, it is quite important to get a forward rush out of 3-back to ensure that you are playing the crucial croquet stroke to place one oppo ball near the west boundary while approaching the other, from fairly close range.  It is very easy to lose control of the striker's ball when sending it more than a few yards in a croquet stroke and so any inaccuracies with the croquet stroke after 3-back stroke will compound in the placement of the ball near the peg. All too often, players will fail to get a rush out of 3-back, play a croquet stroke that leaves them a 2-yard roquet on the ball near the peg, and then roquet it so far out of position that they are unable to reliably croquet it back to the wired spot at the peg - this is by far the most common cause of the "B" spread.  If the ball near the peg is left open on the other opponent ball near the west boundary it generally results in leaving a 10-yard shot for the opponent.  



The difference between a DSL and a "B" spread - the image on the left shows red and yellow wired; the image on the right shows yellow is fully open on red


If you have gotten into a position whereby the opponent balls are left open across the peg, then it is worth considering not laying a rush for your partner, but instead wide-joining near corner 4, or in some cases even splitting up your balls completely, with one on the east boundary and the other in or near corner 2.
Do keep in mind that, although the "B" spread is a bad leave, a 10-yard shot still requires hitting, and it is a shot that is missed surprisingly frequently, even by strong players.  This is the advantage of attempting a diagonal spread - if it does go badly wrong and balls are left open, the opponent will still not have any shorter shot than around 10 yards. 
Backing out of a DSL
If your DSL is headed towards being a "B" spread then you have options to back out of it.  After making 3-back and sending an opponent ball towards the west boundary, it is at this point that you need to make a decision to continue with the DSL and risk a "B" spread or to back out and set an OSL - which we will look at further down this article.

Old Standard Leave
The Old Standard Leave, or OSL, was popular in earlier times, particularly in the 1960s.  Traditionally, the standard first-break tactic was to play your break to 4-back, peeling your partner through hoop 1 after 2-back, then after making 3-back to set an OSL (or "standard leave", as they were referred to at that time).  These days, the tactic of peeling partner through hoop 1 after 2-back is almost entirely extinct, as it is generally considered unhelpful - but the OSL is still a strong leave in its own right, whether partner is for H1 or H2.  The leave is very simple to make and leaves a 13-yard shot for the opponent ball at your balls in C4 from A Baulk.  There is no defensive option shot for the opponent to consider and they will have a fairly simple break pickup if they hit.

New Standard Leave
A new leave became popular in the 1990s in favour of the OSL, and is somewhat originally named the "New Standard Leave".  This leave is still one of the most popular leaves done today at the end of a break to 4-back.

There are 2 popular methods of making this leave:

With partner at 2-back - make 1-back off an opponent ball and place it near the west boundary after the hoop, then rush the other opponent ball down the court, loading it to 3-back as a pioneer; make 2-back off partner ball and get a rush to 3-back where the other opponent ball is waiting
With opponent at 2-back - make 2-back and croquet the opponent towards the west boundary while gaining a rush on partner towards 3-back where the other opponent ball is waiting

The first method has the advantage of giving good control over the placement of the west boundary ball whereas the second method has the advantage of not requiring an easterly rush out of 2-back.  Whichever method you choose, it is imperative that the 3-back pioneer is the opponent ball, because after making 3-back, the reception ball will need to be left in a very specific spot a few inches north-east of the hoop.
Placement of ball at H4
The trickiest part of setting the NSL is getting the ball at H4 accurately placed - you need to place it close enough to H4 that the ball will not have a backswing to shoot at your two balls on the east boundary.  You must also ensure that none of the ball is visible from A Baulk - even if an edge is visible it is sometimes possible for the opponent to shoot from A Baulk at a pseudo-double target with the edge of the ball at H4 and one of your balls in the background on the east boundary.  Finally, the ball must not be positioned in such a way that it does not rush to H1
In order to place the ball in the best spot, it is quite important that the approach is played from close-by and slightly south-east of the hoop. The hoop approach should ideally place the opponent ball just north of the ideal wired spot so that the hoop can be run past the reception ball and then roquet it back onto the perfect wired line - see the animation below:



Tap on the image to play the animation.


In the animation above, the grey circle indicates the ideal wired spot for red and the diagonal lines show the area which is wired from A Baulk.  It is perfectly reasonable to try and place the opponent ball in the ideal spot with the hoop approach - doing so will mean that you don't need to roquet it at all after the hoop and can instead just roquet black, leaving red where it is; but beware that trying to place red ideally in the hoop approach and leaving it short will make correcting the wiring more difficult - any roquet on a short red will only be sending it further away from the ideal spot.
Polarity
Unlike the diagonal spread, there is a certain amount of polarity in a NSL, meaning that you can influence the opponent's decision of which ball to play (or at least gain an easier break if they miss with the ball that they want to play) based on whether you place their backward or forward ball at H4 after 3-back.  This is more of an important decision in a game between stronger players who are capable of TP'ing, and also particularly in doubles this can be a critical tactical choice - for example if one of the opponents is a much weaker shot than the other, you would probably want to influence them to take the lift.
If the opponent chooses to lift their ball from H4 and take the "long" lift and misses from C3 to C4, then it is quite difficult for you to dig that ball out of C4 and into your break until you are for H4 yourself; on the other hand if the opponent lifts their ball from the west boundary and shoots from C3 to C4, it gives you the opportunity to establish a 4-ball break before you've even made H1 - you can do this by roqueting partner with your first shot, taking off to the C4 ball and playing a drive from C4, sending a pioneer to H2 while gaining a rush to H1 on the ball near H4.
Now consider that the opponent's clips are on penult and peg for example - it is highly likely in this scenario that the opponent will play their penult ball regardless of the ball positions.  Bearing this in mind, if you place the opponent's penult ball near the west boundary and their peg ball at H4, any missed lift with the penult ball will give you a greater chance at a 4-ball break and a possible TP.
A counter argument on the above scenario may be this: if the opponent (peg and penult) is bound to play their penult ball regardless of the ball positions, placing their penult ball on the west boundary may influence them to take the shorter lift shot from A Baulk instead of the longer shot from B Baulk, as they may correctly decide that missing any shot with their penult ball will give you a 4-ball break before H1.  Consider, instead, that placing the balls the "wrong" way round (peg ball on west boundary; penult ball at H4) and you may find your opponent will ultimately decide to take a longer shot with the penult ball than they may otherwise have done.  There is a balance of probabilities to be made between your expectation of the opponent hitting the long shot vs the short shot, and your reduced chances of making a game-winning break if they miss a more defensive shot into C4.

MSL (Maugham Standard Leave)
This is a variation on the NSL and was popularised by David Maugham, a leading player in the UK.  Compared to the NSL, instead of leaving a ball floating near the west boundary, after running 1-back under control you will croquet one of the opponent balls onto the middle of the west upright of H2.  In this position it cannot be rushed to H1 but acts as a perfect pioneer for H2.  As the ball at H2 is not rushable to H1, the rush is left for your partner ball to H1.



A MSL after a break by blue


This leave is more difficult to make than a NSL as it requires very good control of your break, particularly around 1-back, but there is a strong case to be made for it.  Assuming all the other clips are for H1, if the opponent lifts the ball from H4 and hits one of your balls down the east boundary from C3, then they will need to get a rush to H1 immediately.  Unless they just managed to snick the lift shot, then they are probably going to be faced with a long and difficult croquet stroke in order to obtain the rush to H1 on your other ball.
Placement of the ball at H2 after 1-back
The exact placement of the opponent ball onto the wire of H2 after running 1-back is shown in the animation below - tap on it to play.



Tap on the image to play the animation.


Blue makes 1-back off yellow with red as the escape ball for the southwards rush; partner (black) is the pioneer at 2-back.  When placing the ball on the wire of H2 after 1-back, you should endeavour to arrange the balls so that the placement is done from close range and can be done with a straight, gentle stop shot; playing this shot with any amount of split will mean that both the pace and the line will be much harder to judge.  Because you want to place the ball using a small straight stop shot, you should give some thought to the placement of the escape ball so that you will automatically gain a rush down the court on it without having to do anything with the striker's ball. 
Another advantage is that if the opponent lifts the ball from H4 and misses the long lift, you will be making H1 off partner (which is always comforting) and will have a perfect H2 pioneer.  This will pretty much guarantee that you are approaching H2 from a matter of inches away, and you can even look to get a dolly rush out of H2 towards C4 to develop the C4 ball before you have made H3.  Additionally, if you are looking at TPs, then having made H1 off partner, it will naturally be sent to H3 / 4b as a pioneer and potential peeling opportunity.
MSL summary
Advantages

Polarity - can influence opponent to play one ball or the other
You start next break by making H1 off partner
Probably the best leave for developing a standard triple opportunity
Potentially difficult break pickup for the opponent

Disadvantages

More tricky to make than a NSL or DSL
Rush to H1 from east boundary is slightly more difficult and is unlikely to be a dolly rush

Bryant Leave
This leave is named after NZ player Greg Bryant, who first started performing it regularly in 1993.  It is really the ultimate in aggressive leaves and is very difficult to make.  One ball is placed in the NSL position at H4, and the other is placed ideally about 1cm directly north of H1, or alternatively against the inside of one of the uprights, on the northern side.  Placement of this ball is difficult to get right and it is very important that none of the ball is showing through H1 on the southern side where it may be easy to hit from A Baulk.  



A Bryant Leave by blue


If you are preparing to make a Bryant Leave, then you must have an opponent ball as your 2-back pioneer.  Having a very close pioneer is important here, and you may consider placing it at 2-back from close range after H5 - ideally the pioneer will be 12 inches or less from 2-back. You should also have the other opponent ball at 1-back as the pioneer, which will naturally be sent out afterwards as the 3-back pioneer
Placement of the opponent ball at H1
This is the crucial part of the Bryant leave.  After making 1-back and loading the opponent ball to 3-back, you need a good rush on the pivot ball towards 2-back.  The pivot should then be placed around 1 yard east and 1 foot north of 2-back as an escape ball before you make 2-back off the opponent ball.



Tap on the image to play the animation.


After 2-back, roquet the opponent reception ball back in front of 2-back as close as possible and then place it into the required position with a delicate stop shot.  After that, you can roquet your escape ball (partner) towards 3-back and make the hoop off the other opponent ball, setting it in the NSL position afterwards.
Bryant Leave summary
Advantages

Opponent has no defensive shot so any miss will give you all the balls immediately
Artificial polarity - the opponent will still be more inclined to lift the ball from H1 despite having no safe shots
If the ball placed at H4 is for H2, it can be very tough to pick up a break after hitting the lift
Looks really cool

Disadvantages

There is no grey area - opponent has no defensive shot so may as well take the shortest shot
Difficult to make

Defensive Spread
A very good, and probably under-used, leave.  This leave is great if you are the stronger player playing against a weaker player.  While it only leaves a 13-yard lift shot, it gives very poor break prospects if the lift is hit.

The leave above is one variation of the defensive spread - a mirror image of the same leave can also be made, with blue/black laid up in C4 and one opponent ball near C2 and the other peg-high on the east boundary.
The variation where blue and black are laid up in C2 is an incredibly strong leave when red is for H3 (either by breaking down or by POPs during blue's break) and yellow is for 4-back - if red hits any lift shot whatsoever, its break  prospects are slim at best; on the other hand, a miss by red gives black strong prospects of starting a second break.  Even a more defensive miss of yellow at black gives fairly good break prospects for black.
This leave is perhaps at its best on a difficult lawn where picking up breaks is more challenging, and so you do not want to gift the opponent a break with balls in the middle of the court if they happen to hit your lift.  
Defensive Spread summary
Advantages

Very strong - if the clips are right
Gives very slim break prospects to your opponent if they hit the lift
Polarity - the opponent has aggressive and defensive lift shot options

Disadvantages

13-yard lift shot is conceded

Vertical Spread
The vertical spread is generally thought of as a second-break leave, meaning that you would look to make this leave at the end of a break to the peg, normally when your partner has well advanced clips.  It is quite common to see players make this leave when their partner ball is for 4-back, however I would not advise doing so - it can be very difficult to finish from 4-back and peg after a miss by the opponent, and there are generally better leave options available for these clips.

The Vertical Spread is actually quite easy to make, because the opponent balls can be placed from close range after running penult and rover without having to play any difficult shots.  The exact placement of the two balls at penult and rover is also not as crucial as it is when placing a ball on the back of H1 for example, because penult and rover are further from baulk.  Still, you should aim to achieve ideal position of the two opponent balls as it will give greater flexibility when deciding where to lay your own balls up at the conclusion of the turn.  The ball at penult should be placed in the front of the jaws of H6 - it is also fine to be up against one wire or the other, so long as it is on the inside of the wire and not visible from baulk, and the ball should ideally not be showing through the hoop on the non-playing side of H6.  The position for the ball at rover is essentially the same, but mirrored.
The most obvious use case for this leave is when partner (black in this case) is for penult, as it will give you an easy finishing turn from any missed lift.  Please note the diagram above has the opponent balls laid up on the east boundary, but you can just as easily lay up on the west boundary, which may enable an easier rush to penult.
You can also think of this leave as a fairly defensive leave.  If the opponent already has an advanced clip, e.g. they are for 4-back and H1, then you should try and arrange their forward ball to be the ball left south of penult. Doing this will encourage them to lift their forward ball, however if they do decide to shoot and hit with their backward ball, their break pick-up will be very difficult indeed, because the ball left in penult cannot be rushed to either H1 or H2.
Vertical spread summary
Advantages

Relatively easy to make
Very strong break prospects for your partner ball (if the clips are right)
Very poor break prospects for the opponent ball (if the clips are right)

Disadvantages

Limited value if partner clip is not for penult (or H5)

Cross-Peg
You can think of the cross-peg leave a bit like a diagonal spread, but with the west boundary ball about 12 yards further in court than normal.  The way you go about making the cross-peg is the essentially the same as that of the DSL, but after making your final hoop of the turn, you need to get a good rush to the peg where the other two balls are waiting.



A cross-peg after a break to the peg by blue


Because the rush out of your final hoop is so crucial to getting a good cross-peg, you would not frequently see this leave after a break to 4-back - making 3-back with control and a dolly rush to the peg is relatively difficult for relatively little gain in having a cross-peg instead of a DSL.  It is much more common to set this leave after running rover when your partner is for 4-back or penult.  Running rover and obtaining a dolly rush to the peg is significantly easier than the same out of 3-back, and what's more, rover is significantly closer to the peg than 3-back is.  The benefit of a cross-peg over a DSL is also more evident when for 4-back, because at the start of your next turn you will avoid the slightly tricky cross-court rushes from the east boundary to the west boundary, and also from there to 4-back.  



Tap on the image to play the animation.


The crucial thing to remember when setting the cross-peg leave (aside from the actual wiring itself) is that you should make sure the two opponent balls are placed slightly off horizontal to each other; the westerly ball should be just north of the peg and the easterly ball just south of the peg.  If this is not achieved, then it is likely that the opponent will have a 13-yard shot from somewhere on the court.

Advantages

Easy to finish from 4-back and peg after a missed lift

Disadvantages

Wiring at close range at the peg can easily go wrong
No polarity
Easy break pick-up if lift is hit

Cross-Wire
A cross-wiring leave is where you leave both opponent balls close together at a hoop, wired from each other.  Cross-wiring can be done at any hoop, although it is not considered a lift leave - you should only plan to cross-wire if you have not made a lift hoop during your turn, otherwise the opponent will probably have a very short shot from one of the baulk lines.



Red and yellow are cross-wired at black's hoop


There is a sequence you should try to follow when making most cross-wires, which is:

Before making your final hoop, arrange one opponent ball and partner ball at the intended cross-wiring hoop
Make your final hoop off the opponent ball and gain a rush towards the cross-wiring hoop
Wire the two opponent balls at the hoop
Rush the escape ball (partner) away to a far corner

Cross-wiring opportunities
Cross-wiring is not a lift leave, so unless you are planning on laying for sextuples, most of the opportunities to do so tend to arise more by chance.  For example, if your clips are for penult and 3-back, and you hit in with your ball for penult, you can safely make your last two hoops without conceding a lift. In the example below, blue is for penult, black for 3-back; yellow has just broken down at H6 on a break.  Click the solution button below the image to see how blue might go about playing its next turn.

As you can see, the cross-wire is an incredibly strong leave and you should always be on the lookout for opportunities to make it - it will give a very long shot to your opponent, and an easy break if they miss, putting you in a very strong game position.
The (delayed) sextuple leave (or "1-back leave")
The main reasoning for playing for sextuples at all is to avoid the conceding of a lift, and so it is here where we can take advantage of cross-wiring as a standard part of a leave.  Below is a common leave seen when laying for a sextuple, leaving red and yellow the longest possible shot on the court:  



A 1-back leave - red and yellow cross-wired at H1 with blue and black laid up near C3

To set this leave, you follow the same pattern outlined further above.  Before making hoop 6 (the final hoop of your turn), you should arrange one opponent and partner ball at hoop 1 (the cross-wiring hoop).  Make H6 with a rush back to H1 and cross-wire the opponent balls across the hoop, preferably diagonally, and gain a rush on partner ball towards C3.
The standard sextuple leave
Despite the name, this sextuple leave is rarely seen, both because it is much harder to get right, and also leaves a significantly shorter shot for the opponent.  The benefits of this leave as far as the sextuple goes is that it makes the sextuple turn a great deal easier, essentially nothing more than a quadruple peel. The standard sextuple leave is as follows:

                Click on the court to play the animation.  The action starts with blue running H4.

As you can see, when setting this leave, you actually complete the cross-wiring after H5, then rush partner to H6 to score that hoop, afterwards gaining a rush to 1-back.  The reason this method is favoured for this particular leave is so that you can be rushing to 1-back from close range (near H6) instead of from near 2-back as you would have to do when performing the cross-wire after H6. Rushing to 1-back from close range helps you to obtain a good position for the jawsing of your ball in 1-back.
Polarity in cross-wiring leaves
In reality, leaving both opponent balls together (albeit wired from each other) means that there is little-to-no polarity to be had; however, there are some things you can do to still encourage one ball to play over the other.  Imagine that blue has cross-wired red and yellow at H1  (black's hoop).  Red is for 4-back and yellow is for peg, and as such, the striker of blue and black would want to  encourage yellow to play by substantially lengthening red's shot - the following leave is able to achieve this:



A 1-back leave with a degree of polarity - red is the opponent's backward ball so its shot at blue/black has been lengthened


Red is placed very near the south boundary as a deliberately poor pioneer at H1, and the length of red's shot is increased by 5-6 yards over what it would be in a normal cross-wire.  Placing red as a deliberately poor pioneer at H1 may encourage yellow to play.  Be aware, of course, that placing balls deliberately close to the boundary should only be done if you are confident of picking up a break from those positions afterwards, particularly bearing in mind that yellow may choose to corner.
Cross-wiring summary
Advantages

Ultimate distance between the opponent's balls and yours - normally 30+ yards
Gives you an easy break with a ball at your hoop if they miss

Disadvantages

No grey area - opponent is generally compelled to shoot
Not much polarity to be had
Opponent generally has an easy break if they hit (depending on clips)

Back to top

Third Turn Leaves
Generally when referring to a third-turn leave we are referring to when a player has hit on the third turn of the game and played a break to 4-back with 3 balls, then set a leave.  Bearing in mind that the fourth ball is not yet played into the game, the opponent does not have the option of which ball to play with their fourth-turn shot - they must play the remaining ball.  As such, there are opportunities to set a leave utilising the opponent's ball in close proximity to your own.
Three Ducks Leave
This leave is probably the most popular of all the third-turn leaves after a break to 4-back.



The standard Three Ducks leave after a break to 4-back by blue


The Three Ducks is so named because the balls are arranged like "ducks in a row", near the west boundary.  The best way to arrange this leave is to have your H1 ball near/on the west boundary, with the opponent ball about 1 yard further in-court and your 4-back ball another yard further in again - assuming an opponent miss, this then enables you to set an opponent ball as the H2 pioneer and take partner ball to H1 - which in turn will be sent to H3 / 4b for potential peeling opportunities later.
The Three Ducks is the most aggressive of the third-turn leaves and doesn't really leave any defensive option for the opponent.  Having said that, if the opponent takes the longer lift shot from C1 through to C2, it can be a bit tricky to dig the C2 ball out if you do not get a forward rush out of H1.  If no forward rush is achieved, you may choose to take off to C2 instead of croquet partner ball to H3.
Reverse Three Ducks Leave
A perfectly valid option, but far less frequently used.  This is a mirror image of the regular Three Ducks, although it is probably a bit more difficult to pick up a break from a missed lift.  It is easier to make than the regular Three Ducks as it doesn't require control out of 3b.



A reverse Three Ducks leave


If the opponent misses the shot from C3 to C4 there is an interesting opportunity to play a bombard on the in-lawn ball to H1 while approaching the ball in C4 - certainly it is not the kind of shot you would want to approach without having practised it, but if played successfully, gives an immediate 4-ball break.  
Third-Turn NSL
This leave is just like a regular NSL but obviously with a ball missing.  Again it's best to have your 4-back ball in the NSL position at H4, so the way you go about making this leave is slightly different than a normal NSL.



A third turn NSL by blue


After making 3-back you can rush partner out to the east boundary, then rush the opponent's ball back slightly south of 3-back.  A little stop shot is then played to send the opponent ball out towards partner while approaching the intended wired spot at H4 with striker's ball.
Another method would be to rush both partner and opponent out towards their east boundary positions, and then takeoff back to place your ball in the wired spot at H4. 
The fourth turn shot from the opponent is the exact equivalent of them lifting the ball from the west boundary and taking their lift shot.
Third-Turn Defensive Spread
The third-turn leave favoured by stronger players - this looks a lot like a DSL but with the peg ball missing.



A third-turn Defensive Spread by blue


After a fourth-turn miss from the opponent, the break pickup is similar to that of a DSL, but ideally the initial rush is left for the H1 ball on the opponent's ball, and your 4-back ball is placed on or near the west boundary. This gives the advantage of taking the rush to H1 with partner. 
When making this leave, very strong players will likely play their 4-back ball all the way to the west boundary with their final shot for blue, instead of lagging the ball a yard or two from the yardline - this adds more defence to the leave, and means that if the opponent does hit the long lift their break pick-up will be even more difficult.

Super Advanced Leaves

The Super Advanced game is a slightly modified version of association croquet that is played at championship level in England.  It incorporates an additional lift (at hoop 4) when compared to normal advanced rules, and hence changes the tactics and first-break leaves quite considerably.  As a result, all the golden rules for leave-making go out the window.  A separate article about super advanced first-break tactics and leaves is available here

Leaves
A "leave" in croquet is the culmination of the process of arranging the balls at the end of your turn.  The idea is that you keep the "innings", which normally means laying the court in an adventageous way for your partner ball, and that the opponent balls will be far apart, or at least wired from each other, with no short shots available.
What makes a good leave?

Your two balls close together with a useful rush
No shot shorter than 13 yards for the opponent, and no double target

What makes a great leave?

Your next turn is easier if the opponent misses than their turn is if they hit
No shot shorter than 17 yards for the opponent
Leaving some grey area - options available for the opponent to take a longer, more defensive shot
Polarity - influencing the opponent to play one ball over another, due to where it is positioned

Golden rules for making leaves
When all four balls are on the lawn, there are really two golden rules to leave-making that you should try to adhere to at all times.  Firstly, you should ensure that the very final ball you roquet in your turn should be your partner ball - this helps to organise a good rush for starting your next turn.  Secondly, you should try and ensure to always make your final hoop of the turn off an opponent's ball.  These two points are somewhat interrelated in that if you make your final hoop off the opponent, you will be roqueting it first after making the hoop, leaving partner ball "live" to be roqueted in a few strokes' time.

Diagonal Spread
The diagonal spread leave, or DSL for short, is probably the most commonly-attempted leave in croquet.  The reasons for this are that it is relatively easy to make, it is relatively forgiving if it goes horribly wrong, and doesn't leave any short shots from any baulk line.  It is a fairly hoop-agnostic leave, meaning that it is generally pretty easy to pick up a break from a DSL after a miss by the opponent, regardless of the hoop you are for.  In the example below, a DSL has been made after a break to 4-back by blue, with partner ball (black) for hoop 1.

As discussed in the golden rules above, the opponent ball is sent to 3-back (the final hoop of the turn).  Interestingly a good way to help achieve this is to organise earlier in the break to send partner to 2-back as an early pioneer after hoop 5 - if you send partner to 2-back then the 3-back pioneer will naturally be one of the opponent balls.
Before making 3-back you should organise the other opponent ball near the peg, fairly close to where you want its final position to be, and organise your partner ball 1-2 yards east of it to act as the escape ball. After making 3-back and croqueting the reception ball out towards the west boundary, you should try and rush the opponent ball by the peg into a wired spot immediately - the closer you can get it to the wired spot using a rush, the easier your job will be to wire it with the croquet stroke. Once the ball at the peg has been placed in the wired spot, you rush your escape ball (partner) out to the east boundary and lay a rush into the court for your partner ball, with both balls being wired from the ball at the peg, and ideally also wired from the ball near the west boundary.
Reverse DSL
A reverse diagonal spread is made in exactly the same way, but just organising the balls in a mirror-image, as in the diagram below.  Actually this can be quite a useful leave after a break to the peg when your partner ball is on 2-back, 3-back or 4-back as it makes picking up a break from any of these hoops fairly straightforward - certainly easier than a normal DSL.



A reverse DSL


The "B" Spread
If the diagonal spread is the most commonly-attempted leave, the "B" spread is probably the most commonly-completed leave.  Basically a "B" spread is a diagonal spread that has gone wrong when it comes to the wiring of the opponent balls at the peg.  Because the peg is narrow, the margins for error are fairly small.
Taking a step back, it is important to identify one of the most crucial parts of setting a DSL, and where a DSL is liable to go wrong - running 3-back.  Because of the distance between 3-back and the peg, it is quite important to get a forward rush out of 3-back to ensure that you are playing the crucial croquet stroke to place one oppo ball near the west boundary while approaching the other, from fairly close range.  It is very easy to lose control of the striker's ball when sending it more than a few yards in a croquet stroke and so any inaccuracies with the croquet stroke after 3-back stroke will compound in the placement of the ball near the peg. All too often, players will fail to get a rush out of 3-back, play a croquet stroke that leaves them a 2-yard roquet on the ball near the peg, and then roquet it so far out of position that they are unable to reliably croquet it back to the wired spot at the peg - this is by far the most common cause of the "B" spread.  If the ball near the peg is left open on the other opponent ball near the west boundary it generally results in leaving a 10-yard shot for the opponent.  



The difference between a DSL and a "B" spread - the image on the left shows red and yellow wired; the image on the right shows yellow is fully open on red


If you have gotten into a position whereby the opponent balls are left open across the peg, then it is worth considering not laying a rush for your partner, but instead wide-joining near corner 4, or in some cases even splitting up your balls completely, with one on the east boundary and the other in or near corner 2.
Do keep in mind that, although the "B" spread is a bad leave, a 10-yard shot still requires hitting, and it is a shot that is missed surprisingly frequently, even by strong players.  This is the advantage of attempting a diagonal spread - if it does go badly wrong and balls are left open, the opponent will still not have any shorter shot than around 10 yards. 
Backing out of a DSL
If your DSL is headed towards being a "B" spread then you have options to back out of it.  After making 3-back and sending an opponent ball towards the west boundary, it is at this point that you need to make a decision to continue with the DSL and risk a "B" spread or to back out and set an OSL - which we will look at further down this article.

Old Standard Leave
The Old Standard Leave, or OSL, was popular in earlier times, particularly in the 1960s.  Traditionally, the standard first-break tactic was to play your break to 4-back, peeling your partner through hoop 1 after 2-back, then after making 3-back to set an OSL (or "standard leave", as they were referred to at that time).  These days, the tactic of peeling partner through hoop 1 after 2-back is almost entirely extinct, as it is generally considered unhelpful - but the OSL is still a strong leave in its own right, whether partner is for H1 or H2.  The leave is very simple to make and leaves a 13-yard shot for the opponent ball at your balls in C4 from A Baulk.  There is no defensive option shot for the opponent to consider and they will have a fairly simple break pickup if they hit.

New Standard Leave
A new leave became popular in the 1990s in favour of the OSL, and is somewhat originally named the "New Standard Leave".  This leave is still one of the most popular leaves done today at the end of a break to 4-back.

There are 2 popular methods of making this leave:

With partner at 2-back - make 1-back off an opponent ball and place it near the west boundary after the hoop, then rush the other opponent ball down the court, loading it to 3-back as a pioneer; make 2-back off partner ball and get a rush to 3-back where the other opponent ball is waiting
With opponent at 2-back - make 2-back and croquet the opponent towards the west boundary while gaining a rush on partner towards 3-back where the other opponent ball is waiting

The first method has the advantage of giving good control over the placement of the west boundary ball whereas the second method has the advantage of not requiring an easterly rush out of 2-back.  Whichever method you choose, it is imperative that the 3-back pioneer is the opponent ball, because after making 3-back, the reception ball will need to be left in a very specific spot a few inches north-east of the hoop.
Placement of ball at H4
The trickiest part of setting the NSL is getting the ball at H4 accurately placed - you need to place it close enough to H4 that the ball will not have a backswing to shoot at your two balls on the east boundary.  You must also ensure that none of the ball is visible from A Baulk - even if an edge is visible it is sometimes possible for the opponent to shoot from A Baulk at a pseudo-double target with the edge of the ball at H4 and one of your balls in the background on the east boundary.  Finally, the ball must not be positioned in such a way that it does not rush to H1
In order to place the ball in the best spot, it is quite important that the approach is played from close-by and slightly south-east of the hoop. The hoop approach should ideally place the opponent ball just north of the ideal wired spot so that the hoop can be run past the reception ball and then roquet it back onto the perfect wired line - see the animation below:

In the animation above, the grey circle indicates the ideal wired spot for red and the diagonal lines show the area which is wired from A Baulk.  It is perfectly reasonable to try and place the opponent ball in the ideal spot with the hoop approach - doing so will mean that you don't need to roquet it at all after the hoop and can instead just roquet black, leaving red where it is; but beware that trying to place red ideally in the hoop approach and leaving it short will make correcting the wiring more difficult - any roquet on a short red will only be sending it further away from the ideal spot.
Polarity
Unlike the diagonal spread, there is a certain amount of polarity in a NSL, meaning that you can influence the opponent's decision of which ball to play (or at least gain an easier break if they miss with the ball that they want to play) based on whether you place their backward or forward ball at H4 after 3-back.  This is more of an important decision in a game between stronger players who are capable of TP'ing, and also particularly in doubles this can be a critical tactical choice - for example if one of the opponents is a much weaker shot than the other, you would probably want to influence them to take the lift.
If the opponent chooses to lift their ball from H4 and take the "long" lift and misses from C3 to C4, then it is quite difficult for you to dig that ball out of C4 and into your break until you are for H4 yourself; on the other hand if the opponent lifts their ball from the west boundary and shoots from C3 to C4, it gives you the opportunity to establish a 4-ball break before you've even made H1 - you can do this by roqueting partner with your first shot, taking off to the C4 ball and playing a drive from C4, sending a pioneer to H2 while gaining a rush to H1 on the ball near H4.
Now consider that the opponent's clips are on penult and peg for example - it is highly likely in this scenario that the opponent will play their penult ball regardless of the ball positions.  Bearing this in mind, if you place the opponent's penult ball near the west boundary and their peg ball at H4, any missed lift with the penult ball will give you a greater chance at a 4-ball break and a possible TP.
A counter argument on the above scenario may be this: if the opponent (peg and penult) is bound to play their penult ball regardless of the ball positions, placing their penult ball on the west boundary may influence them to take the shorter lift shot from A Baulk instead of the longer shot from B Baulk, as they may correctly decide that missing any shot with their penult ball will give you a 4-ball break before H1.  Consider, instead, that placing the balls the "wrong" way round (peg ball on west boundary; penult ball at H4) and you may find your opponent will ultimately decide to take a longer shot with the penult ball than they may otherwise have done.  There is a balance of probabilities to be made between your expectation of the opponent hitting the long shot vs the short shot, and your reduced chances of making a game-winning break if they miss a more defensive shot into C4.

Advantages

Polarity - can influence opponent to play one ball or the other

Disadvantages

More tricky to make than a DSL
Easy to leave a double target from A Baulk if the ball at H4 is not perfectly placed

MSL (Maugham Standard Leave)
This is a variation on the NSL and was popularised by David Maugham, a leading player in the UK.  Compared to the NSL, instead of leaving a ball floating near the west boundary, after running 1-back under control you will croquet one of the opponent balls onto the middle of the west upright of H2.  In this position it cannot be rushed to H1 but acts as a perfect pioneer for H2.  As the ball at H2 is not rushable to H1, the rush is left for your partner ball to H1.



A MSL after a break by blue


This leave is more difficult to make than a NSL as it requires very good control of your break, particularly around 1-back, but there is a strong case to be made for it.  Assuming all the other clips are for H1, if the opponent lifts the ball from H4 and hits one of your balls down the east boundary from C3, then they will need to get a rush to H1 immediately.  Unless they just managed to snick the lift shot, then they are probably going to be faced with a long and difficult croquet stroke in order to obtain the rush to H1 on your other ball.
Placement of the ball at H2 after 1-back
The exact placement of the opponent ball onto the wire of H2 after running 1-back is shown in the animation below - tap on it to play.



Tap on the image to play the animation.


Blue makes 1-back off yellow with red as the escape ball for the southwards rush; partner (black) is the pioneer at 2-back.  When placing the ball on the wire of H2 after 1-back, you should endeavour to arrange the balls so that the placement is done from close range and can be done with a straight, gentle stop shot; playing this shot with any amount of split will mean that both the pace and the line will be much harder to judge.  Because you want to place the ball using a small straight stop shot, you should give some thought to the placement of the escape ball so that you will automatically gain a rush down the court on it without having to do anything with the striker's ball. 
Another advantage is that if the opponent lifts the ball from H4 and misses the long lift, you will be making H1 off partner (which is always comforting) and will have a perfect H2 pioneer.  This will pretty much guarantee that you are approaching H2 from a matter of inches away, and you can even look to get a dolly rush out of H2 towards C4 to develop the C4 ball before you have made H3.  Additionally, if you are looking at TPs, then having made H1 off partner, it will naturally be sent to H3 / 4b as a pioneer and potential peeling opportunity.
MSL summary
Advantages

Polarity - can influence opponent to play one ball or the other
You start next break by making H1 off partner
Probably the best leave for developing a standard triple opportunity
Potentially difficult break pickup for the opponent

Disadvantages

More tricky to make than a NSL or DSL
Rush to H1 from east boundary is slightly more difficult and is unlikely to be a dolly rush

Bryant Leave
This leave is named after NZ player Greg Bryant, who first started performing it regularly in 1993.  It is really the ultimate in aggressive leaves and is very difficult to make.  One ball is placed in the NSL position at H4, and the other is placed ideally about 1cm directly north of H1, or alternatively against the inside of one of the uprights, on the northern side.  Placement of this ball is difficult to get right and it is very important that none of the ball is showing through H1 on the southern side where it may be easy to hit from A Baulk.  



A Bryant Leave by blue


If you are preparing to make a Bryant Leave, then you must have an opponent ball as your 2-back pioneer.  Having a very close pioneer is important here, and you may consider placing it at 2-back from close range after H5 - ideally the pioneer will be 12 inches or less from 2-back. You should also have the other opponent ball at 1-back as the pioneer, which will naturally be sent out afterwards as the 3-back pioneer
Placement of the opponent ball at H1
This is the crucial part of the Bryant leave.  After making 1-back and loading the opponent ball to 3-back, you need a good rush on the pivot ball towards 2-back.  The pivot should then be placed around 1 yard east and 1 foot north of 2-back as an escape ball before you make 2-back off the opponent ball.



Tap on the image to play the animation.


After 2-back, roquet the opponent reception ball back in front of 2-back as close as possible and then place it into the required position with a delicate stop shot.  After that, you can roquet your escape ball (partner) towards 3-back and make the hoop off the other opponent ball, setting it in the NSL position afterwards.
Bryant Leave summary
Advantages

Opponent has no defensive shot so any miss will give you all the balls immediately
Artificial polarity - the opponent will still be more inclined to lift the ball from H1 despite having no safe shots
If the ball placed at H4 is for H2, it can be very tough to pick up a break after hitting the lift
Looks really cool

Disadvantages

There is no grey area - opponent has no defensive shot so may as well take the shortest shot
Difficult to make

Defensive Spread
A very good, and probably under-used, leave.  This leave is great if you are the stronger player playing against a weaker player.  While it only leaves a 13-yard lift shot, it gives very poor break prospects if the lift is hit.

The leave above is one variation of the defensive spread - a mirror image of the same leave can also be made, with blue/black laid up in C4 and one opponent ball near C2 and the other peg-high on the east boundary.
The variation where blue and black are laid up in C2 is an incredibly strong leave when red is for H3 (either by breaking down or by POPs during blue's break) and yellow is for 4-back - if red hits any lift shot whatsoever, its break  prospects are slim at best; on the other hand, a miss by red gives black strong prospects of starting a second break.  Even a more defensive miss of yellow at black gives fairly good break prospects for black.
This leave is perhaps at its best on a difficult lawn where picking up breaks is more challenging, and so you do not want to gift the opponent a break with balls in the middle of the court if they happen to hit your lift.  
Defensive Spread summary
Advantages

Very strong - if the clips are right
Gives very slim break prospects to your opponent if they hit the lift
Polarity - the opponent has aggressive and defensive lift shot options

Disadvantages

13-yard lift shot is conceded
Requires several accurate rushes to get exactly right

Vertical Spread
The vertical spread is generally thought of as a second-break leave, meaning that you would look to make this leave at the end of a break to the peg, normally when your partner has well advanced clips.  It is quite common to see players make this leave when their partner ball is for 4-back, however I would not advise doing so - it can be very difficult to finish from 4-back and peg after a miss by the opponent, and there are generally better leave options available for these clips.

The Vertical Spread is actually quite easy to make, because the opponent balls can be placed from close range after running penult and rover without having to play any difficult shots.  The exact placement of the two balls at penult and rover is also not as crucial as it is when placing a ball on the back of H1 for example, because penult and rover are further from baulk.  Still, you should aim to achieve ideal position of the two opponent balls as it will give greater flexibility when deciding where to lay your own balls up at the conclusion of the turn.  The ball at penult should be placed in the front of the jaws of H6 - it is also fine to be up against one wire or the other, so long as it is on the inside of the wire and not visible from baulk, and the ball should ideally not be showing through the hoop on the non-playing side of H6.  The position for the ball at rover is essentially the same, but mirrored.
The most obvious use case for this leave is when partner (black in this case) is for penult, as it will give you an easy finishing turn from any missed lift.  Please note the diagram above has the opponent balls laid up on the east boundary, but you can just as easily lay up on the west boundary, which may enable an easier rush to penult.
You can also think of this leave as a fairly defensive leave.  If the opponent already has an advanced clip, e.g. they are for 4-back and H1, then you should try and arrange their forward ball to be the ball left south of penult. Doing this will encourage them to lift their forward ball, however if they do decide to shoot and hit with their backward ball, their break pick-up will be very difficult indeed, because the ball left in penult cannot be rushed to either H1 or H2.
Vertical spread summary
Advantages

Relatively easy to make
Very strong break prospects for your partner ball (if the clips are right)
Very poor break prospects for the opponent ball (if the clips are right)

Disadvantages

Limited value if partner clip is not for penult (or H5)

Cross-Peg
You can think of the cross-peg leave a bit like a diagonal spread, but with the west boundary ball about 12 yards further in court than normal.  The way you go about making the cross-peg is the essentially the same as that of the DSL, but after making your final hoop of the turn, you need to get a good rush to the peg where the other two balls are waiting.



A cross-peg after a break to the peg by blue


Because the rush out of your final hoop is so crucial to getting a good cross-peg, you would not frequently see this leave after a break to 4-back - making 3-back with control and a dolly rush to the peg is relatively difficult for relatively little gain in having a cross-peg instead of a DSL.  It is much more common to set this leave after running rover when your partner is for 4-back or penult.  Running rover and obtaining a dolly rush to the peg is significantly easier than the same out of 3-back, and what's more, rover is significantly closer to the peg than 3-back is.  The benefit of a cross-peg over a DSL is also more evident when for 4-back, because at the start of your next turn you will avoid the slightly tricky cross-court rushes from the east boundary to the west boundary, and also from there to 4-back.  



Tap on the image to play the animation.


The crucial thing to remember when setting the cross-peg leave (aside from the actual wiring itself) is that you should make sure the two opponent balls are placed slightly off horizontal to each other; the westerly ball should be just north of the peg and the easterly ball just south of the peg.  If this is not achieved, then it is likely that the opponent will have a 13-yard shot from somewhere on the court.

Advantages

Easy to finish from 4-back and peg after a missed lift

Disadvantages

Wiring at close range at the peg can easily go wrong
No polarity
Easy break pick-up if lift is hit

Cross-Wire
A cross-wiring leave is where you leave both opponent balls close together at a hoop, wired from each other.  Cross-wiring can be done at any hoop, although it is not considered a lift leave - you should only plan to cross-wire if you have not made a lift hoop during your turn, otherwise the opponent will probably have a very short shot from one of the baulk lines.



Red and yellow are cross-wired at black's hoop


There is a sequence you should try to follow when making most cross-wires, which is:

Before making your final hoop, arrange one opponent ball and partner ball at the intended cross-wiring hoop
Make your final hoop off the opponent ball and gain a rush towards the cross-wiring hoop
Wire the two opponent balls at the hoop
Rush the escape ball (partner) away to a far corner

Cross-wiring opportunities
Cross-wiring is not a lift leave, so unless you are planning on laying for sextuples, most of the opportunities to do so tend to arise more by chance.  For example, if your clips are for penult and 3-back, and you hit in with your ball for penult, you can safely make your last two hoops without conceding a lift. In the example below, blue is for penult, black for 3-back; yellow has just broken down at H6 on a break.  Click the solution button below the image to see how blue might go about playing its next turn.

As you can see, the cross-wire is an incredibly strong leave and you should always be on the lookout for opportunities to make it - it will give a very long shot to your opponent, and an easy break if they miss, putting you in a very strong game position.
The (delayed) sextuple leave (or "1-back leave")
The main reasoning for playing for sextuples at all is to avoid the conceding of a lift, and so it is here where we can take advantage of cross-wiring as a standard part of a leave.  Below is a common leave seen when laying for a sextuple, leaving red and yellow the longest possible shot on the court:

To set this leave, you follow the same pattern outlined further above.  Before making hoop 6 (the final hoop of your turn), you should arrange one opponent and partner ball at hoop 1 (the cross-wiring hoop).  Make H6 with a rush back to H1 and cross-wire the opponent balls across the hoop, preferably diagonally, and gain a rush on partner ball towards C3.
The standard sextuple leave
Despite the name, this sextuple leave is rarely seen, both because it is much harder to get right, and also leaves a significantly shorter shot for the opponent.  The benefits of this leave as far as the sextuple goes is that it makes the sextuple turn a great deal easier, essentially nothing more than a quadruple peel. The standard sextuple leave is as follows:

Close





As you can see, when setting this leave, you actually complete the cross-wiring after H5, then rush partner to H6 to score that hoop, afterwards gaining a rush to 1-back.  The reason this method is favoured for this particular leave is so that you can be rushing to 1-back from close range (near H6) instead of from near 2-back as you would have to do when performing the cross-wire after H6. Rushing to 1-back from close range helps you to obtain a good position for the jawsing of your ball in 1-back.
Polarity in cross-wiring leaves
In reality, leaving both opponent balls together (albeit wired from each other) means that there is little-to-no polarity to be had; however, there are some things you can do to still encourage one ball to play over the other.  Imagine that blue has cross-wired red and yellow at H1  (black's hoop).  Red is for 4-back and yellow is for peg, and as such, the striker of blue and black would want to  encourage yellow to play by substantially lengthening red's shot - the following leave is able to achieve this:



A 1-back leave with a degree of polarity - red is the opponent's backward ball so its shot at blue/black has been lengthened


Red is placed very near the south boundary as a deliberately poor pioneer at H1, and the length of red's shot is increased by 5-6 yards over what it would be in a normal cross-wire.  Placing red as a deliberately poor pioneer at H1 may encourage yellow to play.  Be aware, of course, that placing balls deliberately close to the boundary should only be done if you are confident of picking up a break from those positions afterwards, particularly bearing in mind that yellow may choose to corner.
Cross-wiring summary
Advantages

Ultimate distance between the opponent's balls and yours - normally 30+ yards
Gives you an easy break with a ball at your hoop if they miss

Disadvantages

No grey area - opponent is generally compelled to shoot
Not much polarity to be had
Opponent generally has an easy break if they hit (depending on clips)

Back to top

Third Turn Leaves
Generally when referring to a third-turn leave we are referring to when a player has hit on the third turn of the game and played a break to 4-back with 3 balls, then set a leave.  Bearing in mind that the fourth ball is not yet played into the game, the opponent does not have the option of which ball to play with their fourth-turn shot - they must play the remaining ball.  As such, there are opportunities to set a leave utilising the opponent's ball in close proximity to your own.
Three Ducks Leave
This leave is probably the most popular of all the third-turn leaves after a break to 4-back.



The standard Three Ducks leave after a break to 4-back by blue


The Three Ducks is so named because the balls are arranged like "ducks in a row", near the west boundary.  The best way to arrange this leave is to have your H1 ball near/on the west boundary, with the opponent ball about 1 yard further in-court and your 4-back ball another yard further in again - assuming an opponent miss, this then enables you to set an opponent ball as the H2 pioneer and take partner ball to H1 - which in turn will be sent to H3 / 4b for potential peeling opportunities later.
The Three Ducks is the most aggressive of the third-turn leaves and doesn't really leave any defensive option for the opponent.  Having said that, if the opponent takes the longer lift shot from C1 through to C2, it can be a bit tricky to dig the C2 ball out if you do not get a forward rush out of H1.  If no forward rush is achieved, you may choose to take off to C2 instead of croquet partner ball to H3.
Reverse Three Ducks Leave
A perfectly valid option, but far less frequently used.  This is a mirror image of the regular Three Ducks, although it is probably a bit more difficult to pick up a break from a missed lift.  It is easier to make than the regular Three Ducks as it doesn't require control out of 3b.



A reverse Three Ducks leave


If the opponent misses the shot from C3 to C4 there is an interesting opportunity to play a bombard on the in-lawn ball to H1 while approaching the ball in C4 - certainly it is not the kind of shot you would want to approach without having practised it, but if played successfully, gives an immediate 4-ball break.  
Third-Turn NSL
This leave is just like a regular NSL but obviously with a ball missing.  Again it's best to have your 4-back ball in the NSL position at H4, so the way you go about making this leave is slightly different than a normal NSL.



A third turn NSL by blue


After making 3-back you can rush partner out to the east boundary, then rush the opponent's ball back slightly south of 3-back.  A little stop shot is then played to send the opponent ball out towards partner while approaching the intended wired spot at H4 with striker's ball.
Another method would be to rush both partner and opponent out towards their east boundary positions, and then takeoff back to place your ball in the wired spot at H4. 
The fourth turn shot from the opponent is the exact equivalent of them lifting the ball from the west boundary and taking their lift shot.
Third-Turn Defensive Spread
The third-turn leave favoured by stronger players - this looks a lot like a DSL but with the peg ball missing.



A third-turn Defensive Spread by blue


After a fourth-turn miss from the opponent, the break pickup is similar to that of a DSL, but ideally the initial rush is left for the H1 ball on the opponent's ball, and your 4-back ball is placed on or near the west boundary. This gives the advantage of taking the rush to H1 with partner. 
When making this leave, very strong players will likely play their 4-back ball all the way to the west boundary with their final shot for blue, instead of lagging the ball a yard or two from the yardline - this adds more defence to the leave, and means that if the opponent does hit the long lift their break pick-up will be even more difficult.

Super Advanced Leaves

The Super Advanced game is a slightly modified version of association croquet that is played at championship level in England.  It incorporates an additional lift (at hoop 4) when compared to normal advanced rules, and hence changes the tactics and first-break leaves quite considerably.  As a result, all the golden rules for leave-making go out the window.  A separate article about super advanced first-break tactics and leaves is available here

Leaves
A "leave" in croquet is the culmination of the process of arranging the balls at the end of your turn.  The idea is that you keep the "innings", which normally means laying the court in an adventageous way for your partner ball, and that the opponent balls will be far apart, or at least wired from each other, with no short shots available.
What makes a good leave?

Your two balls close together with a useful rush
No shot shorter than 13 yards for the opponent, and no double target

What makes a great leave?

Your next turn is easier if the opponent misses than their turn is if they hit
No shot shorter than 17 yards for the opponent
Leaving some grey area - options available for the opponent to take a longer, more defensive shot
Polarity - influencing the opponent to play one ball over another, due to where it is positioned

Golden rules for making leaves
When all four balls are on the lawn, there are really two golden rules to leave-making that you should try to adhere to at all times.  Firstly, you should ensure that the very final ball you roquet in your turn should be your partner ball - this helps to organise a good rush for starting your next turn.  Secondly, you should try and ensure to always make your final hoop of the turn off an opponent's ball.  These two points are somewhat interrelated in that if you make your final hoop off the opponent, you will be roqueting it first after making the hoop, leaving partner ball "live" to be roqueted in a few strokes' time.

Diagonal Spread
The diagonal spread leave, or DSL for short, is probably the most commonly-attempted leave in croquet.  The reasons for this are that it is relatively easy to make, it is relatively forgiving if it goes horribly wrong, and doesn't leave any short shots from any baulk line.  It is a fairly hoop-agnostic leave, meaning that it is generally pretty easy to pick up a break from a DSL after a miss by the opponent, regardless of the hoop you are for.  In the example below, a DSL has been made after a break to 4-back by blue, with partner ball (black) for hoop 1.

As discussed in the golden rules above, the opponent ball is sent to 3-back (the final hoop of the turn).  Interestingly a good way to help achieve this is to organise earlier in the break to send partner to 2-back as an early pioneer after hoop 5 - if you send partner to 2-back then the 3-back pioneer will naturally be one of the opponent balls.
Before making 3-back you should organise the other opponent ball near the peg, fairly close to where you want its final position to be, and organise your partner ball 1-2 yards east of it to act as the escape ball. After making 3-back and croqueting the reception ball out towards the west boundary, you should try and rush the opponent ball by the peg into a wired spot immediately - the closer you can get it to the wired spot using a rush, the easier your job will be to wire it with the croquet stroke. Once the ball at the peg has been placed in the wired spot, you rush your escape ball (partner) out to the east boundary and lay a rush into the court for your partner ball, with both balls being wired from the ball at the peg, and ideally also wired from the ball near the west boundary.
Reverse DSL
A reverse diagonal spread is made in exactly the same way, but just organising the balls in a mirror-image, as in the diagram below.  Actually this can be quite a useful leave after a break to the peg when your partner ball is on 2-back, 3-back or 4-back as it makes picking up a break from any of these hoops fairly straightforward - certainly easier than a normal DSL.



A reverse DSL


The "B" Spread
If the diagonal spread is the most commonly-attempted leave, the "B" spread is probably the most commonly-completed leave.  Basically a "B" spread is a diagonal spread that has gone wrong when it comes to the wiring of the opponent balls at the peg.  Because the peg is narrow, the margins for error are fairly small.
Taking a step back, it is important to identify one of the most crucial parts of setting a DSL, and where a DSL is liable to go wrong - running 3-back.  Because of the distance between 3-back and the peg, it is quite important to get a forward rush out of 3-back to ensure that you are playing the crucial croquet stroke to place one oppo ball near the west boundary while approaching the other, from fairly close range.  It is very easy to lose control of the striker's ball when sending it more than a few yards in a croquet stroke and so any inaccuracies with the croquet stroke after 3-back stroke will compound in the placement of the ball near the peg. All too often, players will fail to get a rush out of 3-back, play a croquet stroke that leaves them a 2-yard roquet on the ball near the peg, and then roquet it so far out of position that they are unable to reliably croquet it back to the wired spot at the peg - this is by far the most common cause of the "B" spread.  If the ball near the peg is left open on the other opponent ball near the west boundary it generally results in leaving a 10-yard shot for the opponent.

If you have gotten into a position whereby the opponent balls are left open across the peg, then it is worth considering not laying a rush for your partner, but instead wide-joining near corner 4, or in some cases even splitting up your balls completely, with one on the east boundary and the other in or near corner 2.
Do keep in mind that, although the "B" spread is a bad leave, a 10-yard shot still requires hitting, and it is a shot that is missed surprisingly frequently, even by strong players.  This is the advantage of attempting a diagonal spread - if it does go badly wrong and balls are left open, the opponent will still not have any shorter shot than around 10 yards. 
Backing out of a DSL
If your DSL is headed towards being a "B" spread then you have options to back out of it.  After making 3-back and sending an opponent ball towards the west boundary, it is at this point that you need to make a decision to continue with the DSL and risk a "B" spread or to back out and set an OSL - which we will look at further down this article.

Disadvantages

Not polarising - doesn't force a particular opponent ball to play

Old Standard Leave
The Old Standard Leave, or OSL, was popular in earlier times, particularly in the 1960s.  Traditionally, the standard first-break tactic was to play your break to 4-back, peeling your partner through hoop 1 after 2-back, then after making 3-back to set an OSL (or "standard leave", as they were referred to at that time).  These days, the tactic of peeling partner through hoop 1 after 2-back is almost entirely extinct, as it is generally considered unhelpful - but the OSL is still a strong leave in its own right, whether partner is for H1 or H2.  The leave is very simple to make and leaves a 13-yard shot for the opponent ball at your balls in C4 from A Baulk.  There is no defensive option shot for the opponent to consider and they will have a fairly simple break pickup if they hit.

New Standard Leave
A new leave became popular in the 1990s in favour of the OSL, and is somewhat originally named the "New Standard Leave".  This leave is still one of the most popular leaves done today at the end of a break to 4-back.

There are 2 popular methods of making this leave:

With partner at 2-back - make 1-back off an opponent ball and place it near the west boundary after the hoop, then rush the other opponent ball down the court, loading it to 3-back as a pioneer; make 2-back off partner ball and get a rush to 3-back where the other opponent ball is waiting
With opponent at 2-back - make 2-back and croquet the opponent towards the west boundary while gaining a rush on partner towards 3-back where the other opponent ball is waiting

The first method has the advantage of giving good control over the placement of the west boundary ball whereas the second method has the advantage of not requiring an easterly rush out of 2-back.  Whichever method you choose, it is imperative that the 3-back pioneer is the opponent ball, because after making 3-back, the reception ball will need to be left in a very specific spot a few inches north-east of the hoop.
Placement of ball at H4
The trickiest part of setting the NSL is getting the ball at H4 accurately placed - you need to place it close enough to H4 that the ball will not have a backswing to shoot at your two balls on the east boundary.  You must also ensure that none of the ball is visible from A Baulk - even if an edge is visible it is sometimes possible for the opponent to shoot from A Baulk at a pseudo-double target with the edge of the ball at H4 and one of your balls in the background on the east boundary.  Finally, the ball must not be positioned in such a way that it does not rush to H1
In order to place the ball in the best spot, it is quite important that the approach is played from close-by and slightly south-east of the hoop. The hoop approach should ideally place the opponent ball just north of the ideal wired spot so that the hoop can be run past the reception ball and then roquet it back onto the perfect wired line - see the animation below:



Tap on the image to play the animation.


In the animation above, the grey circle indicates the ideal wired spot for red and the diagonal lines show the area which is wired from A Baulk.  It is perfectly reasonable to try and place the opponent ball in the ideal spot with the hoop approach - doing so will mean that you don't need to roquet it at all after the hoop and can instead just roquet black, leaving red where it is; but beware that trying to place red ideally in the hoop approach and leaving it short will make correcting the wiring more difficult - any roquet on a short red will only be sending it further away from the ideal spot.
Polarity
Unlike the diagonal spread, there is a certain amount of polarity in a NSL, meaning that you can influence the opponent's decision of which ball to play (or at least gain an easier break if they miss with the ball that they want to play) based on whether you place their backward or forward ball at H4 after 3-back.  This is more of an important decision in a game between stronger players who are capable of TP'ing, and also particularly in doubles this can be a critical tactical choice - for example if one of the opponents is a much weaker shot than the other, you would probably want to influence them to take the lift.
If the opponent chooses to lift their ball from H4 and take the "long" lift and misses from C3 to C4, then it is quite difficult for you to dig that ball out of C4 and into your break until you are for H4 yourself; on the other hand if the opponent lifts their ball from the west boundary and shoots from C3 to C4, it gives you the opportunity to establish a 4-ball break before you've even made H1 - you can do this by roqueting partner with your first shot, taking off to the C4 ball and playing a drive from C4, sending a pioneer to H2 while gaining a rush to H1 on the ball near H4.
Now consider that the opponent's clips are on penult and peg for example - it is highly likely in this scenario that the opponent will play their penult ball regardless of the ball positions.  Bearing this in mind, if you place the opponent's penult ball near the west boundary and their peg ball at H4, any missed lift with the penult ball will give you a greater chance at a 4-ball break and a possible TP.
A counter argument on the above scenario may be this: if the opponent (peg and penult) is bound to play their penult ball regardless of the ball positions, placing their penult ball on the west boundary may influence them to take the shorter lift shot from A Baulk instead of the longer shot from B Baulk, as they may correctly decide that missing any shot with their penult ball will give you a 4-ball break before H1.  Consider, instead, that placing the balls the "wrong" way round (peg ball on west boundary; penult ball at H4) and you may find your opponent will ultimately decide to take a longer shot with the penult ball than they may otherwise have done.  There is a balance of probabilities to be made between your expectation of the opponent hitting the long shot vs the short shot, and your reduced chances of making a game-winning break if they miss a more defensive shot into C4.
NSL summary
Advantages

Polarity - can influence opponent to play one ball or the other

Disadvantages

More tricky to make than a DSL
Easy to leave a double target from A Baulk if the ball at H4 is not perfectly placed

MSL (Maugham Standard Leave)
This is a variation on the NSL and was popularised by David Maugham, a leading player in the UK.  Compared to the NSL, instead of leaving a ball floating near the west boundary, after running 1-back under control you will croquet one of the opponent balls onto the middle of the west upright of H2.  In this position it cannot be rushed to H1 but acts as a perfect pioneer for H2.  As the ball at H2 is not rushable to H1, the rush is left for your partner ball to H1.



A MSL after a break by blue


This leave is more difficult to make than a NSL as it requires very good control of your break, particularly around 1-back, but there is a strong case to be made for it.  Assuming all the other clips are for H1, if the opponent lifts the ball from H4 and hits one of your balls down the east boundary from C3, then they will need to get a rush to H1 immediately.  Unless they just managed to snick the lift shot, then they are probably going to be faced with a long and difficult croquet stroke in order to obtain the rush to H1 on your other ball.
Placement of the ball at H2 after 1-back
The exact placement of the opponent ball onto the wire of H2 after running 1-back is shown in the animation below - tap on it to play.



Tap on the image to play the animation.


Blue makes 1-back off yellow with red as the escape ball for the southwards rush; partner (black) is the pioneer at 2-back.  When placing the ball on the wire of H2 after 1-back, you should endeavour to arrange the balls so that the placement is done from close range and can be done with a straight, gentle stop shot; playing this shot with any amount of split will mean that both the pace and the line will be much harder to judge.  Because you want to place the ball using a small straight stop shot, you should give some thought to the placement of the escape ball so that you will automatically gain a rush down the court on it without having to do anything with the striker's ball. 
Another advantage is that if the opponent lifts the ball from H4 and misses the long lift, you will be making H1 off partner (which is always comforting) and will have a perfect H2 pioneer.  This will pretty much guarantee that you are approaching H2 from a matter of inches away, and you can even look to get a dolly rush out of H2 towards C4 to develop the C4 ball before you have made H3.  Additionally, if you are looking at TPs, then having made H1 off partner, it will naturally be sent to H3 / 4b as a pioneer and potential peeling opportunity.
MSL summary
Advantages

Polarity - can influence opponent to play one ball or the other
You start next break by making H1 off partner
Probably the best leave for developing a standard triple opportunity
Potentially difficult break pickup for the opponent

Disadvantages

More tricky to make than a NSL or DSL
Rush to H1 from east boundary is slightly more difficult and is unlikely to be a dolly rush

Bryant Leave
This leave is named after NZ player Greg Bryant, who first started performing it regularly in 1993.  It is really the ultimate in aggressive leaves and is very difficult to make.  One ball is placed in the NSL position at H4, and the other is placed ideally about 1cm directly north of H1, or alternatively against the inside of one of the uprights, on the northern side.  Placement of this ball is difficult to get right and it is very important that none of the ball is showing through H1 on the southern side where it may be easy to hit from A Baulk.  



A Bryant Leave by blue


If you are preparing to make a Bryant Leave, then you must have an opponent ball as your 2-back pioneer.  Having a very close pioneer is important here, and you may consider placing it at 2-back from close range after H5 - ideally the pioneer will be 12 inches or less from 2-back. You should also have the other opponent ball at 1-back as the pioneer, which will naturally be sent out afterwards as the 3-back pioneer
Placement of the opponent ball at H1
This is the crucial part of the Bryant leave.  After making 1-back and loading the opponent ball to 3-back, you need a good rush on the pivot ball towards 2-back.  The pivot should then be placed around 1 yard east and 1 foot north of 2-back as an escape ball before you make 2-back off the opponent ball.



Tap on the image to play the animation.


After 2-back, roquet the opponent reception ball back in front of 2-back as close as possible and then place it into the required position with a delicate stop shot.  After that, you can roquet your escape ball (partner) towards 3-back and make the hoop off the other opponent ball, setting it in the NSL position afterwards.
Bryant Leave summary
Advantages

Opponent has no defensive shot so any miss will give you all the balls immediately
Artificial polarity - the opponent will still be more inclined to lift the ball from H1 despite having no safe shots
If the ball placed at H4 is for H2, it can be very tough to pick up a break after hitting the lift
Looks really cool

Disadvantages

There is no grey area - opponent has no defensive shot so may as well take the shortest shot
Difficult to make

Defensive Spread
A very good, and probably under-used, leave.  This leave is great if you are the stronger player playing against a weaker player.  While it only leaves a 13-yard lift shot, it gives very poor break prospects if the lift is hit.

The leave above is one variation of the defensive spread - a mirror image of the same leave can also be made, with blue/black laid up in C4 and one opponent ball near C2 and the other peg-high on the east boundary.
The variation where blue and black are laid up in C2 is an incredibly strong leave when red is for H3 (either by breaking down or by POPs during blue's break) and yellow is for 4-back - if red hits any lift shot whatsoever, its break  prospects are slim at best; on the other hand, a miss by red gives black strong prospects of starting a second break.  Even a more defensive miss of yellow at black gives fairly good break prospects for black.
This leave is perhaps at its best on a difficult lawn where picking up breaks is more challenging, and so you do not want to gift the opponent a break with balls in the middle of the court if they happen to hit your lift.  
Defensive Spread summary
Advantages

Very strong - if the clips are right
Gives very slim break prospects to your opponent if they hit the lift
Polarity - the opponent has aggressive and defensive lift shot options

Disadvantages

13-yard lift shot is conceded
Requires several accurate rushes to get exactly right

Vertical Spread
The vertical spread is generally thought of as a second-break leave, meaning that you would look to make this leave at the end of a break to the peg, normally when your partner has well advanced clips.  It is quite common to see players make this leave when their partner ball is for 4-back, however I would not advise doing so - it can be very difficult to finish from 4-back and peg after a miss by the opponent, and there are generally better leave options available for these clips.

The Vertical Spread is actually quite easy to make, because the opponent balls can be placed from close range after running penult and rover without having to play any difficult shots.  The exact placement of the two balls at penult and rover is also not as crucial as it is when placing a ball on the back of H1 for example, because penult and rover are further from baulk.  Still, you should aim to achieve ideal position of the two opponent balls as it will give greater flexibility when deciding where to lay your own balls up at the conclusion of the turn.  The ball at penult should be placed in the front of the jaws of H6 - it is also fine to be up against one wire or the other, so long as it is on the inside of the wire and not visible from baulk, and the ball should ideally not be showing through the hoop on the non-playing side of H6.  The position for the ball at rover is essentially the same, but mirrored.
The most obvious use case for this leave is when partner (black in this case) is for penult, as it will give you an easy finishing turn from any missed lift.  Please note the diagram above has the opponent balls laid up on the east boundary, but you can just as easily lay up on the west boundary, which may enable an easier rush to penult.
You can also think of this leave as a fairly defensive leave.  If the opponent already has an advanced clip, e.g. they are for 4-back and H1, then you should try and arrange their forward ball to be the ball left south of penult. Doing this will encourage them to lift their forward ball, however if they do decide to shoot and hit with their backward ball, their break pick-up will be very difficult indeed, because the ball left in penult cannot be rushed to either H1 or H2.
Vertical spread summary
Advantages

Relatively easy to make
Very strong break prospects for your partner ball (if the clips are right)
Very poor break prospects for the opponent ball (if the clips are right)

Disadvantages

Limited value if partner clip is not for penult (or H5)

Cross-Peg
You can think of the cross-peg leave a bit like a diagonal spread, but with the west boundary ball about 12 yards further in court than normal.  The way you go about making the cross-peg is the essentially the same as that of the DSL, but after making your final hoop of the turn, you need to get a good rush to the peg where the other two balls are waiting.



A cross-peg after a break to the peg by blue


Because the rush out of your final hoop is so crucial to getting a good cross-peg, you would not frequently see this leave after a break to 4-back - making 3-back with control and a dolly rush to the peg is relatively difficult for relatively little gain in having a cross-peg instead of a DSL.  It is much more common to set this leave after running rover when your partner is for 4-back or penult.  Running rover and obtaining a dolly rush to the peg is significantly easier than the same out of 3-back, and what's more, rover is significantly closer to the peg than 3-back is.  The benefit of a cross-peg over a DSL is also more evident when for 4-back, because at the start of your next turn you will avoid the slightly tricky cross-court rushes from the east boundary to the west boundary, and also from there to 4-back.  



Tap on the image to play the animation.


The crucial thing to remember when setting the cross-peg leave (aside from the actual wiring itself) is that you should make sure the two opponent balls are placed slightly off horizontal to each other; the westerly ball should be just north of the peg and the easterly ball just south of the peg.  If this is not achieved, then it is likely that the opponent will have a 13-yard shot from somewhere on the court.
Cross-peg summary
Advantages

Easy to finish from 4-back and peg after a missed lift

Disadvantages

Wiring at close range at the peg can easily go wrong
No polarity
Easy break pick-up if lift is hit

Back to top

Cross-Wire
A cross-wiring leave is where you leave both opponent balls close together at a hoop, wired from each other.  Cross-wiring can be done at any hoop, although it is not considered a lift leave - you should only plan to cross-wire if you have not made a lift hoop during your turn, otherwise the opponent will probably have a very short shot from one of the baulk lines.



Red and yellow are cross-wired at black's hoop


There is a sequence you should try to follow when making most cross-wires, which is:

Before making your final hoop, arrange one opponent ball and partner ball at the intended cross-wiring hoop
Make your final hoop off the opponent ball and gain a rush towards the cross-wiring hoop
Wire the two opponent balls at the hoop
Rush the escape ball (partner) away to a far corner

Cross-wiring opportunities
Cross-wiring is not a lift leave, so unless you are planning on laying for sextuples, most of the opportunities to do so tend to arise more by chance.  For example, if your clips are for penult and 3-back, and you hit in with your ball for penult, you can safely make your last two hoops without conceding a lift. In the example below, blue is for penult, black for 3-back; yellow has just broken down at H6 on a break.  Click the solution button below the image to see how blue might go about playing its next turn.

As you can see, the cross-wire is an incredibly strong leave and you should always be on the lookout for opportunities to make it - it will give a very long shot to your opponent, and an easy break if they miss, putting you in a very strong game position.
The (delayed) sextuple leave (or "1-back leave")
The main reasoning for playing for sextuples at all is to avoid the conceding of a lift, and so it is here where we can take advantage of cross-wiring as a standard part of a leave.  Below is a common leave seen when laying for a sextuple, leaving red and yellow the longest possible shot on the court:

To set this leave, you follow the same pattern outlined further above.  Before making hoop 6 (the final hoop of your turn), you should arrange one opponent and partner ball at hoop 1 (the cross-wiring hoop).  Make H6 with a rush back to H1 and cross-wire the opponent balls across the hoop, preferably diagonally, and gain a rush on partner ball towards C3.
The standard sextuple leave
Despite the name, this sextuple leave is rarely seen, both because it is much harder to get right, and also leaves a significantly shorter shot for the opponent.  The benefits of this leave as far as the sextuple goes is that it makes the sextuple turn a great deal easier, essentially nothing more than a quadruple peel. The standard sextuple leave is as follows:

                Click on the court to play the animation.  The action starts with blue running H4.



Close





As you can see, when setting this leave, you actually complete the cross-wiring after H5, then rush partner to H6 to score that hoop, afterwards gaining a rush to 1-back.  The reason this method is favoured for this particular leave is so that you can be rushing to 1-back from close range (near H6) instead of from near 2-back as you would have to do when performing the cross-wire after H6. Rushing to 1-back from close range helps you to obtain a good position for the jawsing of your ball in 1-back.
Polarity in cross-wiring leaves
In reality, leaving both opponent balls together (albeit wired from each other) means that there is little-to-no polarity to be had; however, there are some things you can do to still encourage one ball to play over the other.  Imagine that blue has cross-wired red and yellow at H1  (black's hoop).  Red is for 4-back and yellow is for peg, and as such, the striker of blue and black would want to  encourage yellow to play by substantially lengthening red's shot - the following leave is able to achieve this:



A 1-back leave with a degree of polarity - red is the opponent's backward ball so its shot at blue/black has been lengthened


Red is placed very near the south boundary as a deliberately poor pioneer at H1, and the length of red's shot is increased by 5-6 yards over what it would be in a normal cross-wire.  Placing red as a deliberately poor pioneer at H1 may encourage yellow to play.  Be aware, of course, that placing balls deliberately close to the boundary should only be done if you are confident of picking up a break from those positions afterwards, particularly bearing in mind that yellow may choose to corner.
Cross-wiring summary
Advantages

Ultimate distance between the opponent's balls and yours - normally 30+ yards
Gives you an easy break with a ball at your hoop if they miss

Disadvantages

No grey area - opponent is generally compelled to shoot
Not much polarity to be had
Opponent generally has an easy break if they hit (depending on clips)

Back to top

Third Turn Leaves
Generally when referring to a third-turn leave we are referring to when a player has hit on the third turn of the game and played a break to 4-back with 3 balls, then set a leave.  Bearing in mind that the fourth ball is not yet played into the game, the opponent does not have the option of which ball to play with their fourth-turn shot - they must play the remaining ball.  As such, there are opportunities to set a leave utilising the opponent's ball in close proximity to your own.
Three Ducks Leave
This leave is probably the most popular of all the third-turn leaves after a break to 4-back.



The standard Three Ducks leave after a break to 4-back by blue


The Three Ducks is so named because the balls are arranged like "ducks in a row", near the west boundary.  The best way to arrange this leave is to have your H1 ball near/on the west boundary, with the opponent ball about 1 yard further in-court and your 4-back ball another yard further in again - assuming an opponent miss, this then enables you to set an opponent ball as the H2 pioneer and take partner ball to H1 - which in turn will be sent to H3 / 4b for potential peeling opportunities later.
The Three Ducks is the most aggressive of the third-turn leaves and doesn't really leave any defensive option for the opponent.  Having said that, if the opponent takes the longer lift shot from C1 through to C2, it can be a bit tricky to dig the C2 ball out if you do not get a forward rush out of H1.  If no forward rush is achieved, you may choose to take off to C2 instead of croquet partner ball to H3.
Reverse Three Ducks Leave
A perfectly valid option, but far less frequently used.  This is a mirror image of the regular Three Ducks, although it is probably a bit more difficult to pick up a break from a missed lift.  It is easier to make than the regular Three Ducks as it doesn't require control out of 3b.



A reverse Three Ducks leave


If the opponent misses the shot from C3 to C4 there is an interesting opportunity to play a bombard on the in-lawn ball to H1 while approaching the ball in C4 - certainly it is not the kind of shot you would want to approach without having practised it, but if played successfully, gives an immediate 4-ball break.  
Third-Turn NSL
This leave is just like a regular NSL but obviously with a ball missing.  Again it's best to have your 4-back ball in the NSL position at H4, so the way you go about making this leave is slightly different than a normal NSL.



A third turn NSL by blue


After making 3-back you can rush partner out to the east boundary, then rush the opponent's ball back slightly south of 3-back.  A little stop shot is then played to send the opponent ball out towards partner while approaching the intended wired spot at H4 with striker's ball.
Another method would be to rush both partner and opponent out towards their east boundary positions, and then takeoff back to place your ball in the wired spot at H4. 
The fourth turn shot from the opponent is the exact equivalent of them lifting the ball from the west boundary and taking their lift shot.
Third-Turn Defensive Spread
The third-turn leave favoured by stronger players - this looks a lot like a DSL but with the peg ball missing.



A third-turn Defensive Spread by blue


After a fourth-turn miss from the opponent, the break pickup is similar to that of a DSL, but ideally the initial rush is left for the H1 ball on the opponent's ball, and your 4-back ball is placed on or near the west boundary. This gives the advantage of taking the rush to H1 with partner. 
When making this leave, very strong players will likely play their 4-back ball all the way to the west boundary with their final shot for blue, instead of lagging the ball a yard or two from the yardline - this adds more defence to the leave, and means that if the opponent does hit the long lift their break pick-up will be even more difficult.

Super Advanced Leaves

The Super Advanced game is a slightly modified version of association croquet that is played at championship level in England.  It incorporates an additional lift (at hoop 4) when compared to normal advanced rules, and hence changes the tactics and first-break leaves quite considerably.  As a result, all the golden rules for leave-making go out the window.  A separate article about super advanced first-break tactics and leaves is available here

Super Advanced

In the Super Advanced game, which has been in use for Championship-level events in England since around 2010, there is an additional lift conceded after running hoop 4, along with the usual lift hoops of 1-back and 4-back.  If all 3 lift hoops are made in a single turn before the striker's partner ball has passed hoop 4, then a lift-to-position is conceded, meaning that the opponent can start their turn by placing their ball anywhere on the court - even within yardlines.  As a result, it has opened up different options to the player of the first break, and consequently a number of different leave choices and game tactics.  
        



Leaves in super advanced often look very different when compared to regular advanced croquet


First break and game strategy
Fundamentally the following options are available:
- Take first break to 4-back
This put the most points on the board possible without conceding lift-to-position and maximises pressure on the opponent, as any mistake they make will give you a chance to win the game with a TP
- Take first break to 3-back
This is an interesting option as it takes the TPO out of the equation for the opponent.  At the highest level you will still see players attempting and regularly completing QPOs but this is substantially more difficult than a TPO.  Even if you yourself are not all that confident at completing or even attempting a QP, it still puts you in a strong position.  Having first clip on 3-back gives better options if you manage to regain the innings with the forward ball - you are able to make 3-back and have all the extra strokes available from doing so to organise a stronger leave for your H1 ball
- Take first break to 1-back with leave for 1-back ball
This is arguably the most defensive option but also a very effective option that is under-used.  It retains the innings and concedes a lift shot which, if missed, will see your 1-back ball continue its break towards 4-back
- Take first break to H6 or H5 with leave for H6 or H5 ball
A variation on the first break to 1-back.  This is a good option if you have control of all the balls in your break by the time you have made H3.  This method still gets the H4 lift hoop out of the way but means that part two of your break to 4-back is starting from an earlier position, and hence more strokes are available to organise a strong leave.  Note that continuing your break from H6 will mean that partner ball will naturally become the 3-back pioneer, so starting from H5 is slightly preferable.
- Take first break to 1-back with leave for H1 ball
Generally an option taken only by the very top players who are confident enough to try a SXP - it is the most effective way of winning - if you can do it.  
Contact leaves
The most popular tactic in super advanced play is to take the first ball to 4-back.  Assuming all the other clips are for H1, then a fundamentally good contact leave will have both the opponent balls close together, normally across a corner with no useful rush, and the striker's balls separated into distant corners, with no balls near H1.  With this in mind, the standard contact leave is as follows:



A very standard super advanced leave.  Opponent balls close together in or near C4, your H1 ball in C2 and your striker's ball (for 4-back) in C3



The easiest way to make this leave is to arrange partner ball as the 1-back pioneer on the first break, then after 1-back rush partner near to C2.  Then continue the break as normal, sending out the opponent ball to 3-back as a pioneer and make 2-back under control.  Before 3-back send the 2-back reception ball close to C4 and after 3-back rush the 3-back reception ball towards C4 - at this point if you have good control, you may even try to arrange both opponent balls in C4, as touching balls, as this maximises the difficulty of the opponent's contact turn.  
A similar leave can be employed when stopping the first break at 3-back.  In this case, instead of having a 3-back pioneer, the ball should be placed closer towards C4, and great care should be taken to get an eastwards rush out of 2-back.  It is best to take this rush and try to rush the opponent ball into or near to C4 immediately after 2-back and then takeoff back to get a rush on the in-lawn ball towards the corner, or slightly west or north of it. 
It is worth noting that a very effective contact leave is actually quite easy to make.  As long as balls are on boundaries far from the opponent's hoops, and the opponent balls are together with no useful rush, then it is very difficult for the opponent to score any points from the contact turn.  However it is still worth putting as much effort into the leave as possible.  For example, if the opponent balls are both in contact in C4, it will make any potential croquet stroke taken from either of your balls going to their partner all the more difficult than if their partner is 5 yards up the boundary.  This could be the difference between them making a good leave leaving no shot and a bad leave leaving a double target.  
Lift leaves
When making a lift leave with the first ball, it is still most common to stop the break at 1-back, meaning the leave will be made after scoring H6.  The easiest leave to make from this position is the diagonal spread:



Blue has made a break to 1-back.  Note the rush is left for blue


After H6, the reception ball is rushed south-east and then croqueted out towards the west boundary, while approaching the other opponent ball near the peg.  Beware not to leave the ball at the peg too close and block the path to rush it towards 1-back in your next turn.
When stopping at H6 or H5 the most common leave is still a diagonal spread because it is the easiest leave to make and also tends to be the most forgiving if not executed perfectly - generally even if the wiring is poor then the opponent will have a 10+ yard shot.  Stopping at H5, there is also the opportunity to lay a NSL-type leave, where you place the ball NE of H4 after running H4.  
There are of course downsides to setting a diagonal spread or NSL-style leave - one of the key weaknesses is that it is quite easy to establish a break from a DSL - whether it's you or your opponent doing it.  Consider a position where the opponent's clips are H1 and 4-back - you have gained the innings but are not TPO'ing - instead you wish to retain the innings and only concede a lift with the first ball - you could consider doing something as follows:



Opponent's 4-back ball is placed on the wire of H4 after running H4.  It is rushable to H5 but not H1




The above leave is a good one as it means that the opponent will still have difficulty picking up a break with their backward ball if they hit the lift - the ball against H4 cannot be rushed to H1



This time blue has stopped at H6 - the opponent's forward ball is placed on the wire of H6 after making H5, un-rushable to H1 or H2


It is always good to look for opportunities to maximise the difficulty of the opponent's break pick-up on the off-chance that they do hit the lift - it could mean the difference between having another turn or not.
You may also even consider the following, if the opponent's backward ball is on H2 (or if you manage to get an early POP on their H1 ball at some point before you make H4)



Diagonal spread with the ball at the peg (opponent's forward ball) tight against the peg, unrushable to H2, laying up for H6 ball.  


Sextuple leaves
The most obvious sextuple leave in super advanced is the standard diagonal spread - it is easy to make and is a familiar leave to establish a break from.  For sextuples it has the downside of allowing the opponent a shot from C3 through your balls on the east boundary and into the relative safety of C4.  When attempting a sextuple it is very important to be able to access this C4 ball as soon as possible after making hoop 1, but it is not easy to dig it out due to the distances involved.  You may choose to make H1 and then try and rush to (or near to) C4 and leave a big roll from C4 towards partner at H2, or may choose to ignore the C4 ball completely until after H2 - there is an opportunity peel partner through 1-back after H2 while approaching the C4 ball as your "escape ball" however there are very few players who would be comfortable with such a shot.



Super advanced SXP leave (blue for 1-back; black for H1)


A more common sextuple leave that has emerged is the cross-peg leave and laying up on the West boundary - this leave is definitely more difficult to achieve as it requires very tight control of the balls around the peg.  



More common SXP leave


There are two general ways to make this leave:

Similar to making the DSL but after running H6, rush the reception ball right on-top of the peg and complete the delicate wiring
Obtain forward rush after H5 on the reception ball and complete the wiring after H5, then rush partner to H6


The first option is a more standard approach but gives no room for error.  The second option has the advantage that the crucial rush of the opponent ball towards the peg is being done from several yards closer i.e. there is more scope for accuracy, and also if the wiring is imperfect after H5 then you have the opportunity to correct it after making H6.  This method of cross-wiring at the peg after H5 means that you should have no pioneer at H6, but instead should arrange to have partner ball about 1 yard directly north of the peg so that it can be rushed to H6 after completing the wiring. 
When there is a stronger case for the opponent playing with a particular ball, such as when the opponent's clips are H1 and 4-back, or perhaps rover and peg, then it is likely that they will be playing their backward ball regardless of the leave.  Realistically there is nothing you can do to force your opponent to play a particular ball, but you should try and ensure that if they miss with the ball they want to play, you should gain an extra benefit from it.  With this in mind then, a strong sextuple leave could be as follows:



A strong SXP leave by blue for black, if red wants to take the lift


This leave is not as easy to make and normally requires placing balls in critical positions after scoring the final hoop of the turn (H6), but does give a strong chance of getting an early 1-back peel - this type of head-start to a sextuple can be a huge advantage.  In the below image, if the short lift from B-Baulk is missed with the opponent's backward ball, you have the opportunity to rush partner into peeling position at 1-back and peel it before H1 while gaining a rush on the opponent's 4-back ball to H1.  If the rush to peeling position fails, you are still in a strong position to peel 1-back before H2, which in itself is a good head-start to your SXP.  
Having the opponent ball in a sort of reverse NSL position (approximately 1 foot south-west of H2 wired from B-Baulk) can also be useful if you manage a 3rd turn break to 1-back as it puts you in the same position as the previous 1-back leave in which you were trying to take advantage of a miss with the opponent's backward ball.

Croquet can be a very deep game and the learning process is a continual one.  The plan for this section of the site is to host a collection of standalone articles, which will be added to over time.  These articles aim to go into a lot of detail, probably more-so than the higher-level sections on the previous page, in order to cover the finer points of croquet.

Peeling


Peeling
Peeling is the act of scoring points for a ball other than your own ball.  At first peeling may seem quite a novel concept but as you progress as a croquet player, it becomes a much more crucial and integral part of the game.  
When most people think of peeling, they would think of scoring points for their partner ball.  However it is also possible to score points for the opponent balls in the same way - indeed there are often tactical reasons for doing so.  We will cover all this below.
Peel types
Peeling includes some terminology which is important to become familiar with:
Standard peel - the standard peel takes place when the striker and the peelee ball are for different hoops - the peelee is peeled with a croquet stroke and then the striker roquets another ball that has been placed close-by (known as the escape ball), normally in the direction of the break

Rush peel - a rush peel is what you would expect - a peel that is done using a rush instead of a croquet stroke.  Normally this would be done on a ball that is already in the jaws, but theoretically it can be done from any distance

Straight peel - a somewhat misleading term, the straight peel does not refer to the angle at which the peel is being played, but rather refers to a peel where the striker and peelee are for the same hoop.  The peelee is peeled in the croquet stroke and the striker scores the hoop in the continuation stroke

Irish peel - like the straight peel, the Irish peel is a peel where both peelee and striker are for the same hoop.  In the Irish peel, the croquet stroke is played more firmly and both balls score the hoop in the same stroke



            Tap to see to see an animation of an Irish peel


You may also hear reference to something called a posthumous peel in game commentary or books.  A posthumous peel is not a way of playing a peel but rather refers to the point during a turn at which the peel is completed - "posthumous" means that the peel is done after the striker's ball has already scored that hoop, meaning that the game will not finish in the current turn.

Pull
Pull is an interesting phenomenon which adds to the challenge of peeling.  If you have ever looked closely at a croquet ball, you will have noticed that there is a fine milling pattern of concentric circles on it.  It is this milling pattern which both helps the balls to grip against one another in a croquet stroke and also to grip the ground.  As a result, a croquet stroke played with any amount of split will impart some "pull" onto the forward ball, meaning that it will be "pulled" slightly in the direction of the angle of split.  Experienced players allow for this subconsciously on croquet strokes throughout a break, however it is with peeling that pull requires a bit of extra thought. 



Blue is pulled off line by the split and the peel fails


A number of factors contribute to the severity of pull:

Make and age of balls - softer balls such as Barlow GTs will have more grip and consequently impart more pull than harder balls like Dawson Internationals.  Older balls will tend to pull less than newer balls as the milling slightly wears down over time.  On the other hand, brand new balls may still have remnants of the  silicon coating used to remove them from the factory moulds and consequently be more slippery and less prone to pull. 
Grass type - on coarse grass, the effects of pull are more  pronounced because any side-spin imparted on the ball is more liable to grip the ground and throw it off-line
Weather - in very hot weather, the balls can soften and here you can expect more pull than on a colder day.  In inclement weather when the ground is wet, there is less friction, so again you can expect slightly less pull
Angle of split - this is something that the striker has direct control over.  In general, and up to a point, the greater than angle of split then the more pull is applied.  From personal experience, this is true up to about 35 degrees, after which the effects of pull tend to lessen. 
Degree of "roll" - again something controlled by the striker - some players have different feelings on this however for me personally, I find that stop shots and drives impart the most pull whereas hitting down (adding "roll") on the stroke will lessen the effect somewhat.

There will always be an element of guess work involved in judging pull, but like with anything, the more you practise it, the more familiar you will become with it.  In order to be most successful at peels, you can look for opportunities to avoid pull on peels altogether - to do this, you must carefully plan the position of the other balls, which we will look at next. 

The escape ball
The "escape ball" is another ball (in addition to the striker's ball and the peelee ball) involved in most peels.  In the shots leading up to a peel, it is placed near the hoop to be peeled, and then after the peel, the escape ball will be roqueted by the striker - often rushed in the direction of the striker's break.  Positioning of the escape ball is just as important as positioning of the peelee - where it is placed will dictate the manner in which you can play the peel.  
        
The easiest and most accurate way to play a peel is with a straight croquet stroke, as this forgoes the need to allow for any pull.  In the lead-up to a peel, you must evaluate the positions of the balls and decide accordingly on how you wish to play.  Letâ€™s take a 4-back peel after hoop 3 as an example of this:
Blue has just run hoop 3 and is peeling red through 4-back while gaining a rush on black which is acting as the escape ball.  Due to the position of black, if blue wants a rush on black after the peel then it must be played as a split croquet stroke.  This is not the end of the world, but playing a peel with pull is invariably less accurate than playing it straight and there is a good chance that the peel will stick in the jaws, or even bounce out of the hoop completely.  From close range this is less likely, but is magnified if the peel is from further away and/or from an angled position. 



Blue is lining up to peel  red through the hoop and gain a rush down the court on black.  In order to gain a rush on black, the peel must be played with pull


What you need to weigh-up is whether blue actually needs a dolly rush southwards on black after the peel attempt, or whether a cut-rush in a south-westerly direction will suffice.  In order to decide this, then you should firstly look at your hoop 4 pioneer - if it is a good pioneer, perhaps 1 yard in front of hoop 4, then the answer is probably no - any cut rush south should suffice to continue your break. With this in mind, in the example below, black has deliberately been placed around 3-4 feet South-West of 4-back so that blue can peel red with a straight stop shot without worrying about positioning of blue, and automatically obtain a cut rush down towards hoop 4 where the next pioneer is waiting.  
        



Blue is lining up to peel red through the hoop and gain a rush down the court on black.  The peel can be played straight due to a well-placed black


Other things to take into account would be if 4-back is a particularly firm hoop and you want to ensure that your peel will at least finish in the jaws or better, or whether you expect you will need to be playing the peel from a long and/or angled position.  If you have placed the peelee in front of its hoop and are playing your hoop 3 approach off what will become the escape ball, you will be able to make a call at that stage based on the positioning of the peelee.  
        
Sometimes you may even consider that the peel is more important than obtaining any rush at all on the escape ball.  Choose this line of play with caution and check the following points - you should have a good hoop 4 pioneer, you should have a compelling reason to value the peel more than the break, and you should be very confident with your croquet strokes.

Straight Rover Peel
A good example peel to look at now would be what is probably the most commonly-faced peel at all levels of croquet - the straight rover peel.  It is a peel (normally on partner) through rover, immediately followed by running rover yourself, gaining a rush to the peg and pegging out to win the game.  Often referred to as the "most difficult peel", but don't let that put you off - there is nothing physically difficult about peeling a ball through rover and then running it yourself; rather, the reason it so often comes to grief is simply because players do not identify the potential risks and pitfalls well in advance, and hence do not play to avoid them accordingly. 
How to play the peel
Ideally, before you even run penult with your ball, you should have partner (peelee) already in a good position at rover waiting to be peeled.  It is at this point that you need to assess exactly how  you intend to play the peel.  If partner is in a very good position - say 1-2 feet straight in front of the hoop - then you can reasonably expect that you will be peeling rover from very close position (probably only a few inches away) and your best bet is to play an Irish peel (see top of page for more details if needed).  If peelee is further out - say 5-6 feet straight, or perhaps even slightly off to one side or the other, then you are much less likely to end up peeling from a close and straight position, and so it is far safer to play the peel as a straight peel (as opposed to an Irish).  This initial assessment should dictate where you place the escape balls.  



Blue is peeling black through rover.  On the left, the peel will be Irish from short distance, and so yellow is kept close; on the right, the peel will be played straight and so yellow is a "deep" ball near the south boundary



Escape balls for straight rover peel
Ideally for a straight rover peel, you should have both of the opponent balls available as escape balls.  Based on your assessment of how you intend to play the peel, your escape balls should be placed accordingly.  Peeling from very close position, you should standardly place one escape ball 1-2 feet directly east or west of rover, and the other escape ball about 1-2 yards almost directly south of rover (preferably very slightly off-straight).
If, on the other hand, you are less sure about peeling from a close position, you should still keep one ball 1-2 feet east or west of rover and instead place the other ball close to the south boundary, perhaps 2-3 yards from the yardline directly south of rover.



Blue and black Irish peels at rover.  In the left image, the striker (blue) has just run rover to a point clear of the jaws and is wired from yellow but has a free swing at red; on the right, blue has just run rover but is still in the hoop and is wired from red but open on yellow



The peel
When playing an Irish peel from close range, the stroke should be played as a drive and quite firmly, so that the peelee will stay on the court by about 3-4 yards if the peel catches no wire whatsoever.  With the escape balls well-placed, so long as the striker's ball either runs the hoop or is able to run the hoop with the continuation stroke, there is almost nothing that can go wrong.  Whichever point your striker's ball runs the hoop to, you should have a free swing on at least one of the escape balls.  
When playing the straight peel (peeling with croquet stroke then running hoop with continuation stroke), your starting position will generally be further away - in the example of a 3-4 foot peel, you should play the peel as a stop shot, being mindful to leave your striker's ball at least 18-24 inches back from rover in order to run the hoop in the next shot. If you have peeled partner cleanly through rover by a few yards, you should then be able to run rover gently and roquet the escape ball beside rover.  Leaving your striker's ball at least 18" back from rover before running it is critical in order to give enough room to run the hoop with a jump stroke (or half jump stroke), if the peelee happens to stick in the hoop.  Not having enough room between striker's ball and peelee to play a jump stroke is one of the most common ways that this peel comes to grief.  Having the jump stroke as an available option for a jawsed peel should make it clear why one of the escape balls was placed near to the south boundary earlier - so that the jump stroke can run rover to the south boundary and have a ball in close proximity to roquet, effectively as a reception ball.  
If you are playing the rover peel from a fairly long and angled position - say 3 feet @ 30 degrees - then while things are certainly getting more desperate, there is another option is available to you known as the Jaws and Jump method. 



Blue's peel is from a difficult angle so is attempting the Jaws & Jump method.  Note:  not to scale



With this method, you will play the peel attempt as a stop shot once again, but this time allowing for pull on the peelee.  The intention is to try and jaws the peelee (peeling it if you are lucky) and at the same time gain a ~2 foot straight hoop for the striker's ball in order to play a jump stroke through rover.
Peeling rover after a full jump
You might think that if you have jawsed the rover peel and then done a full jump over it, your chances of finishing the game in that turn are slim, but actually there is an option available to complete the peel using a cannon and gaining a rush to the peg to win.
After roqueting the escape ball near the south boundary, you may find yourself taking croquet from it at a position somewhere north of rover - this is perfect as it enables you to line up the croqueted ball to bombard onto the peelee that is in rover, causing it to score the hoop, while you get a rush on the second escape ball that is close to rover.  From there it is a simple case to get a rush on partner towards the peg and peg out.   



        Tap to play.  The arrow indicates in which direction rover must be run. Blue has made rover already with a full jump and rushed yellow back north of rover to bombard black through


More common though is that you have roqueted the south boundary escape ball to somewhere random on the court where a bombard is not available to you.  In this case you will need to try and bombard peelee through rover with the escape ball that is already close to rover.  You should try and obtain a good rush on the rover escape ball to a position about 1 foot north of rover and slightly to one side or the other.  Line up the croquet stroke to bombard peelee through rover (remembering to allow for pull), and play the stroke as a full or pass roll so that the striker's ball finishes south of the peelee.  It's probable that you won't have a dolly rush to the peg, but you at least have a good chance at roqueting partner in the direction of the peg and pegging out.

More advanced peels
Peeling in croquet is such a big topic, with some peeling manoeuvres requiring their own separate articles.  In the future, I intend to write some articles about more advanced topics like standard and delayed triple peels, and other manoeuvres such as sextuple peels.

Mallets


Mallets
Croquet mallets have changed considerably over the last 20-30 years. In the entire history of croquet
                up until around the 1990s, you would be hard pressed to find a mallet that wasn't completely made
                from wood, save for some kind of toughened material on the striking faces. In the late 90s to early
                2000s a number of new mallets hit the market incorporating peripheral weighting (a concept borrowed
                from golf) and a number of fancy new materials such as carbon fibre. Nowadays, peripherally-weighted
                carbon fibre mallets dominate, and their effect on the game has considerably changed the ability of
                players world-wide.



Modern carbon mallets often use a square cross-section of carbon
                        tube with brass weights directly behind the striking face
                    


When choosing a mallet there are a few factors to consider:

Handle length
Head length
Mallet weight
Head width
Handle alignment
Materials

Handle length
A "standard" mallet that you may find in the shed of a croquet club is normally 1 yard long (36inches
                / 91cm). The reasons for this is that it is a somewhat happy-medium length and can mostly be used by
                anyone, and conveniently is a useful marker for lining balls onto the yardline. However a standard
                mallet length is seldom the correct length for most players - the correct length is very much
                dictated both by your height and your grip. For example, a tall Solomon-grip player may require a
                very long mallet of 42" or more in order to swing comfortably; conversely a shorter player that uses
                Irish grip may be a lot more comfortable with a handle length of 30".
                In general, Solomon grip players require the longest handle; Irish grip the shortest; Standard grip
                somewhere in between, but again comfort has a lot to do with this choice.
Head length
This is one area where the standard specification has changed over the years. 20-30 years ago, most
                mallet heads were around 9" in length. Over the years this has increased and it is now quite common
                to see top players using a 12" head. Most club players will also be using heads of 10"+. The head
                length you choose can have a big effect on the arc of your swing - the longer the head, the flatter
                the swing needs to be in order to have a clean strike on the ball. When switching from one head
                length to another (particularly when going from a shorter to a longer head) there will be a period
                of adjustment while your swing and technique adjusts to the new length. Generally a longer head will
                be more accurate for hitting a ball in a straight line, both because aiming with a longer head is
                easier, and also because a longer head will naturally mean that some mass is distributed further
                from the axis of rotation (the handle). On the other hand a shorter head will give you better stop
                shot ratios and generally make it easier to control the back ball in these types of stroke. 



A shorter mallet head will make it much easier to play stop shots by enabling a more acute upward angle to the ball 
                        


Head width
This is a less critical decision and more a matter of personal preference. Shot outcomes and croquet
                stroke ratios are not affected by the head width in any way. Some top players use mallets with very
                narrow heads which may be little more than 2 inches wide because they are very confident of striking
                the ball with the centre of the mallet face. On the other hand, a wider head width would be
                recommended for a new player as it would probably result in a lower number of mis-hits.  The
                one area where a narrower mallet head can provide a true advantage is with hampered shots - for
                example if you run a hoop but the hoop ends up hampering your next shot - sometimes the attempted
                roquet would be played with the mallet head between the uprights of a hoop, and a narrower mallet
                will assist with this. 
Head shape
A croquet mallet 100 years ago would likely have had a circular wooden head. However these went out
                of fashion a long time ago in favour of a square cross section. In reality there is no difference in
                the playing characteristics between square and round, but the square section has a couple of minor
                advantages. Firstly and most obviously, the square mallet can stand up on its own. Secondly,
                severely hampered shots are slightly easier with a square endface. Finally, if a player mis-hits a
                ball by catching the ball with the bottom edge of the striking face, the shot is much more likely to
                still go in a straight line with the square face compared with the round face.

Interestingly, around the turn of the millennium, there was a resurgence in popularity for
                round-headed mallets - not due to fashion, but rather due to the emergence of carbon fibre in mallet
                manufacture. Carbon tubing is most easily and cheaply manufactured in a circular tube shape and
                hence this was the shape that many early carbon fibre mallets took on. In recent years, square
                carbon has become more readily available, and as a result we are seeing fewer circular mallets.
Mallet weight
This is a very important factor. Standardly a croquet mallet is around 3lbs. A heavier mallet will make
                it easier to hit a ball in a straight line, and also make playing half rolls, full rolls and pass
                rolls easier; a lighter mallet will have the opposite effect and will give more control and better
                stop shot ratios. When choosing a mallet weight, it is important to try out a number of different mallets to find what works most comfortably for you.  Generally players will look to choose a mallet weight which gives a good compromise between accuracy of touch (lighter) and accuracy of shooting (heavier).
As well as the overall weight of the mallet, another factor in this is the balance
                point. Traditional wooden mallets would have a balance point of around 1:5, meaning that if you balance the
                mallet sideways on your finger, it would balance around 1/5th of the way between the head and the
                end of the handle. In recent years, the fashion has been towards mallets with lighter, carbon fibre handles that have more of the overall weight concentrated in the mallet head, and consequently a balance point of around 1:8 or 1:10 (or even higher) - this enables a pendulum swing to be achieved more easily, as the majority of the weight will be concentrated at the extremities and far from the hands.  
Handle alignment
This is a factor which is usually overlooked, but nonetheless it should be given some thought. Generally a mallet handle when viewed from above
                will be oval or a rounded rectangle shape. It is possible to request a mallet manufacturer to offset
                the rotational alignment of the handle so that the handle is aligned in a position that is most
                comfortable in the hands.



Comparison of mallet handle alignment as seen from above.  Top - mallet handle is not offset;  bottom - handle is offset by 45 degrees
                        


To find your optimal alignment, pick up a mallet with your eyes closed,
                and hold the handle in the most comfortable position possible - chances are when you open your eyes,
                the mallet head will not be pointing directly forwards. A number of top players, such as Reg Bamford
                advocate an offset rotational alignment. 
Peripheral weighting and moment of inertia
Not as complicated as it sounds. This is a concept that aims to concentrate the majority of the weight of the
                mallet in the head, but particularly at the extremities of the head (the striking faces), in theory enabling the mallet to swing more easily in
                a straight line, and also reducing the impact of an off-centre strike. This concept has been in use in croquet for decades, and any mallet, regardless of the construction material, can benefit from it.
                For a wooden mallet, this could be achieved by the manufacturer drilling out sections of the
                underside of the mallet head that are near to the axis of rotation (the handle) and adding
                the weight back in (via brass / tungsten plugs) closer to the extremities of the head. This concept has
                been taken to the extreme by the use of carbon fibre mallets, where the entire mallet head is
                essentially a hollow tube or box (sometimes filled with foam or a dampening material to improve the
                sound), with 90%+ of the head weight being confined to brass or steel plates just behind the
                striking face - or in some cases acting as the striking face itself.



Modern aluminium mallets have large holes near the middle
                            of
                            the head and weights added near the extremities to maximise the moment of inertia
                        


Materials
Years ago, a traditional mallet would have been constructed entirely of wood. Lignum Vitae, the
                densest wood is
                an ideal candidate - it is a wood dense enough to withstand continued striking of a
                croquet ball without the need for an additional endface to be attached - although for added
                protection and to stop the wood from splitting, the Lignum would normally have a brass ring wrapped
                around
                its circumference near the end. Most wooden mallets are made from less expensive and less dense
                woods, such as
                rosewood, and use tufnol or other hardened materials for the actual striking face. Actually, from a
                peripheral weighting perspective, it is advantageous to use a less-dense wood for the mallet head,
                as it means that extra brass or steel weighting can be added directly to the extremities of the head in
                order to
                bring it up to its chosen overall weight.
                For a wooden handle, ash is a popular choice for its flexibility and durability.
While wood is still a very popular choice for mallet material, today we see more and more mallets
                being made of more futuristic materials such as aluminium, graphite and carbon fibre. Using these
                light and strong materials allows peripheral weighting to be incorporated into the manufacturing
                process itself.

Below is a list of frequently-asked questions.  If you would like to refer to a glossary of terms, then this is available on a separate page, here:
Go To Glossary

The basics





                  What's the difference between Croquet and Association Croquet?
                




The sport of "association croquet" is usually referred to simply as "croquet".  There are a number of other mallet sports which can fall under the umbrella term of "croquet" too, however association croquet (along with its very similar US cousin known as "US Rules Croquet") is the only mallet sport which utilises the "croquet" stroke with which the sport shares its name.  







                  How easy is it to start playing croquet?
                




Starting croquet is very easy indeed! Simply find your local club and either phone them to arrange a time for a lesson (normally free), or even pop in to the club when players are present and enquire about the game. The croquet community is friendly and welcoming, and the sport is very much not-for-profit.







                  How much does it cost?
                




Croquet is a very reasonable sport to play. Initially you will require nothing more than a good pair of trainers (spikes / heels are not allowed on the court). For your first few months in the game, you will be able to use a club-supplied mallet free of charge. After a while playing the game, you will get a feel for the type of mallet you prefer, at which point you will probably choose to purchase your own mallet. Mallets range in price from around $200 (NZD) to over $800 for a top-of-the-line Carbon Fibre model. Club membership fees are very reasonable when compared with other sports - you are looking at around $200-$600 per year for subscription fees. That's it!







                  What mallet should I buy?
                




If you are new to croquet, don't buy a mallet immediately.  Experiment with different techniques until you find what works for  you, and with different mallet lengths and weights.  Most club mallets are free to       borrow for extended periods of time.  Club mallets will also mostly be wooden, without particularly fancy concepts like peripheral weighting.  My advice is to learn to hit a ball in the centre of the mallet regularly and to play a range of strokes with a wooden mallet - this is a great way to learn initially, as any off-centre strike with a wooden mallet will be more pronounced and will teach you to hit more consistently. I currently play with a Dave Trimmer mallet and I highly recommend them once you have established your technique.







                  Where is my local club?
                




Check out the Links section of this website and visit the homepage of your country's croquet organisation - it should have links and contacts to your local club.







                  Isn't croquet just for old people?
                




Not at all.  While a high number of older people play croquet (just as they play golf, bowls, tennis etc.) it is by no means simply a sport for old people.  Like most sports, croquet at the elite level is dominated by players in their 20s and 30s; however, because croquet is a game of strategy as well as skill, with no requirement for speed or reflexes, there are a number of players over 50 and even over 60 who still compete at the highest level.  Stephen Mulliner became world champion for the first time at the age of 62 after starting his croquet career in his 20s!







                  Why play croquet?
                




Croquet is a serious but fun sport played by all ages and genders, all around the world.  It is easy to learn but challenging to master.  It provides excellent mental and physical exercise and a fun yet competitive environment.







                  How do you pronounce "croquet"?
                




In New Zealand, the name of the sport is often pronounced "CROAK-ee", whereas in the UK it tends to be pronounced as "CRO-kay".  In the USA, the emphasis is generally placed on the second syllable - "cro-KAY".




The game





                What is a triple peel?
              




A triple peel (or sometimes a TP for short) is a manoeuvre performed by experienced players whereby they make all their hoops for their own ball, and score the final 3 hoops for their partner ball in the same turn, and win the game.







                How are the scores denoted?
              




The winner of a game is the first side to reach 26 points (or the side which has scored more points after the time limit has elapsed).  In most countries the score is denoted fully e.g. 26-0 or 26-17.  In the UK alone, the score is denoted in a way to show the winning margin e.g. +26 is the same as 26-0 and +9 is the same as 26-17.







                How wide are the hoops?
              




Croquet hoops at club level have a 3-3/4" (three & three-quarter inches) gap for the ball to pass through. A croquet ball is 3-5/8" (three & five-eighths of an inch) wide, meaning there is 1/8th of an inch of clearance between the hoop and the ball.  Hoops at championship level (regional / national etc.) are normally set to have a 3-11/16" (three & eleven-sixteenths of an inch) gap, leaving 1/16th of an inch clearance for the ball.  Depending on the age of the balls used, there could be slight differences in the sizes, and therefore the hoops are often not set to a specific width, but are instead set to the size of the largest ball +1/16th of an inch.  Sometimes this is even reduced to +1/32nd of an inch.







                What is the court "speed"?
              




Croquet courts are measured in seconds (or "Plummers") to denote how fast or slow they are. A court will be timed to see how long it takes for a ball hit from the south boundary, coming to rest on the north boundary. A fast court will only require a gentle tap of the ball to reach from one end to the other, and hence the ball will roll more slowly and take longer to reach its destination.  For a slow court, the opposite is true. Most average courts are about 10-11 seconds.  A slow court would be 8 or 9 seconds; a fast court would be 12 or 13 seconds.  Some may be even faster than this.  A court in the range of 9-12 seconds is generally regarded as "easy". Courts above 12 seconds are less forgiving of poor strokes, and as such tend to reward more skillful players.

              Why is this site called CroquetDev?
            




CroquetDev was the name for this site in the "dev" environment.  I intended to change the name, but I actually kinda grew to like it, so it has stuck.







              Where do I get more detail on any aspects of croquet not covered by this site?
            




I fully appreciate that this site doesn't cover all aspects of association croquet (at least not yet).  My intention is to add far more content over the course of time.  If you have a request for a specific article, please contact me using the link in the menu and I'll see what I can do.

Glossary
Like most sports, croquet has its own terminology which can seem strange and incomprehensible at first.  Below are some terms you are likely to see, or hear around croquet.  
If you are looking for a word, type it below to refine




Term
Definition



      2 ball break
    
      A break involving your ball, and only one other ball.  This is by far the most difficult break to play, and even elite players often struggle to make more than a few hoops at a time with only 2 balls
    


      3 ball break
    
      A break involving 3 balls, which is significantly easier than the 2-ball break.  It uses the concept of the pioneer ball (ball at your next hoop-but-one)
    


      4 ball break
    
      A break involving 4 balls, and is the easiest break to play.  This break involves pioneer balls and pivot balls.
    


      9-12-5
    
      Term used to describe a game being won with 3 breaks and no errors, and usually no attempt at a TP.  Break of 9 with first ball; break of 12 with second ball; break of 3 + 2 peg points with first ball.
    


      AC
    
      Abbreviation for Association Croquet
    


      Advanced (game)
    
      Meaning a "level" game between two players whereby lifts are conceded after 1-back and 4-back, and no bisques are given.
    


      Anti-Duffer
    
      A first-turn shot where the player hits their ball to a point a few yards in from the East boundary, around peg-high or sometimes slightly further North.  Discourages the second-turn Duffer response from the opponent
    


      Aspinall Peel
    
      Peel popularised by Nigel Aspinall.  This is played to deliberately jaws the peelee ball (often due to acute angle) and in the same shot have the striker's ball catch up to the jawsed ball and knock it through, normally with the striker's ball richocheting off safely to the side
    


      Atkins
    
      Common nickname for Quadway hoops, in reference to the creator, Ray Atkins
    


      B
    
      Abbreviation for the blue ball
    


      Baulk Line
    
      An unmarked line which extends from corner 1 to the South boundary level with hoop 5 ("A Baulk"), and corner 3 to the North boundary level with hoop 6 ("B Baulk"). 
    


      Bisque
    
      In a handicap game, bisques are given to the weaker player based on the difference between the two players' handicaps.  A bisque is 1 extra turn
    


      Break
    
      Scoring multiple hoops in a single turn
    


      Bryant Standard Leave / BSL
    
      Leave made popular by Greg Bryant of New Zealand.  Consists of a break to 4-back with striker's ball, leaving one opponent ball about 1 inch North of hoop 1, not visible from A Baulk, and the other ball a few inches North-East of hoop 4
    


      Cannon
    
      A shot normally played from a corner, with 3 (and occasionally 4) balls involved.  Each ball is in contact with one of the other balls.  Usually a cannon will send out a pioneer ball and make a roquet in the same shot.
    


      Carrot
    
      The carrot-shaped section of the hoop that is sunk into the ground
    


      Clip
    
      A metal or plastic coloured clip which is placed onto the top of the hoops (for hoop 1 through to 6) or the side (from 1-back through to rover) to denote which hoop a given ball is for.
    


      Contact
    
      A penalty given to the opponent when the striker scores 1-back and 4-back in the same turn before the partner ball has scored 1-back.  The opponent may start their turn by taking contact (taking croquet) from any ball on the court.

      A small stick placed on each boundary exactly 1 yard from the corner, to show where the corner area starts and ends
    


      Critical distance / CD
    
      This is used to refer to the distance at which a player will hit 50% of their shots.  Top players may have a CD of 13 yards or more
    


      Croquet (shot)
    
      This is the shot that follows a roquet and preceeds a continuation shot.  It is played with two balls in contact, and the striker's ball is struck so that both balls move
    


      Croqueted ball
    
      Refers to a ball that the striker's ball is taking croquet from
    


      Crosswire
    
      The act of arranging two balls to be wired (blocked) from one another - often a player will arrange for both opponent balls to be crosswired at the partner ball's hoop
    


      Crown
    
      The horizontal bar at the top of a hoop
    


      Cut rush

      Death Roll
    
      Roll shot where a ball is peeled through Penult while striker's ball goes to a pioneer at 2-back.  Can also be used to describe the same shot, but with striker's ball going to pioneer at 3-back. Normally part of a TP or TPO
    


      Delayed DP / Delayed Double
    
      Refers to a manoeuvre of peeling penult before making 4-back and finishing with a straight rover peel.  Normally part of a TP or TPO
    


      Delayed TP / Delayed Triple
    
      Refers to a TP in which the 4-back peel is not peeled or jawsed after hoop 3, but is peeled later in the turn (normally before hoop 6).  It is a much more difficult turn than a standard TP
    


      Diagonal Spread

Below is a list of frequently-asked questions.  If you would like to refer to a glossary of terms, then this is available on a separate page, here:

The basics





                  What's the difference between Croquet and Association Croquet?
                




The sport of "association croquet" is usually referred to simply as "croquet".  There are a number of other mallet sports which can fall under the umbrella term of "croquet" too, however association croquet (along with its very similar US cousin known as "US Rules Croquet") is the only mallet sport which utilises the "croquet" stroke with which the sport shares its name.  







                  How easy is it to start playing croquet?
                




Starting croquet is very easy indeed! Simply find your local club and either phone them to arrange a time for a lesson (normally free), or even pop in to the club when players are present and enquire about the game. The croquet community is friendly and welcoming, and the sport is very much not-for-profit.







                  How much does it cost?
                




Croquet is a very reasonable sport to play. Initially you will require nothing more than a good pair of trainers (spikes / heels are not allowed on the court). For your first few months in the game, you will be able to use a club-supplied mallet free of charge. After a while playing the game, you will get a feel for the type of mallet you prefer, at which point you will probably choose to purchase your own mallet. Mallets range in price from around $200 (NZD) to over $800 for a top-of-the-line Carbon Fibre model. Club membership fees are very reasonable when compared with other sports - you are looking at around $200-$600 per year for subscription fees. That's it!







                  What mallet should I buy?
                




If you are new to croquet, don't buy a mallet immediately.  Experiment with different techniques until you find what works for  you, and with different mallet lengths and weights.  Most club mallets are free to       borrow for extended periods of time.  Club mallets will also mostly be wooden, without particularly fancy concepts like peripheral weighting.  My advice is to learn to hit a ball in the centre of the mallet regularly and to play a range of strokes with a wooden mallet - this is a great way to learn initially, as any off-centre strike with a wooden mallet will be more pronounced and will teach you to hit more consistently. I currently play with a Dave Trimmer mallet and I highly recommend them once you have established your technique.







                  Where is my local club?
                




Check out the Links section of this website and visit the homepage of your country's croquet organisation - it should have links and contacts to your local club.







                  Isn't croquet just for old people?
                




Not at all.  While a high number of older people play croquet (just as they play golf, bowls, tennis etc.) it is by no means simply a sport for old people.  Like most sports, croquet at the elite level is dominated by players in their 20s and 30s; however, because croquet is a game of strategy as well as skill, with no requirement for speed or reflexes, there are a number of players over 50 and even over 60 who still compete at the highest level.  Stephen Mulliner became world champion for the first time at the age of 62 after starting his croquet career in his 20s!







                  Why play croquet?
                




Croquet is a serious but fun sport played by all ages and genders, all around the world.  It is easy to learn but challenging to master.  It provides excellent mental and physical exercise and a fun yet competitive environment.







                  How do you pronounce "croquet"?
                




In New Zealand, the name of the sport is often pronounced "CROAK-ee", whereas in the UK it tends to be pronounced as "CRO-kay".  In the USA, the emphasis is generally placed on the second syllable - "cro-KAY".




The game





                What is a triple peel?
              




A triple peel (or sometimes a TP for short) is a manoeuvre performed by experienced players whereby they make all their hoops for their own ball, and score the final 3 hoops for their partner ball in the same turn, and win the game.







                How are the scores denoted?
              




The winner of a game is the first side to reach 26 points (or the side which has scored more points after the time limit has elapsed).  In most countries the score is denoted fully e.g. 26-0 or 26-17.  In the UK alone, the score is denoted in a way to show the winning margin e.g. +26 is the same as 26-0 and +9 is the same as 26-17.







                How wide are the hoops?
              




Croquet hoops at club level have a 3-3/4" (three & three-quarter inches) gap for the ball to pass through. A croquet ball is 3-5/8" (three & five-eighths of an inch) wide, meaning there is 1/8th of an inch of clearance between the hoop and the ball.  Hoops at championship level (regional / national etc.) are normally set to have a 3-11/16" (three & eleven-sixteenths of an inch) gap, leaving 1/16th of an inch clearance for the ball.  Depending on the age of the balls used, there could be slight differences in the sizes, and therefore the hoops are often not set to a specific width, but are instead set to the size of the largest ball +1/16th of an inch.  Sometimes this is even reduced to +1/32nd of an inch.







                What is the court "speed"?
              




Croquet courts are measured in seconds (or "Plummers") to denote how fast or slow they are. A court will be timed to see how long it takes for a ball hit from the south boundary, coming to rest on the north boundary. A fast court will only require a gentle tap of the ball to reach from one end to the other, and hence the ball will roll more slowly and take longer to reach its destination.  For a slow court, the opposite is true. Most average courts are about 10-11 seconds.  A slow court would be 8 or 9 seconds; a fast court would be 12 or 13 seconds.  Some may be even faster than this.  A court in the range of 9-12 seconds is generally regarded as "easy". Courts above 12 seconds are less forgiving of poor strokes, and as such tend to reward more skillful players.




This site





              Why is this site called CroquetDev?
            




CroquetDev was the name for this site in the "dev" environment.  I intended to change the name, but I actually kinda grew to like it, so it has stuck.







              Where do I get more detail on any aspects of croquet not covered by this site?
            




I fully appreciate that this site doesn't cover all aspects of association croquet (at least not yet).  My intention is to add far more content over the course of time.  If you have a request for a specific article, please contact me using the link in the menu and I'll see what I can do.

A triple peel (or sometimes a TP for short) is a manoeuvre performed by experienced players whereby they make all their hoops for their own ball, and score the final 3 hoops for their partner ball in the same turn, and win the game.







                How are the scores denoted?
              




The winner of a game is the first side to reach 26 points (or the side which has scored more points after the time limit has elapsed).  In most countries the score is denoted fully e.g. 26-0 or 26-17.  In the UK alone, the score is denoted in a way to show the winning margin e.g. +26 is the same as 26-0 and +9 is the same as 26-17.







                How wide are the hoops?
              




Croquet hoops at club level have a 3-3/4" (three & three-quarter inches) gap for the ball to pass through. A croquet ball is 3-5/8" (three & five-eighths of an inch) wide, meaning there is 1/8th of an inch of clearance between the hoop and the ball.  Hoops at championship level (regional / national etc.) are normally set to have a 3-11/16" (three & eleven-sixteenths of an inch) gap, leaving 1/16th of an inch clearance for the ball.  Depending on the age of the balls used, there could be slight differences in the sizes, and therefore the hoops are often not set to a specific width, but are instead set to the size of the largest ball +1/16th of an inch.  Sometimes this is even reduced to +1/32nd of an inch.







                What is the court "speed"?
              




Croquet courts are measured in seconds (or "Plummers") to denote how fast or slow they are. A court will be timed to see how long it takes for a ball hit from the south boundary, coming to rest on the north boundary. A fast court will only require a gentle tap of the ball to reach from one end to the other, and hence the ball will roll more slowly and take longer to reach its destination.  For a slow court, the opposite is true. Most average courts are about 10-11 seconds.  A slow court would be 8 or 9 seconds; a fast court would be 12 or 13 seconds.  Some may be even faster than this.  A court in the range of 9-12 seconds is generally regarded as "easy". Courts above 12 seconds are less forgiving of poor strokes, and as such tend to reward more skillful players.

The basics





                  What's the difference between Croquet and Association Croquet?
                




The sport of "association croquet" is usually referred to simply as "croquet".  There are a number of other mallet sports which can fall under the umbrella term of "croquet" too, however association croquet (along with its very similar US cousin known as "US Rules Croquet") is the only mallet sport which utilises the "croquet" stroke with which the sport shares its name.  







                  How easy is it to start playing croquet?
                




Starting croquet is very easy indeed! Simply find your local club and either phone them to arrange a time for a lesson (normally free), or even pop in to the club when players are present and enquire about the game. The croquet community is friendly and welcoming, and the sport is very much not-for-profit.







                  How much does it cost?
                




Croquet is a very reasonable sport to play. Initially you will require nothing more than a good pair of trainers (spikes / heels are not allowed on the court). For your first few months in the game, you will be able to use a club-supplied mallet free of charge. After a while playing the game, you will get a feel for the type of mallet you prefer, at which point you will probably choose to purchase your own mallet. Mallets range in price from around $200 (NZD) to over $800 for a top-of-the-line Carbon Fibre model. Club membership fees are very reasonable when compared with other sports - you are looking at around $200-$600 per year for subscription fees. That's it!







                  What mallet should I buy?
                




If you are new to croquet, don't buy a mallet immediately.  Experiment with different techniques until you find what works for  you, and with different mallet lengths and weights.  Most club mallets are free to       borrow for extended periods of time.  Club mallets will also mostly be wooden, without particularly fancy concepts like peripheral weighting.  My advice is to learn to hit a ball in the centre of the mallet regularly and to play a range of strokes with a wooden mallet - this is a great way to learn initially, as any off-centre strike with a wooden mallet will be more pronounced and will teach you to hit more consistently. I currently play with a Dave Trimmer mallet and I highly recommend them once you have established your technique.







                  Where is my local club?
                




Check out the Links section of this website and visit the homepage of your country's croquet organisation - it should have links and contacts to your local club.







                  Isn't croquet just for old people?
                




Not at all.  While a high number of older people play croquet (just as they play golf, bowls, tennis etc.) it is by no means simply a sport for old people.  Like most sports, croquet at the elite level is dominated by players in their 20s and 30s; however, because croquet is a game of strategy as well as skill, with no requirement for speed or reflexes, there are a number of players over 50 and even over 60 who still compete at the highest level.  Stephen Mulliner became world champion for the first time at the age of 62 after starting his croquet career in his 20s!







                  Why play croquet?
                




Croquet is a serious but fun sport played by all ages and genders, all around the world.  It is easy to learn but challenging to master.  It provides excellent mental and physical exercise and a fun yet competitive environment.







                  How do you pronounce "croquet"?
                




In New Zealand, the name of the sport is often pronounced "CROAK-ee", whereas in the UK it tends to be pronounced as "CRO-kay".  In the USA, the emphasis is generally placed on the second syllable - "cro-KAY".

Croquet is a very reasonable sport to play. Initially you will require nothing more than a good pair of trainers (spikes / heels are not allowed on the court).

Check out the Links section of this website and visit the homepage of your country's croquet organisation - it should have links and contacts to your local club.







                  Isn't croquet just for old people?
                




Not at all.  While a high number of older people play croquet (just as they play golf, bowls, tennis etc.) it is by no means simply a sport for old people.  Like most sports, croquet at the elite level is dominated by players in their 20s and 30s; however, because croquet is a game of strategy as well as skill, with no requirement for speed or reflexes, there are a number of players over 50 and even over 60 who still compete at the highest level.  Stephen Mulliner became world champion for the first time at the age of 62 after starting his croquet career in his 20s!







                  Why play croquet?
                




Croquet is a serious but fun sport played by all ages and genders, all around the world.  It is easy to learn but challenging to master.  It provides excellent mental and physical exercise and a fun yet competitive environment.







                  How do you pronounce "croquet"?
                




In New Zealand, the name of the sport is often pronounced "CROAK-ee", whereas in the UK it tends to be pronounced as "CRO-kay".  In the USA, the emphasis is generally placed on the second syllable - "cro-KAY".




The game





                What is a triple peel?
              




A triple peel (or sometimes a TP for short) is a manoeuvre performed by experienced players whereby they make all their hoops for their own ball, and score the final 3 hoops for their partner ball in the same turn, and win the game.







                How are the scores denoted?
              




The winner of a game is the first side to reach 26 points (or the side which has scored more points after the time limit has elapsed).  In most countries the score is denoted fully e.g. 26-0 or 26-17.  In the UK alone, the score is denoted in a way to show the winning margin e.g. +26 is the same as 26-0 and +9 is the same as 26-17.







                How wide are the hoops?
              




Croquet hoops at club level have a 3-3/4" (three & three-quarter inches) gap for the ball to pass through. A croquet ball is 3-5/8" (three & five-eighths of an inch) wide, meaning there is 1/8th of an inch of clearance between the hoop and the ball.  Hoops at championship level (regional / national etc.) are normally set to have a 3-11/16" (three & eleven-sixteenths of an inch) gap, leaving 1/16th of an inch clearance for the ball.  Depending on the age of the balls used, there could be slight differences in the sizes, and therefore the hoops are often not set to a specific width, but are instead set to the size of the largest ball +1/16th of an inch.  Sometimes this is even reduced to +1/32nd of an inch.







                What is the court "speed"?
              




Croquet courts are measured in seconds (or "Plummers") to denote how fast or slow they are. A court will be timed to see how long it takes for a ball hit from the south boundary, coming to rest on the north boundary. A fast court will only require a gentle tap of the ball to reach from one end to the other, and hence the ball will roll more slowly and take longer to reach its destination.  For a slow court, the opposite is true. Most average courts are about 10-11 seconds.  A slow court would be 8 or 9 seconds; a fast court would be 12 or 13 seconds.  Some may be even faster than this.  A court in the range of 9-12 seconds is generally regarded as "easy". Courts above 12 seconds are less forgiving of poor strokes, and as such tend to reward more skillful players.

The basics





                  What's the difference between Croquet and Association Croquet?
                




The sport of "association croquet" is usually referred to simply as "croquet".  There are a number of other mallet sports which can fall under the umbrella term of "croquet" too, however association croquet (along with its very similar US cousin known as "US Rules Croquet") is the only mallet sport which utilises the "croquet" stroke with which the sport shares its name.  







                  How easy is it to start playing croquet?
                




Starting croquet is very easy indeed! Simply find your local club and either phone them to arrange a time for a lesson (normally free), or even pop in to the club when players are present and enquire about the game. The croquet community is friendly and welcoming, and the sport is very much not-for-profit.







                  How much does it cost?
                




Croquet is a very reasonable sport to play. Initially you will require nothing more than a good pair of trainers (spikes / heels are not allowed on the court). For your first few months in the game, you will be able to use a club-supplied mallet free of charge. After a while playing the game, you will get a feel for the type of mallet you prefer, at which point you will probably choose to purchase your own mallet. Mallets range in price from around $200 (NZD) to over $800 for a top-of-the-line Carbon Fibre model. Club membership fees are very reasonable when compared with other sports - you are looking at around $200-$600 per year for subscription fees. That's it!







                  What mallet should I buy?
                




If you are new to croquet, don't buy a mallet immediately.  Experiment with different techniques until you find what works for  you, and with different mallet lengths and weights.  Most club mallets are free to       borrow for extended periods of time.  Club mallets will also mostly be wooden, without particularly fancy concepts like peripheral weighting.  My advice is to learn to hit a ball in the centre of the mallet regularly and to play a range of strokes with a wooden mallet - this is a great way to learn initially, as any off-centre strike with a wooden mallet will be more pronounced and will teach you to hit more consistently. I currently play with a Dave Trimmer mallet and I highly recommend them once you have established your technique.

There are a number of other mallet sports which can fall under the umbrella term of "croquet" too, however association croquet (along with its very similar US cousin known as "US Rules Croquet") is the only mallet sport which utilises the "croquet" stroke with which the sport shares its name.  







                  How easy is it to start playing croquet?
                




Starting croquet is very easy indeed! Simply find your local club and either phone them to arrange a time for a lesson (normally free), or even pop in to the club when players are present and enquire about the game. The croquet community is friendly and welcoming, and the sport is very much not-for-profit.







                  How much does it cost?
                




Croquet is a very reasonable sport to play. Initially you will require nothing more than a good pair of trainers (spikes / heels are not allowed on the court). For your first few months in the game, you will be able to use a club-supplied mallet free of charge. After a while playing the game, you will get a feel for the type of mallet you prefer, at which point you will probably choose to purchase your own mallet. Mallets range in price from around $200 (NZD) to over $800 for a top-of-the-line Carbon Fibre model. Club membership fees are very reasonable when compared with other sports - you are looking at around $200-$600 per year for subscription fees. That's it!







                  What mallet should I buy?
                




If you are new to croquet, don't buy a mallet immediately.  Experiment with different techniques until you find what works for  you, and with different mallet lengths and weights.  Most club mallets are free to       borrow for extended periods of time.  Club mallets will also mostly be wooden, without particularly fancy concepts like peripheral weighting.  My advice is to learn to hit a ball in the centre of the mallet regularly and to play a range of strokes with a wooden mallet - this is a great way to learn initially, as any off-centre strike with a wooden mallet will be more pronounced and will teach you to hit more consistently. I currently play with a Dave Trimmer mallet and I highly recommend them once you have established your technique.







                  Where is my local club?
                




Check out the Links section of this website and visit the homepage of your country's croquet organisation - it should have links and contacts to your local club.







                  Isn't croquet just for old people?
                




Not at all.  While a high number of older people play croquet (just as they play golf, bowls, tennis etc.) it is by no means simply a sport for old people.  Like most sports, croquet at the elite level is dominated by players in their 20s and 30s; however, because croquet is a game of strategy as well as skill, with no requirement for speed or reflexes, there are a number of players over 50 and even over 60 who still compete at the highest level.  Stephen Mulliner became world champion for the first time at the age of 62 after starting his croquet career in his 20s!







                  Why play croquet?
                




Croquet is a serious but fun sport played by all ages and genders, all around the world.  It is easy to learn but challenging to master.  It provides excellent mental and physical exercise and a fun yet competitive environment.







                  How do you pronounce "croquet"?
                




In New Zealand, the name of the sport is often pronounced "CROAK-ee", whereas in the UK it tends to be pronounced as "CRO-kay".  In the USA, the emphasis is generally placed on the second syllable - "cro-KAY".




The game





                What is a triple peel?
              




A triple peel (or sometimes a TP for short) is a manoeuvre performed by experienced players whereby they make all their hoops for their own ball, and score the final 3 hoops for their partner ball in the same turn, and win the game.







                How are the scores denoted?
              




The winner of a game is the first side to reach 26 points (or the side which has scored more points after the time limit has elapsed).  In most countries the score is denoted fully e.g. 26-0 or 26-17.  In the UK alone, the score is denoted in a way to show the winning margin e.g. +26 is the same as 26-0 and +9 is the same as 26-17.







                How wide are the hoops?
              




Croquet hoops at club level have a 3-3/4" (three & three-quarter inches) gap for the ball to pass through. A croquet ball is 3-5/8" (three & five-eighths of an inch) wide, meaning there is 1/8th of an inch of clearance between the hoop and the ball.  Hoops at championship level (regional / national etc.) are normally set to have a 3-11/16" (three & eleven-sixteenths of an inch) gap, leaving 1/16th of an inch clearance for the ball.  Depending on the age of the balls used, there could be slight differences in the sizes, and therefore the hoops are often not set to a specific width, but are instead set to the size of the largest ball +1/16th of an inch.  Sometimes this is even reduced to +1/32nd of an inch.







                What is the court "speed"?
              




Croquet courts are measured in seconds (or "Plummers") to denote how fast or slow they are. A court will be timed to see how long it takes for a ball hit from the south boundary, coming to rest on the north boundary. A fast court will only require a gentle tap of the ball to reach from one end to the other, and hence the ball will roll more slowly and take longer to reach its destination.  For a slow court, the opposite is true. Most average courts are about 10-11 seconds.  A slow court would be 8 or 9 seconds; a fast court would be 12 or 13 seconds.  Some may be even faster than this.  A court in the range of 9-12 seconds is generally regarded as "easy". Courts above 12 seconds are less forgiving of poor strokes, and as such tend to reward more skillful players.

A court will be timed to see how long it takes for a ball hit from the south boundary, coming to rest on the north boundary. A fast court will only require a gentle tap of the ball to reach from one end to the other, and hence the ball will roll more slowly and take longer to reach its destination.  For a slow court, the opposite is true. Most average courts are about 10-11 seconds.  A slow court would be 8 or 9 seconds; a fast court would be 12 or 13 seconds.  Some may be even faster than this.  A court in the range of 9-12 seconds is generally regarded as "easy". Courts above 12 seconds are less forgiving of poor strokes, and as such tend to reward more skillful players.

CroquetDev was the name for this site in the "dev" environment.  I intended to change the name, but I actually kinda grew to like it, so it has stuck.







              Where do I get more detail on any aspects of croquet not covered by this site?
            




I fully appreciate that this site doesn't cover all aspects of association croquet (at least not yet).  My intention is to add far more content over the course of time.

The basics





                  What's the difference between Croquet and Association Croquet?
                




The sport of "association croquet" is usually referred to simply as "croquet".  There are a number of other mallet sports which can fall under the umbrella term of "croquet" too, however association croquet (along with its very similar US cousin known as "US Rules Croquet") is the only mallet sport which utilises the "croquet" stroke with which the sport shares its name.  







                  How easy is it to start playing croquet?
                




Starting croquet is very easy indeed! Simply find your local club and either phone them to arrange a time for a lesson (normally free), or even pop in to the club when players are present and enquire about the game. The croquet community is friendly and welcoming, and the sport is very much not-for-profit.







                  How much does it cost?
                




Croquet is a very reasonable sport to play. Initially you will require nothing more than a good pair of trainers (spikes / heels are not allowed on the court). For your first few months in the game, you will be able to use a club-supplied mallet free of charge. After a while playing the game, you will get a feel for the type of mallet you prefer, at which point you will probably choose to purchase your own mallet. Mallets range in price from around $200 (NZD) to over $800 for a top-of-the-line Carbon Fibre model. Club membership fees are very reasonable when compared with other sports - you are looking at around $200-$600 per year for subscription fees. That's it!







                  What mallet should I buy?
                




If you are new to croquet, don't buy a mallet immediately.  Experiment with different techniques until you find what works for  you, and with different mallet lengths and weights.  Most club mallets are free to       borrow for extended periods of time.  Club mallets will also mostly be wooden, without particularly fancy concepts like peripheral weighting.  My advice is to learn to hit a ball in the centre of the mallet regularly and to play a range of strokes with a wooden mallet - this is a great way to learn initially, as any off-centre strike with a wooden mallet will be more pronounced and will teach you to hit more consistently. I currently play with a Dave Trimmer mallet and I highly recommend them once you have established your technique.







                  Where is my local club?
                




Check out the Links section of this website and visit the homepage of your country's croquet organisation - it should have links and contacts to your local club.







                  Isn't croquet just for old people?
                




Not at all.  While a high number of older people play croquet (just as they play golf, bowls, tennis etc.) it is by no means simply a sport for old people.  Like most sports, croquet at the elite level is dominated by players in their 20s and 30s; however, because croquet is a game of strategy as well as skill, with no requirement for speed or reflexes, there are a number of players over 50 and even over 60 who still compete at the highest level.  Stephen Mulliner became world champion for the first time at the age of 62 after starting his croquet career in his 20s!







                  Why play croquet?
                




Croquet is a serious but fun sport played by all ages and genders, all around the world.  It is easy to learn but challenging to master.  It provides excellent mental and physical exercise and a fun yet competitive environment.







                  How do you pronounce "croquet"?
                




In New Zealand, the name of the sport is often pronounced "CROAK-ee", whereas in the UK it tends to be pronounced as "CRO-kay".  In the USA, the emphasis is generally placed on the second syllable - "cro-KAY".




The game





                What is a triple peel?
              




A triple peel (or sometimes a TP for short) is a manoeuvre performed by experienced players whereby they make all their hoops for their own ball, and score the final 3 hoops for their partner ball in the same turn, and win the game.







                How are the scores denoted?
              




The winner of a game is the first side to reach 26 points (or the side which has scored more points after the time limit has elapsed).  In most countries the score is denoted fully e.g. 26-0 or 26-17.  In the UK alone, the score is denoted in a way to show the winning margin e.g. +26 is the same as 26-0 and +9 is the same as 26-17.







                How wide are the hoops?
              




Croquet hoops at club level have a 3-3/4" (three & three-quarter inches) gap for the ball to pass through. A croquet ball is 3-5/8" (three & five-eighths of an inch) wide, meaning there is 1/8th of an inch of clearance between the hoop and the ball.  Hoops at championship level (regional / national etc.) are normally set to have a 3-11/16" (three & eleven-sixteenths of an inch) gap, leaving 1/16th of an inch clearance for the ball.  Depending on the age of the balls used, there could be slight differences in the sizes, and therefore the hoops are often not set to a specific width, but are instead set to the size of the largest ball +1/16th of an inch.  Sometimes this is even reduced to +1/32nd of an inch.







                What is the court "speed"?
              




Croquet courts are measured in seconds (or "Plummers") to denote how fast or slow they are. A court will be timed to see how long it takes for a ball hit from the south boundary, coming to rest on the north boundary. A fast court will only require a gentle tap of the ball to reach from one end to the other, and hence the ball will roll more slowly and take longer to reach its destination.  For a slow court, the opposite is true. Most average courts are about 10-11 seconds.  A slow court would be 8 or 9 seconds; a fast court would be 12 or 13 seconds.  Some may be even faster than this.  A court in the range of 9-12 seconds is generally regarded as "easy". Courts above 12 seconds are less forgiving of poor strokes, and as such tend to reward more skillful players.
